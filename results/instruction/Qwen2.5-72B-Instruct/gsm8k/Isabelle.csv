"To determine the total number of bolts needed for a robe, we need to calculate the amount of blue fiber and white fiber required and then sum them up.

1. The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. The robe requires half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, it will take \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) bolt of white fiber.

Adding the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together:
\[ 2 \text{ (blue bolts)} + 1 \text{ (white bolt)} = 3 \text{ bolts} \]

Therefore, the total number of bolts needed for the robe is 3.

"To determine Josh's profit, we first need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150% of the original purchase price.

1. Calculate the increase in value:
   \[
   \text{Increase in value} = 150\% \times \$80,000 = 1.5 \times \$80,000 = \$120,000
   \]

2. Calculate the new value of the house:
   \[
   \text{New value} = \text{Original value} + \text{Increase in value} = \$80,000 + \$120,000 = \$200,000
   \]

3. Calculate the total cost of the house including repairs:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Original purchase price} + \text{Cost of repairs} = \$80,000 + \$50,000 = \$130,000
   \]

4. Calculate the profit:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{New value} - \text{Total cost} = \$200,000 - \$130,000 = \$70,000
   \]

Therefore, Josh's profit is \$70,000.

"To find out how many total meters James runs a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. James runs 3 sprints each session.
2. Each sprint is 60 meters.
3. He does this 3 times a week.

First, we calculate the total meters he runs in one session:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints/session} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters/session} \]

Next, we calculate the total meters he runs in a week:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

So, the total meters James runs a week is:

"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed required for the entire day for all her chickens.

Each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per day. Wendi has 20 chickens, so the total daily feed requirement is:
\[ 3 \text{ cups/chicken/day} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups/day} \]

Next, we need to account for the feed already given during the morning and afternoon meals. In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed, and in the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed. The total feed given by the end of the afternoon is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how many cups of feed are needed for the final meal, we subtract the total feed already given from the total daily requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To determine the total time it takes for Carla to download the 200 GB file, we need to account for the time spent downloading before the restart, the time lost due to the restart, and the time to download the file again from the beginning.

1. **Initial Download Time Before Restart:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 200 \times 0.40 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, downloading 80 GB takes \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Time Lost Due to Restart:**
   - The restart takes 20 minutes.

3. **Time to Download the File Again:**
   - Since the download has to start from the beginning, the entire 200 GB needs to be downloaded again.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, downloading 200 GB takes \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) minutes.

4. **Total Time:**
   - Total time = Initial download time + Restart time + Time to download again
   - Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 100 minutes = 160 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the distance John travels in each segment of his journey.

1. **Initial Journey Away from Home:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Journey:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles in this time.
   - For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - For the remaining 1.5 hours (since the total return journey is 4 hours and 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 hours have already passed), he drives at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Covered on the Return Journey:**
   - Total distance = 0 miles (standstill) + 15 miles (30 mph) + 120 miles (80 mph) = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - John initially traveled 180 miles away from home.
   - He then traveled 135 miles back towards home.
   - Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

Therefore, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to consider both her regular pay for the first 40 hours and her overtime pay for the additional hours she worked.

1. Calculate the regular pay for the first 40 hours:
   - Regular hourly rate = $10
   - Regular hours worked = 40
   - Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

2. Calculate the overtime pay for the additional 5 hours:
   - Overtime hourly rate = 1.2 * regular hourly rate = 1.2 * $10 = $12
   - Overtime hours worked = 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours
   - Overtime pay = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

3. Calculate the total earnings for the week:
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460.

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. First month: 60 downloads.
2. Second month: The number of downloads is three times the first month, so \( 60 \times 3 = 180 \) downloads.
3. Third month: The number of downloads is reduced by 30% from the second month. A 30% reduction means the program retains 70% of the second month's downloads. So, \( 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \) downloads.

Now, we add the downloads from all three months together:

\( 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \)

366"

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit per year and see when the total profit exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: $90
2. **Annual Income from Lemons**: 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5
3. **Annual Cost for Watering and Feeding**: $3

**Net Annual Profit**:
\[ \text{Net Annual Profit} = \text{Annual Income} - \text{Annual Cost} \]
\[ \text{Net Annual Profit} = \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5 \]

To find out how many years it will take to recover the initial cost:
\[ \text{Number of Years} = \frac{\text{Initial Cost}}{\text{Net Annual Profit}} \]
\[ \text{Number of Years} = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12 \]

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"To determine how many vacuum cleaners Melanie started with, we can work backwards from the information given.

1. Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left after selling half of what was left at the orange house. This means that before selling at the orange house, she had 5 * 2 = 10 vacuum cleaners.

2. Before selling to the red house, she had 10 + 2 = 12 vacuum cleaners (since she sold 2 more to the red house).

3. The 12 vacuum cleaners represent the two-thirds of the total she had after selling a third at the green house. If 12 is two-thirds, then one-third is 12 / 2 = 6 vacuum cleaners.

4. Therefore, the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with is 12 (what was left after the green house) + 6 (what was sold at the green house) = 18 vacuum cleaners.

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Total number of students**: 20
2. **Percentage enrolled in contemporary dance**: 20%

First, calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 20 = \frac{20}{100} \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, determine the number of students remaining after those enrolled in contemporary dance:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

3. **Percentage of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance**: 25%

Calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 16 = \frac{25}{100} \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Now, determine the number of students remaining after those enrolled in jazz dance:
\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

These 12 students are enrolled in hip-hop dance. To find the percentage of the entire class that this represents:
\[ \frac{12}{20} \times 100 = 60\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of the entire class enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her earnings from both her teaching and cheerleading coaching jobs and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She teaches for 35 hours a week.
- She earns $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Earnings from teaching = 35 hours/week * $20/hour * 50 weeks/year

Now, let's calculate her earnings from cheerleading coaching:
- She coaches for 15 hours a week.
- She earns $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Earnings from coaching = 15 hours/week * $30/hour * 50 weeks/year

Now, we add the two amounts to get her total annual salary.

Total annual salary = Earnings from teaching + Earnings from coaching

Let's do the math:

Earnings from teaching = 35 * 20 * 50 = $35,000
Earnings from coaching = 15 * 30 * 50 = $22,500

Total annual salary = $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we first need to calculate the total time she should take to complete the 12-mile trail.

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given that Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour over a 12-mile trail, we can set up the equation:
\[ 4 = \frac{12}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Solving for Total Time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already taken 2 hours to walk the first 6 miles (1 hour for the first 4 miles and another hour for the next 2 miles). Therefore, she has 1 hour left to complete the remaining 6 miles.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, we use the formula for speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in both the orange drink and the pineapple drink, and then sum these amounts after accounting for the spill.

First, let's calculate the amount of water in the orange drink:
- The orange drink is 10 liters, and two-thirds of it is water.
- Therefore, the amount of water in the orange drink is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \) liters.

However, 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, so we need to adjust the amount of water:
- The amount of water in 1 liter of orange drink is \( \frac{2}{3} \) liters.
- Therefore, the amount of water lost in the spill is \( \frac{2}{3} \) liters.
- The remaining amount of water in the orange drink is \( \frac{20}{3} - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) liters.

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink:
- The pineapple drink is 15 liters, and three-fifths of it is water.
- Therefore, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \) liters.

Now, we add the remaining water from the orange drink to the water from the pineapple drink:
- Total water = 6 liters (from the orange drink) + 9 liters (from the pineapple drink) = 15 liters.

Thus, the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture is 15 liters.

"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Raymond's current age.
2. Calculate the age of Raymond when his son was born.
3. Subtract the age Raymond was when his son was born from his current age to find out how many years ago his son was born.

First, we know that Samantha is 31 years old and Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha. Therefore, Raymond's current age is:

31 (Samantha's age) + 6 (years older than Samantha) = 37 years old.

Raymond had his son when he was 23 years old. To find out how many years ago this was, we subtract the age Raymond was when his son was born from his current age:

37 (Raymond's current age) - 23 (age when his son was born) = 14 years ago.

So, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.

"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday, we can break down the sales by the number of DVDs each group of customers bought:

- The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so that's 3 customers * 1 DVD/customer = 3 DVDs.
- The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so that's 2 customers * 2 DVDs/customer = 4 DVDs.
- The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so that's 3 customers * 0 DVDs/customer = 0 DVDs.

Now, we add up all the DVDs sold:

3 DVDs + 4 DVDs + 0 DVDs = 7 DVDs.

Therefore, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To find the original price of the book, we can set up the equation based on the information that Kyle bought the book at a 25% discount. This means Kyle paid 75% of the original price. Let \( P \) be the original price of the book. The equation is:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

\[ P = 26.00 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to calculate the total cost of the other items she bought and then subtract that from the total amount she paid. After that, we can divide the remaining amount by the cost of one box of pizza to find out how many boxes she ordered.

First, let's calculate the cost of the chicken meal, the milk, and the apples:

- The chicken meal costs $12.
- The 5 packs of milk cost 5 * $3 = $15.
- The 4 apples cost 4 * $1.50 = $6.

Now, let's add up these costs:

$12 (chicken meal) + $15 (milk) + $6 (apples) = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50, so the amount spent on pizza is:

$50 (total) - $33 (other items) = $17.

Now, we divide the amount spent on pizza by the cost of one box to find out how many boxes she ordered:

$17 / $8.50 (cost per box) = 2.

Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

Step 1: Total servings consumed in 60 days
Cynthia eats 1 serving per day, so in 60 days, she will eat:
1 serving/day * 60 days = 60 servings

Step 2: Number of cartons needed
Each carton contains 15 servings, so the number of cartons needed is:
60 servings / 15 servings/carton = 4 cartons

Step 3: Total cost
Each carton costs $4.00, so the total cost for 4 cartons is:
4 cartons * $4.00/carton = $16.00

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we can break down the trip into segments based on the information provided:

1. Henry's first stop was after 20 miles.
2. The second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip, which means he stopped at the 45-mile mark (60 miles - 15 miles = 45 miles).

The distance between the first and second stops is the difference between the distance at which he made the second stop and the distance at which he made the first stop:

45 miles - 20 miles = 25 miles

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

"To find the cost of the boots, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pairs of high heels. One pair of heels costs $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, which is $33 * 2 = $66.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots, we can set up the following equation to find the cost of the boots:

Cost of boots = Cost of two pairs of high heels + $5

Cost of boots = $99 + $5 = $104

Therefore, the boots cost $104.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and their total age.

The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11. This means that for every 7 units of Darrell's age, Allen's age is 11 units. Together, these units add up to 162, which is their total age.

First, we find the total number of units in the ratio:
7 (for Darrell) + 11 (for Allen) = 18 units

Next, we determine the value of one unit by dividing the total age by the total number of units:
162 / 18 = 9

Now, we can find Allen's current age by multiplying the value of one unit by the number of units for Allen:
11 units * 9 = 99

Allen's current age is 99. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
99 + 10 = 109

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109.

"To find the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to first determine what each friend guessed and then calculate the average of those guesses.

1. The first friend guessed 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guessed 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guessed 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 80 + 20, which is 100.

Now, we add up all the guesses and divide by the number of guesses to find the average:

80 (first guess) + 60 (second guess) + 100 (third guess) = 240

To find the average:

240 / 3 = 80

The average guess is 80.

"To find out how many gold coins Gretchen has, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as:
\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know \( S \) (the number of silver coins), we can find \( G \) (the number of gold coins) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To find out how many total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the second 20 minutes and then add them to the points he scored in the first 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4 points:
25% of 4 = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 1 point more than the 4 points he scored in the first 20 minutes:
4 points + 1 point = 5 points

Now, we add the points from both periods to get the total points:
4 points (first 20 minutes) + 5 points (second 20 minutes) = 9 points

Therefore, Mike scored a total of 9 points.

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine the cost per yogurt based on the sale price.
3. Calculate the total cost for the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.

Step 1: Total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats:
2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts

Step 2: Cost per yogurt
The sale price is 4 yogurts for $5.00, so the cost per yogurt is:
$5.00 / 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt

Step 3: Total cost for 30 days
The total cost for 60 yogurts is:
60 yogurts * $1.25 per yogurt = $75.00

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

"John initially has 13 lego sets. After selling them, he uses the money to buy video games and has $5 left over. To find out how many lego sets he still has, we need to determine if he sold all of them or not.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets:
13 lego sets * $15 per set = $195

Next, we calculate the total cost of the video games he buys:
8 video games * $20 per game = $160

Now, we add the $5 he has left to the cost of the video games to see if it matches the total amount he made from selling the lego sets:
$160 + $5 = $165

Since $165 is less than the $195 he made from selling the lego sets, it means he did sell all of his lego sets. Therefore, the number of lego sets he still has is:

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his average speed. Speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time.

John runs 60 miles a week over 3 days. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. On the other two days, he runs for half as much time, which is 1.5 hours each day.

First, let's calculate the total time he spends running in a week:
- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: 1.5 hours
- Third day: 1.5 hours

Total time = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

Now, we can calculate his average speed:
- Total distance = 60 miles
- Total time = 6 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine Dana's walking and running speeds based on the information given about her skipping speed.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - We know that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and this is half as fast as she can run.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Dana can run at a speed four times faster than she can walk.
   - If her running speed is 6 miles per hour, then her walking speed is \(6 \div 4 = 1.5\) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking over a total of 6 hours.
   - Time spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Time spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running and walking:**
   - Distance while running: \( 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \).
   - Distance while walking: \( 1.5 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \).

5. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking = \( 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \).

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 18 miles.

"To determine how far outside of the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to calculate the increased throwing distance and then subtract the dragon's flame reach.

1. Polly's normal throwing distance is 400 feet.
2. When holding the sapphire gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin three times farther, so:
   \( 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \)

3. The dragon's flame reach is 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from Polly's throwing distance with the gemstone:
   \( 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \)

Polly can stand 200 feet outside of the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to calculate the total number of calories you can still consume without exceeding your daily calorie target.

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume are:

2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories

Next, we need to find out how many grams of chips correspond to 200 calories. We know that one serving of chips is 250 calories and the 300g bag has 5 servings. Therefore, each serving is:

300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving

Since 250 calories are in 60g of chips, we can calculate how many grams of chips 200 calories would be:

(200 calories / 250 calories) * 60g = 48g

Therefore, you can eat 48 grams of chips without exceeding your daily calorie target.

"To determine Charlie's net profit from making and selling 20 candles, we need to calculate the total cost of the supplies and the total revenue from selling the candles, then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

1. **Calculate the total number of pounds of beeswax needed:**
   - Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, to make 20 candles, Charlie needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the beeswax and wicks:**
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00. Therefore, for 2 pounds, the cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times 10 \text{ dollars per pound} = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times 2 \text{ dollars per candle} = 40 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
     \[
     40 \text{ dollars} - 20 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:

"To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we first need to determine the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply by the average time it takes to write one article.

1. **Number of articles on Monday:**
   - Meredith wrote 5 articles.

2. **Number of articles on Tuesday:**
   - She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday.
   - \( \frac{2}{5} \) of 5 articles is \( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 2 \) more articles.
   - Therefore, the total number of articles on Tuesday is \( 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.

3. **Number of articles on Wednesday:**
   - She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.
   - Twice 7 articles is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

4. **Total number of articles over the three days:**
   - Total articles = Articles on Monday + Articles on Tuesday + Articles on Wednesday
   - Total articles = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles

5. **Total number of hours spent writing:**

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice used at work.
2. Calculate the total number of Post-it notes Candice had after purchasing the package.
3. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she originally had from the total to find out how many were in the package.

Step 1: Candice placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee, so she used 220 Post-it notes.

Step 2: After placing the Post-it notes on the cups, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes she had before using them at work is the sum of the Post-it notes used and the Post-it notes remaining:
\[ \text{Total Post-it notes} = 220 + 23 = 243 \]

Step 3: Candice originally had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. The number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is the difference between the total number of Post-it notes and the number she originally had:
\[ \text{Post-it notes in the package} = 243 - 80 = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package that she purchased is 163.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of blue ties John bought:**
   - John spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40.
   - Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
   - Number of blue ties = $200 / $40 = 5 blue ties

2. **Determine the number of red ties John bought:**
   - John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
   - Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
   - Number of red ties = 2 * 5 = 10 red ties

3. **Determine the cost of each red tie:**
   - The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties.
   - Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + 50% of the cost of each blue tie
   - Cost of each red tie = $40 + 0.5 * $40 = $40 + $20 = $60

4. **Calculate the total amount spent on red ties:**
   - Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
   - Total spent on red ties = 10 * $60 = $600

5. **Calculate the total amount spent on all ties:**
   - Total spent on all ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
   - Total spent on all ties = $200 + $600 = $800

Therefore, John spent a total of $800 on ties.

"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.
2. Calculate the daily income from selling the eggs.
3. Calculate the weekly income by multiplying the daily income by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Step 1: Number of dozens of eggs produced per day
There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.
252 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 21 dozens

Step 2: Daily income from selling the eggs
Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, so we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen.
21 dozens * $2 per dozen = $42

Step 3: Weekly income
To find the weekly income, we multiply the daily income by 7.
$42 per day * 7 days = $294

"To determine how long it takes Tom to get back, we first need to calculate the distance he travels from 1 to 4 PM.

Tom sails from 1 to 4 PM, which is a total of 3 hours. Since his ship travels at 10 miles per hour, the distance he covers is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to travel back the same distance at a rate of 6 miles per hour, the time it takes is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

"First, let's calculate the total weight of the 30 comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, the total weight of the comic books is:

30 comic books * 1/4 pound/comic book = 7.5 pounds

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, he still needs to remove:

15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds

Now, we need to find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove to get rid of the remaining 7.5 pounds. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys he needs to remove is:

7.5 pounds / (1/2 pound/toy) = 7.5 pounds * (2 toys/pound) = 15 toys

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

1. Calculate the total number of classes Judy teaches in a week.
2. Calculate the total number of students Judy teaches in a week.
3. Calculate the total amount of money Judy makes by multiplying the total number of students by the charge per student.

First, let's find the total number of classes Judy teaches in a week:
- On weekdays (Monday to Friday), she teaches 5 classes each day. So, for 5 days, that's 5 classes/day * 5 days = 25 classes.
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.

So, the total number of classes in a week is 25 (weekdays) + 8 (Saturday) = 33 classes.

Next, let's find the total number of students Judy teaches in a week:
- Each class has 15 students, so for 33 classes, that's 33 classes * 15 students/class = 495 students.

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of money Judy makes:
- She charges $15.00 per student, so for 495 students, that's 495 students * $15.00/student = $7,425.00.

Therefore, Judy makes $7,425.00 in one week.

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level, starting from the top and working our way down.

Given that the top level (Level 4) has a square footage of 16, and each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of the other levels as follows:

- Level 4: 16 square feet
- Level 3: 16 * 2 = 32 square feet
- Level 2: 32 * 2 = 64 square feet
- Level 1: 64 * 2 = 128 square feet

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels and divide by the number of levels to find the average:

Total square footage = 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet

Number of levels = 4

Average square footage per level = Total square footage / Number of levels = 240 / 4 = 60 square feet

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, determine how much water each girl received. Since each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water:
   \[ \text{Water per girl} = \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

2. Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they both received is:
   \[ \text{Total water for girls} = 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

3. The boy received 6 liters of water.

4. Now, add the water received by the girls and the boy to find the total amount of water used:
   \[ \text{Total water used} = 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

5. Subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water to find the amount of water left:

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( W \) represent the number of games won, and \( L \) represent the number of games lost. According to the problem, the team played a total of 22 games, so we have:

\[ W + L = 22 \]

We are also told that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which gives us another equation:

\[ W = L + 8 \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know \( L \), we can find \( W \):

\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"To determine how many pounds of potato salad Ted the T-Rex needs to bring to the picnic, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of potato salad the adult dinosaurs will eat.
2. Calculate the total amount of potato salad the child dinosaurs will eat.
3. Add the two amounts together to get the total amount of potato salad needed.

First, we calculate the amount of potato salad the adult dinosaurs will eat:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adult dinosaurs.
- Therefore, the total amount of potato salad for the adults is \( 10 \text{ lbs/adult} \times 20 \text{ adults} = 200 \text{ lbs} \).

Next, we calculate the amount of potato salad the child dinosaurs will eat:
- Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats \( \frac{10 \text{ lbs}}{2} = 5 \text{ lbs} \).
- There are 5 child dinosaurs.
- Therefore, the total amount of potato salad for the children is \( 5 \text{ lbs/child} \times 5 \text{ children} = 25 \text{ lbs} \).

Finally, we add the two amounts together to get the total amount of potato salad needed:
- Total potato salad needed = \( 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs} \).

So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Gerald's original time:**
   - We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
   - Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald.
   - Therefore, Gerald's original time was \( 38 + 2 = 40 \) seconds.

2. **Calculate Gerald's improved time:**
   - Gerald improved his speed by 10%.
   - A 10% improvement in speed means he can run 10% faster, which translates to a 10% reduction in time.
   - To find the new time, we calculate 10% of 40 seconds and subtract it from 40 seconds.
   - 10% of 40 seconds is \( 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \) seconds.

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the original volume of tomatoes before cooking.
2. Calculate how many cans of tomatoes were used.
3. Convert the number of cans into the number of tomatoes.

Step 1: Determine the original volume of tomatoes before cooking.
Since the volume of the tomatoes is halved when cooked into sauce, the original volume of tomatoes must have been twice the volume of the sauce. Freda made 32 ounces of sauce, so the original volume of tomatoes was:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Step 2: Calculate how many cans of tomatoes were used.
Each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes. To find out how many cans were used, we divide the total original volume by the volume of one can:
\[ 64 \text{ ounces} \div 16 \text{ ounces/can} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Step 3: Convert the number of cans into the number of tomatoes.
Each can contains three tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:
\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

So, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of cars**: There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.
2. **Cars that took an exit**: 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.
3. **Remaining cars**: After 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars left in the line is \(30 - 5 = 25\) cars.
4. **Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes**: 20 cars drove through in the last 15 minutes of the traffic jam.
5. **Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes**: Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \(x\).

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the last 15 minutes, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

Solving for \(x\):
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

2. Next, we find out how many pieces are left after Poppy has placed her pieces:
   \[ \text{Remaining pieces after Poppy} = 1000 - 250 = 750 \]

3. Then, we calculate how many pieces Poppy's mom places. She places a third of the remaining 750 pieces:
   \[ \text{Pieces placed by Poppy's mom} = \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \]

4. Finally, we determine how many pieces are left to be placed after Poppy's mom has placed her pieces:
   \[ \text{Remaining pieces after Poppy's mom} = 750 - 250 = 500 \]

So, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is 500.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box by subtracting the thickness of the walls from each dimension. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The inner dimensions will be:

- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:

Inner volume of one box = Length * Width * Height
Inner volume of one box = 3 inches * 4 inches * 2 inches
Inner volume of one box = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:

Total inner volume = Inner volume of one box * Number of boxes
Total inner volume = 24 cubic inches * 3
Total inner volume = 72 cubic inches

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the total time he spent watching TV each night and then solve for the unknown.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: \( x \) 30-minute episodes
- Thursday: 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

The total time spent watching TV is 7 hours. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 1 + 1 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 5.5 + 0.5x = 7 \]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

\[ 0.5x = 1.5 \]

Divide both sides by 0.5:

\[ x = 3 \]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30-minute shows on Wednesday.

"To find out how many cookies Henry baked last year, we can work backwards from the information given.

1. Henry ends up with 110 cookies after dropping 5. This means before dropping any, he had:
   \( 110 + 5 = 115 \) cookies.

2. The 115 cookies are 15 more than he intended to bake, so the number of cookies he intended to bake is:
   \( 115 - 15 = 100 \) cookies.

3. He intended to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year, so the number of cookies he baked last year is:
   \( 100 \div 2 = 50 \) cookies.

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate on average, we first need to calculate the total area of the fruit roll-ups each of them had.

For Beatrice:
- Her fruit roll-up was 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- The total area for Beatrice's roll-up is \(2 \times 24 = 48\) roll-ups.

For Marcell:
- His fruit roll-up was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- The total area for Marcell's roll-up is \(3 \times 14 = 42\) roll-ups.

"To determine how much water Julia's boat took on by the time she reached shore, we need to calculate the total distance she rowed and then use that to find out how much water entered the boat.

First, we know that it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet. The shore was 64 seconds away, so we can calculate the total distance she rowed by setting up a proportion:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{x \text{ feet}}{64 \text{ seconds}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{20 \text{ feet} \times 64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}} \]
\[ x = \frac{1280 \text{ feet} \cdot \text{seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}} \]
\[ x = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. To find out how much water the boat took on over 80 feet, we set up another proportion:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = \frac{y \text{ liters}}{80 \text{ feet}} \]

Solving for \( y \):

\[ y = \frac{2 \text{ liters} \times 80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} \]
\[ y = \frac{160 \text{ liters} \cdot \text{feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} \]
\[ y = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached shore.

"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue she will make from selling it at the new, increased price. Then, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - She bought 10 boards at $10 each.
   - Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

2. **Calculate the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - She bought 5 boards at $16 each.
   - Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

3. **Calculate the total cost of all the lumber:**
   - Total cost = Cost of 2 x 4 x 10 boards + Cost of 4 x 4 x 10 boards
   - Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

4. **Determine the new selling price for each type of board:**
   - The price of lumber has increased by 50%.
   - New price for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = $10 * 1.50 = $15 each.
   - New price for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = $16 * 1.50 = $24 each.

5. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Total revenue for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $15/board = $150.

6. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Total revenue for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $24/board = $120.

7. **Calculate the total revenue from selling all the lumber:**
   - Total revenue = Revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards + Revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards
   - Total revenue = $150 + $120 = $270.

8. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.
   - Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago.
   - Therefore, \( 40,000 = L + 0.30L \).
   - Simplifying, \( 40,000 = 1.30L \).
   - Solving for \( L \), \( L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} \).
   - \( L = 30,769.23 \) (approximately).

2. **Determine Adrien's salary four years later:**
   - Adrien's salary increased by 40% from four years ago.
   - Adrien's salary four years later = \( 40,000 + 0.40 \times 40,000 \).
   - \( 40,000 + 16,000 = 56,000 \).

3. **Determine Lylah's salary four years later:**
   - Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's.
   - Lylah's salary four years later = \( 30,769.23 + 0.40 \times 30,769.23 \).
   - \( 30,769.23 + 12,307.69 = 43,076.92 \).

4. **Calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later:**
   - Total salary = Adrien's salary + Lylah's salary.
   - Total salary = \( 56,000 + 43,076.92 \).
   - Total salary = \( 99,076.92 \).

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:

- Therefore, the number of questions he completed is \(5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ questions}\).
- The test had 75 questions in total, so the number of questions he left incomplete is \(75 - 40 = 35\).

For the second test:
- Mark completed the test at the same rate of 5 questions per hour.
- He had 6 hours to complete the test.
- Therefore, the number of questions he completed is \(5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ questions}\).
- The test had 100 questions in total, so the number of questions he left incomplete is \(100 - 30 = 70\).

Adding the incomplete questions from both tests:
- Total incomplete questions = \(35 + 70 = 105\).

"To find the number of pink gumballs, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as \( B \) and the number of pink gumballs as \( P \).

According to the problem, there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. This can be written as:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

We are also given that there are 12 blue gumballs, so \( B = 12 \).

Substituting \( B = 12 \) into the equation:
\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

So, there are 70 pink gumballs.

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. 

The number of semi-automatic cars is:
20 (total cars) - 12 (automatic cars) - 4 (manual cars) = 4 (semi-automatic cars)

To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given:

- Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.
- Let \( B \) represent the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) represent the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we know:
1. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \).
2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
3. The total number of bees in the hive is 700: \( Q + B + W = 700 \).

First, substitute \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ W = 2(2Q) = 4Q \]

Now, substitute \( B \) and \( W \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200 \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is:

"To determine how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Jordan spends playing video games in one week.
2. Determine how much he would earn if he worked those hours instead.

First, Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, Jordan earns $10 per hour at his part-time job. If he worked the 14 hours he usually spends playing video games, he would earn:
\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 140 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Therefore, Jordan would earn $140 in one week if he spent his video game time working instead.

"To calculate the total cost, we first need to determine which items are nonfood and then apply the 10% tax to those items. Milk and eggs are food items, so they are not taxed. The nonfood items are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps.

The cost of the food items is:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
Total for food items: $2 + $3 = $5

The cost of the nonfood items before tax is:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4
Total for nonfood items: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

The tax on the nonfood items is 10% of $10, which is:
$10 * 0.10 = $1

The total cost of the nonfood items after tax is:
$10 + $1 = $11

The total cost for everything is the sum of the food items and the taxed nonfood items:
$5 + $11 = $16

"To calculate Kim's weekly profit, we need to determine his total expenses and subtract them from his total income.

First, let's calculate the total number of clients:
- Current clients: 3
- Potential clients: 5
- Total clients: 3 + 5 = 8

Next, we calculate the total expenses for the cleaning supplies:
- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
- Cost of bleach per client: 2 bottles * $2/bottle = $4
- Cost of cloths per client: 1 pack * $5/pack = $5
- Total cost per client: $4 (bleach) + $5 (cloths) = $9

Now, we calculate the total expenses for all clients:
- Total expenses: 8 clients * $9/client = $72

Kim's total income is given as $92.

Finally, we calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total income - Total expenses
- Profit = $92 - $72 = $20

Therefore, Kim will make a profit of $20 each week.

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per harvest: Since John has 10 hectares and there are 100 pineapples per hectare, the total number of pineapples per harvest is \(10 \times 100 = 1000\) pineapples.

2. Determine the number of harvests in a year: Since John can harvest every 3 months, and there are 12 months in a year, the number of harvests in a year is \(12 \div 3 = 4\) harvests.

3. Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year: Multiply the number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year, which is \(1000 \times 4 = 4000\) pineapples.

"To find out how many blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the total number of pieces from all the Lego sets he dumped on the floor.

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, which means it has \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first set, which means it has \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

Now, we add up all the pieces from the three sets:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

So, Johnny picks up 2125 blocks.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and calculate the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the 30 bees return, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.
3. In the following 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 bees leave the hive, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.
4. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before and hadn't already returned comes back to the hive. This means the bees that left in the first 6 hours (30 bees) and the bees that left in the third 6-hour period (60 bees) minus the bees that returned in the second 6-hour period (15 bees) will return.

So, the total number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is:
\[ 30 + 60 - 15 = 75 \]

Therefore, Debra saw 75 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then add the change she received to this amount.

The cost of 1 adult ticket is $12.
The cost of 1 child ticket is $10.

The total cost for 1 adult and 1 child ticket is:
$12 (adult ticket) + $10 (child ticket) = $22

Brittany's mom received $8 in change, which means the amount she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets plus the change she received:
$22 (total cost of tickets) + $8 (change) = $30

Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home and then find the difference between these times.

First, we need to convert the distances from miles to feet because the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance to home in feet:
3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet

Tim's distance to home in feet:
2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home by dividing the distance by the speed.

Steve's time to get home:
15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes

Tim's time to get home:
10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

The difference in time, which is how long the winner will be waiting, is:
40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

The winner will be waiting for 4 minutes.

"To calculate how much Shawnda made, we need to determine the total number of tires she inflated and then multiply that by the cost per tire.

- Bicycles have 2 tires each. If 5 people came by with bicycles, that's 5 bicycles * 2 tires/bicycle = 10 tires.
- Tricycles have 3 tires each. If 3 people came by with tricycles, that's 3 tricycles * 3 tires/tricycle = 9 tires.
- A unicycle has 1 tire. If 1 person came by with a unicycle, that's 1 unicycle * 1 tire/unicycle = 1 tire.

Now, we add up all the tires: 10 tires (bicycles) + 9 tires (tricycles) + 1 tire (unicycle) = 20 tires.

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, so the total amount made is 20 tires * 25 cents/tire = 500 cents.

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert 500 cents to dollars: 500 cents / 100 cents/dollar = 5 dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final number of fries left to the original number. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Final fries left:** 5 fries.
2. **Ants carried off 1 fry:** Before the ants, there were \(5 + 1 = 6\) fries.
3. **Raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries:** If the raccoon stole two-thirds, then one-third was left. So, the 6 fries represent one-third of the fries before the raccoon took them. Therefore, before the raccoon, there were \(6 \times 3 = 18\) fries.
4. **Three pigeons each ate 3 fries:** The pigeons ate a total of \(3 \times 3 = 9\) fries. So, before the pigeons, there were \(18 + 9 = 27\) fries.
5. **Seagull ate half the amount Dave ate:** Dave ate 14 fries, so the seagull ate \(14 / 2 = 7\) fries. Therefore, before the seagull, there were \(27 + 7 = 34\) fries.
6. **Dave ate 14 fries:** Before Dave, there were \(34 + 14 = 48\) fries.

So, the original number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was:

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the weekly class hours and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on each type of day:

- **Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays**: Kimo has 3 classes, each 1 hour long.
  \[
  3 \text{ classes} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours/day}
  \]
  Since there are 3 such days in a week:
  \[
  3 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

- **Tuesdays and Thursdays**: Kimo has 2 classes, each 2 hours long.
  \[
  2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours/day}
  \]
  Since there are 2 such days in a week:
  \[
  4 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days/week} = 8 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

Next, we add the hours from all days to get the total weekly class hours:
\[
9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Finally, we multiply the weekly class hours by the number of weeks in the semester to get the total class hours for the semester:
\[
17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:

"To find the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit, in this case, feet. 

1. **Convert the length of the rolls to feet:**
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so each roll is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls, so the total length of the rolls is \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.

2. **Convert the length of the croissants to feet:**
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Each croissant is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 120 croissants, so the total length of the croissants is \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.

3. **Length of the baguettes:**
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

4. **Total length of all baked goods:**
   - Add the lengths of the rolls, croissants, and baguettes: \( 100 + 60 + 120 = 280 \) feet.

The total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end is 280 feet.

"To determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser, we first need to calculate the total distance each person runs.

**Blake's Distance:**
Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Each back-and-forth run is 200 yards (100 yards there and 100 yards back).

\[ \text{Blake's total distance} = 15 \times 200 \text{ yards} = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

**Kelly's Distance:**
Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field, and then runs back and forth 34 times to the 40-yard line. The distance to the 40-yard line and back is 80 yards (40 yards there and 40 yards back).

\[ \text{Kelly's total distance} = 1 \times 200 \text{ yards} + 34 \times 80 \text{ yards} \]
\[ \text{Kelly's total distance} = 200 \text{ yards} + 2720 \text{ yards} = 2920 \text{ yards} \]

**Difference in Distance:**
To find out how much farther the winner runs than the loser, we subtract Kelly's total distance from Blake's total distance.

\[ \text{Difference} = 3000 \text{ yards} - 2920 \text{ yards} = 80 \text{ yards} \]

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial price and the increase rate:**
   - Initial price of the bag of marbles: $20
   - Increase rate: 20% of the original price every two months

2. **Determine the number of price increases over 36 months:**
   - Since the price increases every two months, the number of increases in 36 months is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \).

3. **Calculate the price after each increase:**
   - Each increase is 20% of the original price, which is \( 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, each increase adds $4 to the original price.

4. **Calculate the total increase over 18 periods:**
   - Total increase = \( 18 \times 4 = 72 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the final price:**
   - Final price = Initial price + Total increase
   - Final price = \( 20 + 72 = 92 \) dollars.

However, this approach assumes a linear increase, but the problem states that the price increases by 20% of the original price, not the current price. This means the price increases by a fixed amount of $4 every two months, which is a linear increase, not a compound one.

Thus, the final price after 36 months is $92.

"To find the total worth of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then sum them up.

1. **Red Cars**: There are 5 red cars, and each costs $4.
   - Total cost of red cars = 5 * $4 = $20

2. **Action Figures**: There are 3 action figures, and each costs $5.
   - Total cost of action figures = 3 * $5 = $15

3. **Doll**: The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
   - Cost of one action figure = $5
   - Cost of 3 action figures = 3 * $5 = $15
   - Therefore, the cost of the doll = $15

Now, we sum up the costs of all the toys:
- Total cost of all toys = Cost of red cars + Cost of action figures + Cost of doll
- Total cost of all toys = $20 + $15 + $15 = $50

The total worth of all the toys is $50.

"Let's denote Seth's current age as \( S \) and Brooke's current age as \( B \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

We can simplify the second equation:
\[ S + 2 + B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:

1. Calculate the total minimum monthly payment:
   - Student loans: $300
   - Credit card: $200
   - Mortgage: $500
   Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

2. Calculate the 50% increase on the total minimum monthly payment:
   50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

3. Calculate the total monthly payment with the 50% increase:
   Total monthly payment = $1000 + $500 = $1500

4. Calculate the total annual payment:
   Total annual payment = $1500 * 12 = $18000

Therefore, Jessica will pay $18000 in a year.

"To determine the total time it will take Billy to prep the potatoes, we need to calculate the time for peeling and cutting all 60 potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time for peeling:
- It takes 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total peeling time is \( 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, let's calculate the time for cutting:
- It takes 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total cutting time is \( 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 300 \text{ seconds} \).

Convert the cutting time to minutes:
- \( 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 5 \text{ minutes} \).

Now, add the peeling and cutting times together:
- Total time = 90 minutes (peeling) + 5 minutes (cutting) = 95 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to first calculate their total revenue and then their total costs, including the cost of lemons.

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They made a profit of $25.
   - Let's denote the total revenue as \( R \) and the total cost as \( C \).
   - The profit formula is: \( \text{Profit} = R - C \).
   - Given the profit is $25, we have: \( 25 = R - C \).

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The cost to make one gallon of lemonade is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, totaling $5 per gallon.
   - Let \( G \) be the number of gallons they made.
   - The total cost \( C \) is then \( 5G \).

3. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon.
   - The revenue from one gallon is \( 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \) dollars.
   - The total revenue \( R \) is then \( 10G \).

4. **Set up the profit equation:**
   - Substitute \( R \) and \( C \) into the profit equation: \( 25 = 10G - 5G \).
   - Simplify: \( 25 = 5G \).
   - Solve for \( G \): \( G = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) gallons.

5. **Calculate the cost of lemons:**
   - The cost of lemons per gallon is $3.
   - For 5 gallons, the total cost of lemons is \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) dollars.

Therefore, the amount spent on lemons is $15.

"To find out how many girls were on the Chinese team, we first need to determine the total number of Chinese participants in the race. Since there were 240 Asians in total and 80 of them were Japanese, we can subtract the number of Japanese participants from the total number of Asians to find the number of Chinese participants:

240 (total Asians) - 80 (Japanese) = 160 (Chinese)

Now, we know that there were 60 boys on the Chinese team. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

160 (Chinese) - 60 (boys) = 100 (girls)

So, there were 100 girls on the Chinese team.

"To determine how much money Zaid will have left after all his expenses and donations, let's break down his monthly expenses step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount spent on rent:**
   Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount spent on car fuel:**
   Zaid spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount donated to charity:**
   Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining amount after the donation:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount after donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total amount given to his daughter and wife:**
   Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars.
   \[
   \text{Total given to family} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Calculate the final remaining amount:**
   \[
   \text{Final remaining amount} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, after all these expenses and donations, Zaid will still have 350 dollars.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Bo has 40 crabs.
2. Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has \(40 - 4 = 36\) crabs.
3. Rani has ten more crabs than Monic, so Rani has \(36 + 10 = 46\) crabs.

Now, to find the total number of crabs the three have together, we add the number of crabs each person has:

- Bo: 40 crabs
- Monic: 36 crabs
- Rani: 46 crabs

Total number of crabs = \(40 + 36 + 46 = 122\)

"To find out how much Lloyd earned for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd tutored for 5 hours at a rate of $10 per hour. So, his earnings for the first week are:
5 hours * $10/hour = $50

For the second week, Lloyd tutored for 8 hours at the same rate of $10 per hour. So, his earnings for the second week are:
8 hours * $10/hour = $80

Now, we add the earnings from both weeks to find the total:
$50 + $80 = $130

Therefore, Lloyd earned $130 for the first two weeks.

"To find the number of votes the loser got, we first need to determine the number of votes the winner received. The winner got 3/4 of the total votes. Since the total number of students who voted is 80, we calculate the winner's votes as follows:

Winner's votes = (3/4) * 80

Now, to find the number of votes the loser got, we subtract the winner's votes from the total number of votes:

Loser's votes = Total votes - Winner's votes

Let's do the calculations:

Winner's votes = (3/4) * 80 = 60

Loser's votes = 80 - 60 = 20

The number of votes the loser got is 20.

"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we first need to find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the 200 pink calla lilies are five times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( C \).

Given:
\[ 200 = 5C \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Since she ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can calculate the number of red roses as follows:
\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the ages:**
   - Jan's current age is 30.
   - Let Mark's current age be \( M \).
   - Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's current age is \( M + 2 \).

2. **Two years ago:**
   - Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).
   - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).

3. **Given condition:**
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.
   - This can be written as: \( M - 2 = \frac{28}{2} + 5 \).

4. **Solve for \( M \):**
   - \( M - 2 = 14 + 5 \)
   - \( M - 2 = 19 \)
   - \( M = 19 + 2 \)
   - \( M = 21 \)

5. **Determine Jean's age:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's age is \( M + 2 \).
   - Jean's age is \( 21 + 2 = 23 \).

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old.

"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time each team takes to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay.

**Team A (Well-Rounded Team):**
Each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time for Team A = 4 * 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

**Team B (Less Well-Rounded Team):**
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Total time for Team B = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

**Difference in Time:**
Difference = Total time for Team B - Total time for Team A
Difference = 222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

1. The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die:
   - The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - The probability is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \) or 50%.

2. The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on one roll is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \).
   - Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \) or 25%.

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row. This can be calculated as the difference in probabilities, expressed as a percentage of the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[ 50\% - 25\% = 25\% \]

To express this difference as a percentage of the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:
\[ \frac{25\%}{25\%} \times 100\% = 100\% \]

So, it is 100% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"To find out how many rats are in each cage, let's break down the information given:

1. The total number of pieces of straw distributed is 160.
2. The rabbits receive 20 pieces of straw.
3. Each of the 10 cages of hamsters receives 5 pieces of straw, so the total for the hamsters is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) pieces of straw.
4. The remaining straw is for the rats. We can calculate this by subtracting the straw given to the rabbits and hamsters from the total: \(160 - 20 - 50 = 90\) pieces of straw for the rats.
5. Each rat receives 6 pieces of straw, so the total number of rats is \(90 \div 6 = 15\) rats.
6. The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, so the number of rats in each cage is \(15 \div 3 = 5\).

Therefore, there are 5 rats in each cage.

"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total expenses and then divide by the number of friends.

1. **Cost of tickets**: $20.25 for 3 tickets.
2. **Cost of food**: They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets, so the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.
3. **Cost of rides**: They went on 2 different rides, each costing $33, so the total cost for the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
- Total cost of tickets: $20.25
- Total cost of food: $15.75
- Total cost of rides: $66

Total expenses = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102

"To determine how many trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the net number of trees Tom plants each year.
2. Determine the total number of trees after 10 years.
3. Calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years.
4. Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees to find the final number of trees.

Step 1: Net number of trees planted each year
Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year, so the net number of trees he adds each year is:
10 - 2 = 8 trees

Step 2: Total number of trees after 10 years
Starting with 50 trees, and adding 8 trees each year for 10 years, the total number of trees after 10 years is:
50 + (8 * 10) = 50 + 80 = 130 trees

Step 3: Number of trees that die after 10 years
30% of the trees die, so the number of trees that die is:
30% of 130 = 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees

Step 4: Final number of trees
Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees:
130 - 39 = 91 trees

Therefore, the final number of trees Tom has left is:

"To find out how many Pokemon cards Elaine has now in total, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. After a month, she collected three times the initial number, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is 60 + 40 = 100 cards. Therefore, in the third month, she collected 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, to find the total number of cards Elaine has, we add the initial number of cards to the cards collected in each of the three months:

Initial cards: 20
First month: 60
Second month: 40
Third month: 200

"To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we first need to calculate the number of sentences he edits for each publisher and then calculate the earnings from each publisher.

Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B each week.

Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, Mark earns:
500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 10 cents per sentence. For 500 sentences, Mark earns:
500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

Adding the earnings from both publishers, we get:
2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

Therefore, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week.

"To find out how many kilometers Michael rode in total, we can break the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the following three weeks.

For the first four weeks:
- Michael rides his bike 5 times a week.
- Each ride is 25 kilometers.
- So, in one week, he rides 5 * 25 = 125 kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rides 4 * 125 = 500 kilometers.

For the next three weeks:
- Michael rides his bike 2 times a week.
- Each ride is 60 kilometers.
- So, in one week, he rides 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rides 3 * 120 = 360 kilometers.

Adding the kilometers from both periods together:
- Total kilometers = 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40g. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars * 40g/chocolate bar = 1000g

Next, we are told that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. Therefore, the weight of each candied apple is:
40g / 2 = 20g

Since there are 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 candied apples * 20g/candied apple = 1600g

Now, we can find the total weight of the bag by adding the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples:
1000g (chocolate bars) + 1600g (candied apples) = 2600g

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600 grams.

"To find out how many cakes Rose bought after all three days, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
2. On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. So, she bought \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.
3. On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, she bought \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

Now, to find the total number of cakes she bought over the three days, we add the number of cakes from each day:

\[4 + 12 + 60 = 76\]

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is:

76"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, and half a dozen is 6 plates, the total cost for the plates is:
\[ 6 \times 6000 = 36000 \]

Next, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of these plates. So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:
\[ 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of one cup. Since twenty dozen cups are equivalent to 240 cups (because one dozen equals 12), we divide the total cost of the cups by the number of cups:
\[ \frac{34800}{240} = 145 \]

Therefore, the total cost of buying each cup is:
145"
"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:
2 pairs * $20/pair = $40

The total cost for the jacket and shoes is:
$30 (jacket) + $40 (shoes) = $70

Sara already has $10 saved, so the remaining amount she needs to save is:
$70 (total cost) - $10 (already saved) = $60

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so her earnings from babysitting are:
4 times * $5/time = $20

Adding her babysitting earnings to her savings, she has:
$10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting earnings) = $30

The remaining amount she needs to save after babysitting is:
$60 (remaining cost) - $30 (total savings after babysitting) = $30

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to save the remaining $30, we divide the remaining amount by her earnings per lawn mowed:
$30 / $4/lawn = 7.5

Since Sara cannot mow a half lawn, she will need to mow the lawn 8 times to have enough money to cover the remaining cost.

"To solve this problem, let's set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let \( r \) represent the number of red chickens and \( w \) represent the number of white chickens.

From the problem, we know:
1. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day.
2. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
3. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens.

We can write the following equations based on this information:
1. The total number of eggs collected each day: \( 3r + 5w = 42 \)
2. The relationship between the number of red and white chickens: \( w = r + 2 \)

Now, substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( r \):

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Distribute the 5:

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 8r = 32 \]

Divide both sides by 8:

\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a certain distance \( d \) at a constant speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substitute the perimeter for \( d \) and Gary's walking speed for \( v \):

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park.

"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the first day: 100 customers.
2. Calculate the number of customers on the second day: 100 customers (from the first day) + 50 more customers = 150 customers.
3. Calculate the total number of customers over the three days: 500 customers.
4. Subtract the number of customers from the first two days from the total to find the number of customers on the third day: 500 customers (total) - 100 customers (first day) - 150 customers (second day).

Now, let's do the math:

500 - 100 - 150 = 250

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( B \) be the amount of water in the big pool now, and \( S \) be the amount of water in the small pool now. Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool was \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons, and the amount of water in the small pool was \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

First, substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase. The cost of the shoes is $320.00 and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00, given that she earns $8.00 per hour. We do this by dividing the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ 352.00 \div 8.00 = 44 \]

So, Lori will need to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

"To determine Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months of payments, we first need to calculate the total amount she owes, including the 10% interest.

1. Calculate the total amount to be repaid:
   - Principal amount: $2000
   - Interest: 10% of $2000 = 0.10 * $2000 = $200
   - Total amount to be repaid: $2000 + $200 = $2200

2. Calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months:
   - Monthly payment: $165
   - Total payments over 12 months: $165 * 12 = $1980

3. Calculate the remaining balance after 12 months:
   - Total amount to be repaid: $2200
   - Total amount paid: $1980
   - Remaining balance: $2200 - $1980 = $220

"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we first need to determine the number of dahlias. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, and there are 4 roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, to find the total number of flowers in the vase, we add the number of roses to the number of dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining the current ages of Adrian and Zack based on Harriet's current age.

1. Harriet's current age is given as 21 years.
2. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age is twice Harriet's age:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
   \]

Next, we need to calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\)
- Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\)
- Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\)

Now, we calculate the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, let's break down the information given:

1. The total points scored by the four students is 251.
2. Naomi scored 68 points.
3. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
4. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.

First, calculate how many points Yuri scored:
- Half of Naomi's points: \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \)
- Yuri's points: \( 34 + 10 = 44 \)

Next, calculate how many points Brianna scored:
- Brianna's points: \( 68 + 17 = 85 \)

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
- Naomi: 68 points
- Yuri: 44 points
- Brianna: 85 points

To find out how many points Jojo scored, subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
- Total points scored by the three: \( 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \)
- Points scored by Jojo: \( 251 - 197 = 54 \)

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points.

"To find out how much time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on each type of puzzle and then add them together.

For the crossword puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- So, the time spent on crossword puzzles is 10 minutes/puzzle * 3 puzzles = 30 minutes.

For the sudoku puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.
- So, the time spent on sudoku puzzles is 5 minutes/puzzle * 8 puzzles = 40 minutes.

Now, we add the time spent on both types of puzzles:
- Total time spent = time spent on crossword puzzles + time spent on sudoku puzzles
- Total time spent = 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes.

Therefore, Carmen spent 70 minutes playing these games over the weekend.

2. Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank, so the amount of water left in the tank is:
   \[ 120 \text{ liters} - 90 \text{ liters} = 30 \text{ liters} \]

3. Celine then collected rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. The amount of rainwater collected is:
   \[ 2 \times 30 \text{ liters} = 60 \text{ liters} \]

4. The total amount of water in the tank now is the sum of the water left after Celine used some and the rainwater collected:

"To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type after James loses some and buys others, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cards James has initially.
2. Adjust the numbers for the cards lost and bought.
3. Calculate the new total number of cards.
4. Determine the probability of picking a water type card.
5. Convert the probability to a percentage and round to the nearest integer.

Let's start with the initial counts:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20
- Water type: 40

Total initial cards: 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

After losing 8 water type cards and buying 14 grass type cards:
- New number of water type cards: 40 - 8 = 32
- New number of grass type cards: 20 + 14 = 34

New total number of cards: 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96

The probability of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{32}{96} \]

To convert this probability to a percentage:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the initial pens Ram buys and the additional pens he can create by mixing the ink from the empty ones.

1. Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. After using these 25 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen. So, from the 25 empty pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.
3. After using these 5 new pens, he will have 5 more empty pens, which he can again mix to make 1 more pen.
4. After using this 1 pen, he will have 1 more empty pen, but he won't have enough to make another pen since he needs 5 empty pens to make one new pen.

"To determine how many hours Mike spends writing letters each week, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pen pals Mike is currently writing to:**
   - Mike originally had 5 pen pals.
   - He stopped writing to 2 of them.
   - Therefore, he is now writing to \(5 - 2 = 3\) pen pals.

2. **Determine the number of letters Mike receives and sends each week:**
   - Each of the 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week.
   - Therefore, Mike receives \(3 \times 2 = 6\) letters a week.
   - Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week.

3. **Calculate the total number of pages Mike writes each week:**
   - Each letter is 5 pages long.
   - Therefore, the total number of pages Mike writes each week is \(6 \times 5 = 30\) pages.

4. **Determine the time Mike spends writing each page:**
   - Mike can write a page every 6 minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time Mike spends writing each week:**
   - The total time spent writing 30 pages is \(30 \times 6 = 180\) minutes.

6. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the total time in hours is \(\frac{180}{60} = 3\) hours.

So, Mike spends 3 hours writing letters each week.

"To determine how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we need to calculate the total minutes he has used and subtract that from his monthly allowance.

1. **Daily calls with the boss**: Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day. Over 30 days, this amounts to:
   \[
   15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Extra calls**: Jason has also used 300 extra minutes for calls to other people.

3. **Total minutes used**: Adding the minutes used for daily calls and extra calls:
   \[
   450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Minutes remaining**: Jason's phone plan allows for 1000 minutes per month. Subtracting the total minutes used from the monthly allowance:
   \[
   1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, Jason has 250 minutes left on his phone plan.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries from Griffin, so Griffin has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. So, Griffin now has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took, which is \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. So, Griffin now has \(9 - 2 = 7\) fries left.
5. Ginger gives Griffin some fries, and in the end, Griffin has 27 fries.

Let \(x\) be the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin. We can set up the equation:

\[7 + x = 27\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[x = 27 - 7\]
\[x = 20\]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's start by identifying the key information and setting up the equation.

1. There are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium.
2. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.
3. This difference (28 snails) is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.
4. Let \( f \) represent the number of fish in each aquarium. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2f \).

According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2f \]
\[ 28 = 4f \]

To find \( f \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ f = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To find out how much Jean paid for the makeup artist, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily cost of the makeup artist.
2. Calculate the weekly cost of the makeup artist.
3. Calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks.
4. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.

Step 1: Daily cost
The makeup artist charges $250 per hour and it takes 6 hours each day.
Daily cost = $250/hour * 6 hours = $1500

Step 2: Weekly cost
The makeup is needed 4 times a week.
Weekly cost = $1500/day * 4 days = $6000

Step 3: Total cost for 5 weeks
The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
Total cost = $6000/week * 5 weeks = $30,000

Step 4: Apply the 10% discount
The makeup artist gives a 10% discount.
Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000
Total cost after discount = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

Jean paid $27,000.

"To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we first need to calculate the number of cookies each of them ate on both days and then convert that into calories.

On Monday:
- Sue's sister ate 5 cookies.
- Sue ate 4 times as many as her sister, so Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday:
- Sue's sister ate 13 cookies.
- Sue ate twice as many as her sister, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days:
- Sue's sister: \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies.
- Sue: \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.

Next, we convert the number of cookies into calories. Since 1 cookie has 200 calories:
- Sue's sister consumed \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.
- Sue consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

Finally, to find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister:

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first determine how many times Anne went down the slide. 

Mitchel went down the slide 30 times. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find 30% of Mitchel's 30 slides, we calculate:

30% of 30 = 0.30 * 30 = 9

So, Anne went down the slide 9 times less than Mitchel. Therefore, the number of times Anne went down the slide is:

30 - 9 = 21

Now, Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4:

21 * 4 = 84

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, there are 10 stalls, each with 20 cows. So, the total number of cows initially is:
   \[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows per stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

2. Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. Since there are 20 stalls, the number of new cows added to each stall is:
   \[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows per stall} \]

3. After adding the new cows, the total number of cows in each stall is:
   \[ 20 \text{ original cows} + 2 \text{ new cows} = 22 \text{ cows per stall} \]

4. To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:

"To determine the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
3. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the original total weight to find the current weight of the tree.

First, we calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it. The tree is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. 

\[ \text{Total weight before termites} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} \]
\[ \text{Total weight before termites} = 20 \times 400 \]
\[ \text{Total weight before termites} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the weight of the wood that the termites ate, which is 30% of the total weight.

\[ \text{Weight of wood eaten by termites} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.30 \]
\[ \text{Weight of wood eaten by termites} = 2400 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the original total weight to find the current weight of the tree.

\[ \text{Current weight of the tree} = 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} \]
\[ \text{Current weight of the tree} = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the amount of flour required for each day and then sum these amounts.

1. Calculate the flour needed for 36 cookies:
   - Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies, we can set up a proportion to find out how much flour is needed for 36 cookies.
   - \( \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{36 \text{ cookies}} \)
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = \frac{2 \times 36}{12} = 6 \) cups of flour.

2. Calculate the flour needed for 30 cookies:
   - Similarly, for 30 cookies, we set up the proportion:
   - \( \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{y \text{ cups}}{30 \text{ cookies}} \)
   - Solving for \( y \), we get \( y = \frac{2 \times 30}{12} = 5 \) cups of flour.

3. Add the amounts of flour needed for both days:

"To find out how many cards had the letter D on them, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of cards with the letter A.
2. Calculate the number of remaining cards after the A cards are taken out.
3. Calculate the number of cards with the letter B from the remaining cards.
4. Calculate the number of remaining cards after the B cards are taken out.
5. Calculate the number of cards with the letter C from the remaining cards.
6. The rest of the cards will have the letter D.

Let's start with step 1:

1. Number of cards with the letter A: \( \frac{2}{5} \) of 80 cards.
   \[ \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

2. Number of remaining cards after A cards are taken out:
   \[ 80 - 32 = 48 \]

3. Number of cards with the letter B: \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the remaining 48 cards.
   \[ \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

4. Number of remaining cards after B cards are taken out:
   \[ 48 - 24 = 24 \]

5. Number of cards with the letter C: \( \frac{5}{8} \) of the remaining 24 cards.

"To find out how many hours it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the total time for each type of hole and then sum them up.

First, calculate the time for the small holes:
- It takes Matthew 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
- For 30 small holes, it will take \(30 \times 3 = 90\) minutes.

Next, calculate the time for the large holes:
- It takes Matthew 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
- For 15 large holes, it will take \(15 \times 10 = 150\) minutes.

Now, add the time for both types of holes:
- Total time in minutes: \(90 + 150 = 240\) minutes.

Convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- There are 60 minutes in an hour, so \(240 \div 60 = 4\) hours.

"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we start with the sum of their current ages, which is 20. In 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older. Therefore, we add 10 years to each of their current ages, which is equivalent to adding 20 years to the sum of their current ages.

So, the calculation is:
20 (current sum of their ages) + 20 (10 years for each person) = 40

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40.

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \)
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of spots on a mamba:**
   - A cobra has 70 spots and has twice as many spots as a mamba.
   - Therefore, a mamba has \( \frac{70}{2} = 35 \) spots.

2. **Calculate the total number of spots for all cobras:**
   - There are 40 cobras, and each cobra has 70 spots.
   - Total spots for cobras = \( 40 \times 70 = 2800 \) spots.

3. **Calculate the total number of spots for all mambas:**
   - There are 60 mambas, and each mamba has 35 spots.
   - Total spots for mambas = \( 60 \times 35 = 2100 \) spots.

4. **Calculate the combined total number of spots:**
   - Total spots for all snakes = Total spots for cobras + Total spots for mambas
   - Total spots for all snakes = \( 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \) spots.

5. **Find half the number of spots they all have combined:**
   - Half of the total spots = \( \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \).

"To determine how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we first need to calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones and then find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads.

1. **Calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones:**
   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
   - Total length of topaz gemstones = 8 gemstones * 1 inch/gemstone = 8 inches.

2. **Determine the remaining length for the sterling silver beads:**
   - The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
   - Length occupied by topaz gemstones is 8 inches.
   - Remaining length for sterling silver beads = 25 inches - 8 inches = 17 inches.

3. **Calculate the number of sterling silver beads:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long.

"To find out how many rows of 5 stars there are on the flag, we can start by calculating the total number of stars in the rows that are not 5-star rows.

There are three rows of 8 stars each, so:
3 rows * 8 stars/row = 24 stars

There are two rows of 6 stars each, so:
2 rows * 6 stars/row = 12 stars

Now, we can add the stars from the 8-star rows and the 6-star rows to find the total number of stars that are not in the 5-star rows:
24 stars + 12 stars = 36 stars

The flag has 76 stars in total, so the number of stars in the 5-star rows is:
76 stars - 36 stars = 40 stars

Since each of the 5-star rows contains 5 stars, the number of 5-star rows is:
40 stars / 5 stars/row = 8 rows

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip, we first need to calculate the total weight of the 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight is:

80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to carry this total weight, given that each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds. We divide the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks

Since you can't have a fraction of a truck, and the result is a whole number, exactly 3 trucks are needed to transport all 80 flagstones in one trip.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane and then use that speed to calculate the time it took to cover 480 miles.

1. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour.
2. The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles/hour.
3. To find the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover 480 miles, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]
4. Substituting the known values:

"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars. There are 8 packets, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, so:

\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars/packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we need to determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get in total. There are 4 adults, and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars/adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, and these 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them, so each child will get:

"Let's break down the points each player has after the third round and then calculate the points after the fourth round.

After 3 rounds:
- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

In the fourth round, each player with over 20 points gets an extra point:
- Mike has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point and remains at 18 points.
- Tony has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points for all three players after the fourth round:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much weight Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can calculate the weekly weight loss for Joey as follows:

8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Now, we know that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will also lose 2 pounds, but it will take her 4 weeks to do so.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same 8 pounds that Joey loses in 4 weeks, we can set up the following proportion:

If 2 pounds are lost in 4 weeks for Sandy, then 8 pounds will be lost in \( x \) weeks.

We can set up the equation:

2 pounds / 4 weeks = 8 pounds / \( x \) weeks

Solving for \( x \):

\( x \) = (8 pounds * 4 weeks) / 2 pounds
\( x \) = 32 / 2
\( x \) = 16 weeks

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

Subtracting the expenses from the amount he plans to spend:
$4000 - $1950 = $2050

Therefore, Theo has $2050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners.

"To find out how many eggs the family consumes in a week, we first need to calculate the daily egg consumption and then multiply that by 7 days.

There are 3 people who eat 3 eggs each day, and 2 people who eat 2 eggs each day.

The 3 people will eat a total of:
3 people * 3 eggs/person = 9 eggs

The 2 people will eat a total of:
2 people * 2 eggs/person = 4 eggs

The total daily consumption is:
9 eggs + 4 eggs = 13 eggs

Now, to find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 days:
13 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 91 eggs/week

So, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week.

"To find out how old Trent is, we can start by determining Jane's age based on Quinn's age. Since Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, and Quinn is 30, we can calculate Jane's age as follows:

Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3
Jane's age = 30 - 3
Jane's age = 27

Now that we know Jane is 27 years old, we can find out how old Trent is. Since Trent is 5 years older than Jane:

Trent's age = Jane's age + 5
Trent's age = 27 + 5
Trent's age = 32

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, Noah is now \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile was \(3000 \times 20 = 60,000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Therefore, the current population of Chile is \(60,000 \times 2 = 120,000\).

The population of Chile now is 120,000."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \). According to the problem, the number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the offense has \( 2D \) players. The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the special teams have \( \frac{D}{2} \) players.

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[ 6D + D = 210 \]

\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, solve for \( D \):

\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]

\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

"To find out how many people show up for Martha's party, let's break down the information step by step:

1. Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each, which totals:
   \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people.

2. She also invited 3 families with 4 people each, which totals:
   \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people.

3. Adding these together, the total number of people invited is:
   \(12 + 12 = 24\) people.

4. 8 people couldn't come due to illness, so we subtract these from the total:
   \(24 - 8 = 16\) people.

5. 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. This means:
   \(8 \times \frac{1}{4} = 2\) people.

6. Subtracting these 2 people from the 16 who were still expected to come:
   \(16 - 2 = 14\) people.

Therefore, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is 14.

"To find the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has after buying from Johanna and receiving more from his father.
2. Multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble to find the total weight.

First, let's calculate the total number of marbles:

- Solomon initially had 50 marbles.
- He bought 20 more marbles from Johanna, so he now has 50 + 20 = 70 marbles.
- His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since he bought 20 marbles, his father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \) marbles.
- Adding the marbles from his father, Solomon now has 70 + 8 = 78 marbles.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the marbles:

- Each marble weighs 2 kg.
- Therefore, the total weight of 78 marbles is \( 78 \times 2 = 156 \) kg.

The total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is 156 kg.

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular pool is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 5 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

"To solve this problem, we need to use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.

Given that the total number of electric wires is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles:

1 pole / 3 wires = x poles / 45 wires

To find x (the number of poles), we can cross-multiply and solve for x:

1 * 45 = 3 * x
45 = 3x
x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to calculate the total amount of liquid added to the coffee, which includes both the ice cubes and the cream.

First, we calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we divide 65 by 13:

\[ \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65}{13} = 5 \]

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Additionally, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. Therefore, the total amount by which the coffee is weakened is:

1. **Determine the number of junior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees.
   - Number of junior programmers = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \).

2. **Determine the number of senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of senior programmers = Total employees - Number of junior programmers.
   - Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60.

3. **Determine the monthly salary of senior programmers:**
   - Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month.
   - Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers.
   - Monthly salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400 = $2400.

4. **Calculate the total monthly salary for junior programmers:**
   - Number of junior programmers = 40.
   - Monthly salary of each junior programmer = $2000.
   - Total monthly salary for junior programmers = 40 \times $2000 = $80,000.

5. **Calculate the total monthly salary for senior programmers:**
   - Number of senior programmers = 60.
   - Monthly salary of each senior programmer = $2400.
   - Total monthly salary for senior programmers = 60 \times $2400 = $144,000.

6. **Calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month:**

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many people got on the bus at the terminal.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.
2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the number of people on the bus is now \( x + 5 \).
3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 people got on. Therefore, the number of people on the bus is now \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

Simplifying the expression:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We know that after the second stop, there were 20 people on the bus:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to calculate the remaining percentage of charge required:

100% - 60% = 40%

The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes. Therefore, to charge 40 percentage-points, it will take:

40 percentage-points * 3 minutes/percentage-point = 120 minutes

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

120 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours

Thus, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%.

Add 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group, therefore, has:

"To solve this problem, let's start by setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( C \) represent the number of cows and \( H \) represent the number of chickens. According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of animals is 60.
2. There are twice as many chickens as cows.

We can express these as:
\[ C + H = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

Now, substitute \( H = 2C \) into the first equation:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, there are 20 cows. Since \( H = 2C \):
\[ H = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each.

The total number of legs from the cows is:
\[ 20 \times 4 = 80 \]

The total number of legs from the chickens is:
\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:

- Jenny's son gets 4 cookies a day for 5 days, which totals to \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.
- Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, which totals to \(1 \times 7 = 7\) cookies.

The total number of cookies eaten by her son and husband is \(20 + 7 = 27\) cookies.

Since the bag contains 36 cookies, the number of cookies left for Jenny is \(36 - 27 = 9\) cookies.

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies.

"To find out how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts with a 40% discount, we first need to calculate the total cost of the shirts without the discount. Each shirt costs $30, so for 2 shirts, the total cost is:

2 shirts * $30/shirt = $60

Next, we calculate the discount amount. A 40% discount on $60 is:

40% of $60 = 0.40 * $60 = $24

Now, we subtract the discount from the original total cost to find out how much Davos paid:

$60 - $24 = $36

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

"To calculate the total amount of money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to break down the costs and then sum them up.

1. **Food cost per month**: Since food costs $25 per week and there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly cost for food is:
   \[ 25 \times 4 = 100 \text{ dollars per month} \]

2. **Treats cost per month**: Treats cost $20 per month.

3. **Medicine cost per month**: Medicine costs $100 per month.

4. **Total monthly cost**: Adding up the monthly costs for food, treats, and medicine:

"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of plant pots she donates and then subtract that from the number of plant pots she originally bought.

1. The school asks for 30 plant pots for the daisies.
2. They ask for twice as many for the roses, which means 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots for the roses.
3. The total number of plant pots needed is 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90 plant pots.
4. April originally bought 100 plant pots.
5. The number of plant pots left over is 100 (original) - 90 (donated) = 10 plant pots.

"To find out how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to first determine the total time he spent on his vacation. We know that the time he spent watching shows (3 shows at 2 hours each) is 30% of his total vacation time.

First, let's calculate the total time he spent watching shows:
3 shows * 2 hours/show = 6 hours

Since this is 30% of his total vacation time, we can set up the equation:
6 hours = 0.30 * Total Vacation Time

To find the Total Vacation Time, we divide both sides by 0.30:
Total Vacation Time = 6 hours / 0.30
Total Vacation Time = 20 hours

Now that we know the total vacation time, we can calculate the time he spent sightseeing, which is 40% of his total vacation time:
Sightseeing Time = 0.40 * Total Vacation Time
Sightseeing Time = 0.40 * 20 hours
Sightseeing Time = 8 hours

So, John spent 8 hours sightseeing.

"To determine how much more money Annabelle needs to save, we first calculate her total earnings from both jobs and then add this to her current savings. Finally, we subtract this total from the cost of the phone.

1. Calculate earnings from the first job:
   - Earnings from the first job = $10/hour * 20 hours = $200

2. Calculate earnings from the second job:
   - Earnings from the second job = $5/hour * 15 hours = $75

3. Calculate total earnings from both jobs:
   - Total earnings = $200 + $75 = $275

4. Calculate total savings after adding earnings to current savings:
   - Total savings = $80 (current savings) + $275 (total earnings) = $355

5. Calculate how much more money is needed to buy the phone:
   - Amount needed = $400 (cost of the phone) - $355 (total savings) = $45

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save $45.

"To find the height of the tallest tree, let's first determine the heights of the other two trees.

The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet.

The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so its height is:
6 feet + 5 feet = 11 feet

The combined height of the shortest and the second tree is:
6 feet + 11 feet = 17 feet

The tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree, so its height is:
2 * 17 feet = 34 feet

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is 34 feet.

"To find out how much money Marisa puts in her piggy bank over 5 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Marisa receives in 5 days.
2. Calculate the total amount of money Marisa spends on lollipops in 5 days.
3. Subtract the total amount spent on lollipops from the total amount received to find out how much she saves.

Step 1: Total amount received in 5 days
Marisa receives $5 every day. Over 5 days, she receives:
\[ 5 \text{ days} \times \$5/\text{day} = \$25 \]

Step 2: Total amount spent on lollipops in 5 days
Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and Marisa buys 4 lollipops every day. The cost of lollipops per day is:
\[ 4 \text{ lollipops/day} \times \$0.25/\text{lollipop} = \$1 \]
Over 5 days, the total cost of lollipops is:
\[ 5 \text{ days} \times \$1/\text{day} = \$5 \]

Step 3: Calculate the savings
The total amount saved is the total amount received minus the total amount spent on lollipops:
\[ \$25 - \$5 = \$20 \]

Therefore, Marisa puts \$20 in her piggy bank over 5 days.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the gumballs:**
   Billy bought 40 gumballs, and each gumball costs $0.05.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of gumballs} = 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the amount of change Billy had before buying gumballs:**
   Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the total change he had before buying gumballs must be twice the cost of the gumballs.
   \[
   \text{Total change before buying gumballs} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine how much money Billy spent on candy:**
   Billy started with $10 and had $4 left as change after buying candy.
   \[
   \text{Money spent on candy} = 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of pounds of candy Billy bought:**
   The candy costs $1.50 per pound.
   \[
   \text{Number of pounds of candy} = \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \text{ pounds}
   \]

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \).

According to the problem, Carver is 5 years less than twice his son's age. This can be written as:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the distance between the third city and the first city:**
   - The combined distance from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city is \(75 + 100 = 175\) miles.
   - The distance from the third city to the first city is \(175 - 50 = 125\) miles.

2. **Calculate the total distance for one complete trip:**
   - The total distance for one complete trip (first city to second city, second city to third city, and third city back to the first city) is \(75 + 100 + 125 = 300\) miles.

3. **Calculate the total distance traveled in one day:**
   - The train makes this trip 3 times a day, so the total distance traveled in one day is \(300 \times 3 = 900\) miles.

4. **Determine how many days the train can go before needing service:**
   - The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it can go before needing service, we divide the total service distance by the daily distance traveled:
   \[
   \frac{18,000 \text{ miles}}{900 \text{ miles/day}} = 20 \text{ days}
   \]

Therefore, the train goes 20 days between services.

"To determine how many pounds of stuffing Mark needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed:**
   - A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing.
   - A chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing.
   - The amount of stuffing for a collie bed is the average of the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds.
   - Average = (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds of stuffing.

2. **Calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:**
   - Each chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing.
   - Total for 4 chihuahua beds = 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing.

3. **Calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:**
   - Each collie bed takes 5 pounds of stuffing.
   - Total for 3 collie beds = 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

4. **Calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for all the beds:**
   - Total stuffing = stuffing for chihuahua beds + stuffing for collie beds
   - Total stuffing = 8 + 15 = 23 pounds of stuffing.

Therefore, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

"To find out how many fourth-grade boys were at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of fourth-grade boys at the school.
2. Subtract the number of boys who were absent on Friday from the total number of boys.

First, we know there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is:

96 (total students) - 43 (girls) = 53 boys

Next, we know that 4 boys were absent on Friday. So, the number of boys present on Friday is:

53 (total boys) - 4 (absent boys) = 49 boys

Therefore, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 49.

3. **Physical Violence**: The number of people kicked out for physical violence is three times the number of shoplifters. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Physical Violence} = 3 \times 7 = 21
   \]

Now, let's sum up the total number of people kicked out for these reasons:
\[
\text{Total for masks, shoplifting, and physical violence} = 3 + 7 + 21 = 31
\]

The total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is 50. Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:

"To determine the monthly payment Karan has to make, we first need to calculate the total interest on the loan and then the total amount to be repaid, which includes both the principal and the interest. After that, we can divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment.

1. **Calculate the interest:**
   The formula for simple interest is:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   Here, the principal (P) is $3,650, the rate (R) is 10% or 0.10, and the time (T) is 5 months, which is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of a year.

   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 = 152.08
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} = 3650 + 152.08 = 3802.08
   \]

3. **Calculate the monthly payment:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}} = \frac{3802.08}{5} = 760.42

   - Each pitcher holds 12 cups.
   - Total cups = 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups.

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade:**
   - She sells each cup for $1.
   - Total revenue = 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

3. **Calculate the total profit:**
   - Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost.
   - Total cost = $18 (cost of supplies).
   - Total profit = $36 - $18 = $18.

4. **Determine the total number of hours Millie spends running the lemonade stand:**
   - She sells an average of 4 cups per hour.
   - Total hours = Total cups / Cups per hour = 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

5. **Calculate the profit per hour:**
   - Profit per hour = Total profit / Total hours = $18 / 9 hours = $2/hour.

Therefore, Millie's profit per hour is $2.

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up the problem as follows:

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially. According to the problem, he sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, let's calculate the value of \( x \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of boys and girls in the choir:**
   - The choir has 52 members, with 50% boys and 50% girls.
   - Number of boys = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26
   - Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26

2. **Determine the number of girls performing:**
   - The performance is with just the female members, so all 26 girls are initially set to perform.

3. **Account for the bus breakdown:**
   - Half of the people performing can't make it to the show.
   - Number of girls who can't make it = 0.5 * 26 = 13
   - Number of girls who can make it = 26 - 13 = 13

4. **Include the teachers:**
   - The choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with the girls.
   - Total number of people singing = Number of girls who can make it + Number of teachers
   - Total number of people singing = 13 + 3 = 16

Therefore, the number of people who sang in the performance is:

"To determine how much money David saves by buying a ride bracelet instead of individual ride tickets, we need to calculate the total cost for both David and Dasha and then compare them.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Dasha, who buys individual ride tickets:
- Each ride costs 2 ride tickets.
- Each ride ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, each ride costs 2 * $2 = $4.
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is 9 * $4 = $36.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for David, who buys a ride bracelet:
- The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives access to all 9 rides.

Now, we compare the costs:
- Dasha's total cost: $36
- David's total cost: $30

The amount David saves is the difference between Dasha's total cost and David's total cost:
$36 - $30 = $6

"To solve this problem, we first need to understand the ratio and the total number of popsicles. The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6, which means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. Together, they have a total of 165 popsicles.

First, we need to find out how many parts the total number of popsicles is divided into according to the ratio. The total parts are 5 (Betty's share) + 6 (Sam's share) = 11 parts.

Next, we determine how many popsicles each part represents by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \text{Number of popsicles per part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find out how many popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"To determine how much money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to streaming services, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services and then subtract this from the cost of the cable package.

1. **Cost of Netflix**: $10 per month.
2. **Cost of Hulu and Disney Plus**:
   - Normally, each service costs $10 per month.
   - The total cost for both services without the discount is $10 + $10 = $20 per month.
   - With a 20% discount, the savings on the bundle is 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4.
   - Therefore, the discounted cost for the bundle is $20 - $4 = $16 per month.

3. **Total cost of streaming services**:
   - Netflix: $10
   - Hulu and Disney Plus bundle: $16
   - Total: $10 + $16 = $26 per month.

4. **Savings**:
   - Cost of cable package: $60 per month.
   - Cost of streaming services: $26 per month.
   - Savings: $60 - $26 = $34 per month.

Therefore, Tim saves $34 per month by cancelling his cable package and switching to streaming services.

"To find the percentage of time Carol spent editing her song, we first need to calculate the total time she spent on all activities and then determine what portion of that time was spent editing.

1. Time spent writing the song: 4 hours
2. Time spent recording the song: 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
3. Time spent editing the song: 90 minutes, which is 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours

Next, we add up all the time spent on the activities to get the total work time:
Total work time = 4 hours (writing) + 2 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7.5 hours

Now, we calculate the percentage of the total work time that was spent editing:
Percentage of time spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total work time) * 100
Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 hours / 7.5 hours) * 100 = 20%

Therefore, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing the song.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The pizza has 12 slices in total.
2. Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since 1/3 of 12 is 4, Bill gets 4 slices.
3. Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. Since 1/4 of 12 is 3, Mark gets 3 slices.
4. Jenny eats 2 slices herself.

Now, let's calculate the total number of slices given away and eaten:
- Slices given to Bill: 4
- Slices given to Mark: 3
- Slices eaten by Jenny: 2

Total slices given away and eaten: 4 + 3 + 2 = 9

Finally, we subtract the total slices given away and eaten from the original number of slices:

"To determine how many kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days by reducing the time he uses the air conditioner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily energy usage of the air conditioner:
   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour.
   - Mel uses it for 8 hours a day.
   - Daily energy usage = 900 watts/hour * 8 hours/day = 7200 watts/day.

2. Convert the daily energy usage to kilowatts:
   - 1 kilowatt (kW) = 1000 watts.
   - Daily energy usage in kilowatts = 7200 watts/day / 1000 = 7.2 kW/day.

3. Calculate the energy usage reduction per day:
   - Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day.
   - Energy saved per day = 900 watts/hour * 5 hours/day = 4500 watts/day.
   - Energy saved per day in kilowatts = 4500 watts/day / 1000 = 4.5 kW/day.

"To determine how much Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we first need to calculate the number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people served per sandwich:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches, Tyson will need:

5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, and the cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound. So, the total cost for the meat and cheese is:

5 pounds of meat * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
5 pounds of cheese * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

Adding the cost of the meat and the cheese together gives us the total cost:

"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he has taken 5,000 steps. Additionally, he did another 1,000 steps on a short walk with his friend. This brings the total number of steps he has taken so far to 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After his jog, he has 2,000 steps left to reach his goal. This means that before the jog, he had 2,000 steps left plus the steps he took during the jog. Since he had 4,000 steps left before the jog (10,000 - 6,000), and he only had 2,000 steps left after the jog, he must have taken 4,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 steps during his jog.

2. Determine the number of employees who continued working in June.
3. Calculate the total payment for June.
4. Sum the payments for May and June.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**

- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per week: 40
- Weeks in a month: 4 (assuming a standard 4-week month for simplicity)

Total payment for one employee in May:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Total payment for all employees in May:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 40 \, \text{employees} = 96000 \, \text{dollars} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of employees who continued working in June.**

- 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees continued working.
- Number of employees who continued working in June:
\[ 40 \, \text{employees} \times \frac{3}{4} = 30 \, \text{employees} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for June.**

Total payment for one employee in June:

"To find out how much Tim spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks after the discount and then add the cost of the finale firework.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the two packages of fireworks before the discount:
- The first package costs $400.
- The second package costs twice as much as the first, so it costs $400 * 2 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages before the discount is:
$400 + $800 = $1200.

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the two packages:
- A 20% discount means he pays 80% of the total cost.
- 80% of $1200 is $1200 * 0.80 = $960.

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted total:
$960 + $150 = $1110.

Therefore, Tim spent a total of $1110 on fireworks.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 180.
2. The total number of humps is 304.

We can write these as two equations:
1. \( C + D = 180 \) (each animal has one head)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \) (camels have 2 humps, dromedaries have 1 hump)

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of \( C \) and \( D \).

First, we can solve the first equation for \( D \):
\[ D = 180 - C \]

Next, we substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[ 2C + (180 - C) = 304 \]
\[ 2C + 180 - C = 304 \]
\[ C + 180 = 304 \]
\[ C = 304 - 180 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we have \( C \), we can find \( D \) using the first equation:
\[ D = 180 - C \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is 56.

"To calculate the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we can break down the trip into segments and sum the distances.

1. For the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day:
   \( 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \)

2. Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled over the first four days:
   \( 30\% \times 800 \, \text{km} = 0.30 \times 800 \, \text{km} = 240 \, \text{km} \)

3. On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance for that day is:
   \( 0 \, \text{km} \)

4. During the second week (7 days), he traveled 300 kilometers each day:
   \( 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \)

Now, we sum up all the distances:
\( 800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} = 3140 \, \text{km} \)

The total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:

"To find out how big Timothy's locker is, we can start by determining the size of Zack's locker based on the information given about Peter's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Peter's locker size} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Zack's locker size} \]

Given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can solve for Zack's locker size:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Zack's locker size} \]

Multiplying both sides by 4 to solve for Zack's locker size:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Now, we know that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so we can set up another equation:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Timothy's locker size} \]

Substituting the value we found for Zack's locker size:

\[ 20 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Timothy's locker size} \]

Multiplying both sides by 2 to solve for Timothy's locker size:

\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the elevation where the comb landed.
2. Calculate the difference between Oliver's current elevation and the comb's elevation.

First, we know that Stanley was at an elevation of 10,000 feet and the comb fell 4,000 feet. Therefore, the comb landed at:
\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:
\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the comb.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, there are 50 cats on the rock.
2. Four boats came and each carried away 5 cats. So, the total number of cats carried away by the boats is 4 * 5 = 20 cats.
3. After the boats have left, the number of cats remaining on the rock is 50 - 20 = 30 cats.
4. Then, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. The number of cats that ran after the mouse is (3/5) * 30 = 18 cats.
5. The number of cats left on the rock after some ran after the mouse is 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

"To calculate the total cost of the streaming service for 2 years, we need to break down the costs into the different periods and then sum them up.

1. **First 6 months at $8 per month:**
   6 months * $8/month = $48

2. **Next 8 months at $12 per month:**
   8 months * $12/month = $96

3. **Remaining 10 months at $14 per month:**
   2 years = 24 months
   24 months - 6 months (first period) - 8 months (second period) = 10 months
   10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, we add up all the costs:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars, came from the tattered jeans.

4. **Determine the original prices of the jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans were bought for $28 and saved $4, so the original price of the tattered jeans was \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The jogger jeans were bought for $22 and saved $2, so the original price of the jogger jeans was \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:**
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans.

"To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner, let's break down the costs of each item she ordered:

1. **Bagel**: The cost of the bagel is given as $4.
2. **Soup**: The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find the cost of the soup:
   \[
   \text{Cost of soup} = \text{Cost of bagel} + 25\% \times \text{Cost of bagel}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of soup} = 4 + 0.25 \times 4 = 4 + 1 = 5
   \]
   So, the soup costs $5.
3. **Cake**: The cake costs half the price of the bagel. To find the cost of the cake:
   \[
   \text{Cost of cake} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of bagel} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2
   \]
   So, the cake costs $2.

Now, we add up the costs of all the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of bagel} + \text{Cost of soup} + \text{Cost of cake} = 4 + 5 + 2 = 11

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( C \).

Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards, so he sells 2/3 of his cards. The amount of money he makes from selling the cards is the number of cards he sells multiplied by the price per card, which is $1.5.

The money from selling the cards is:
\[ \text{Money from selling cards} = \left(\frac{2}{3}C\right) \times 1.5 \]

Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 left over, so the total amount of money he makes from selling the cards is $150. We can set up the equation:
\[ \left(\frac{2}{3}C\right) \times 1.5 = 150 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C = \frac{150}{1.5} \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C = 100 \]
\[ C = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} \]
\[ C = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The caterer was initially preparing for 36 guests.
2. He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. This means he prepared for 18 guests to have two hotdogs and the other 18 guests to have one hotdog.
3. The total number of hotdogs prepared is therefore:
   - 18 guests * 2 hotdogs each = 36 hotdogs
   - 18 guests * 1 hotdog each = 18 hotdogs
   - Total = 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs

4. However, 40 guests showed up, and each wanted a second hotdog. This means each of the 40 guests wanted 2 hotdogs.
5. The total number of hotdogs needed for 40 guests, each having 2 hotdogs, is:
   - 40 guests * 2 hotdogs each = 80 hotdogs

6. The caterer only had 54 hotdogs prepared, so the number of hotdogs short is:
   - 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs

7. Since each guest who did not get a second hotdog is missing 1 hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26.

"To find out how much Charlotte's order was after the 20% discount, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. 

The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.
The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
The cost of the 5 utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Adding these together, the total cost before the discount is:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Now, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost.

The amount she pays is 80% of $165.00, which is:
0.80 * $165.00 = $132.00.

So, the final cost of her order is $132.00.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the dimensions of the room in feet. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is given in yards. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

Now, we can use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:

Area = Length * Width

We can rearrange this formula to solve for the width:

Width = Area / Length

Substituting the known values:

Width = 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet

Now that we have both the length and the width of the room, we can calculate the perimeter. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)

Substituting the values we have:

Perimeter = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet) = 2 * 49 feet = 98 feet

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet.

"To determine the salesman's profit, we first need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue from the sales.

1. **Total Cost:**
   The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. Therefore, the cost per sneaker is:
   \[
   \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Revenue from Flash Sale:**
   He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each at the flash sale. The revenue from the flash sale is:
   \[
   \text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Revenue from Department Store:**
   The remaining sneakers (48 - 17 = 31) were sold to the department store for $25 each. The revenue from the department store is:
   \[
   \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Revenue:**
   The total revenue from all sales is:
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Profit Calculation:**
   The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of the Super Ticket**: $20
2. **Cost of the Movie Ticket**: $12
3. **Cost of the Soda**: $3
4. **Savings**: $2

If you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2, it means the total cost of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda was $2 less than the cost of the super ticket plus the extra $1 for the popcorn and soda.

Let's denote the regular price of the popcorn as \( P \).

The total cost of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda is:
\[ 12 + P + 3 \]

The cost of the super ticket plus the extra $1 for the popcorn and soda is:
\[ 20 + 1 = 21 \]

According to the problem, you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket:
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 21 - 2 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 19 \]
\[ 15 + P = 19 \]
\[ P = 19 - 15 \]
\[ P = 4 \]

So, the regular price of the popcorn is \( \boxed{4} \)."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the original cost per balloon before the price increase. We know that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of balloons}} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \]

So, the original cost per balloon was $45.

After the price increase, the cost per balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price:

\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times 65 = 11050 \]

Thus, Bentley paid $11,050 to fill 170 balloons after the price increase.

"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled at each speed:
- At 60 mph for 2 hours, the distance is \(60 \times 2 = 120\) miles.
- At 30 mph for 1 hour, the distance is \(30 \times 1 = 30\) miles.

The total distance traveled is \(120 + 30 = 150\) miles.

Next, we calculate the total time taken:
- The total time is \(2 + 1 = 3\) hours.

Now, we can find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ mph} \]

"To determine the cost of the potting soil for Bob, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of one raised bed.
2. Multiply the volume of one raised bed by the number of beds to get the total volume of soil needed.
3. Determine how many bags of potting soil are required.
4. Calculate the total cost based on the number of bags needed.

Step 1: Calculate the volume of one raised bed.
The volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is calculated by multiplying the length by the width by the height.
Volume of one bed = 2 feet (width) * 8 feet (length) * 2 feet (height) = 32 cubic feet.

Step 2: Calculate the total volume of soil needed for all 10 beds.
Total volume = 32 cubic feet/bed * 10 beds = 320 cubic feet.

Step 3: Determine how many bags of potting soil are required.
Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil.
Number of bags needed = Total volume / Volume per bag = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags.

Step 4: Calculate the total cost.
Each bag costs $12.
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag = 160 bags * $12/bag = $1920.

The total cost for the potting soil is $1920.

"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

Total number of puppies = Jennifer's puppies + Brandon's puppies
Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Total number of puppies with spots = Jennifer's spotted puppies + Brandon's spotted puppies
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, to find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of spotted puppies} = \left( \frac{\text{Total number of spotted puppies}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of spotted puppies} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of spotted puppies} = 0.35 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of spotted puppies} = 35\% \]

"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then the total weight of all the feed combined.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds

2. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds

3. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds

4. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, we add up the total weight of all the feed:

- Total weight = 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats)
- Total weight = 4500 pounds

The farmer's truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

- Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
- Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip
- Number of trips = 2

Since the result is a whole number, the farmer will need exactly 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the weekly earnings from both the aluminum cans and the plastic bottles, and then multiply by four.

First, let's calculate the weekly earnings:
- Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week, and each can is worth 2 cents. So, the weekly earnings from cans are 3 cans * 2 cents/can = 6 cents.
- Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week, and each bottle is worth 3 cents. So, the weekly earnings from bottles are 5 bottles * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents.

Now, let's add the weekly earnings from cans and bottles:
- Total weekly earnings = 6 cents (from cans) + 15 cents (from bottles) = 21 cents.

Finally, to find the earnings for a four-week month, we multiply the total weekly earnings by 4:
- Monthly earnings = 21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents.

"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to follow the information step by step.

First, we determine how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we calculate 60% of 10 and add it to 10 to find the total number of plants Toni has.

60% of 10 is calculated as:
0.60 * 10 = 6

So, Toni has:
10 + 6 = 16 plants

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. Since Toni has 16 plants, we subtract 7 from 16 to find the number of plants Shondra has.

16 - 7 = 9

Shondra has 9 plants.

"First, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has:

6 decks * 25 cards/deck = 150 basketball cards

Next, we calculate the total number of baseball cards:

5 boxes * 40 cards/box = 200 baseball cards

Now, we add the basketball and baseball cards to find the total number of cards:

150 basketball cards + 200 baseball cards = 350 cards

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so we subtract those from the total:

350 cards - 50 cards = 300 cards

These 300 cards are the ones she gives to her students. If each student gets 10 cards, we can find the number of students by dividing the number of cards given away by the number of cards each student receives:

300 cards / 10 cards/student = 30 students

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, calculate the total cost for Becky:
- Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each.
- The total cost before the discount is \( 20 \times 45 \) cents.
- Convert 45 cents to dollars: \( 45 \) cents = \( 0.45 \) dollars.
- So, the total cost before the discount is \( 20 \times 0.45 = 9 \) dollars.
- Becky received a $1 discount, so the final cost for Becky is \( 9 - 1 = 8 \) dollars.

Next, calculate the total cost for Kelly:
- Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each.
- The total cost before the discount is \( 20 \times 50 \) cents.
- Convert 50 cents to dollars: \( 50 \) cents = \( 0.50 \) dollars.
- So, the total cost before the discount is \( 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \) dollars.
- Kelly received a 10 percent discount, so the discount amount is \( 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \) dollar.
- The final cost for Kelly is \( 10 - 1 = 9 \) dollars.

Now, calculate how much more Kelly paid than Becky:
- Kelly paid \( 9 \) dollars.
- Becky paid \( 8 \) dollars.
- The difference is \( 9 - 8 = 1 \) dollar.

So, Kelly paid $1 more than Becky.

"To determine how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set the equation equal to 5:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint. Since Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, we calculate:
\[ \text{Jasper's yellow paint tubes} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

To find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we add the blue and yellow paint tubes together:
\[ \text{Total tubes of paint Jasper has} = 2 + 9 = 11 \]

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to determine the weight of the 2010 penny. Given that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight as follows:

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = 36 grains

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding the weight of the 2010 penny to the weight of the 1959 penny:

Combined weight = Weight of 2010 penny + Weight of 1959 penny
Combined weight = 36 grains + 48 grains
Combined weight = 84 grains

"To find out how much more Keegan and Tashay need to earn to reach their goal, we first add the amounts that Keegan and Tashay have already earned:

Keegan's earnings: $83
Tashay's earnings: $91

Total earnings so far: $83 + $91 = $174

Their goal is to raise $200. To find out how much more they need to earn, we subtract their total earnings from their goal:

$200 - $174 = $26

So, Keegan and Tashay need to earn $26 more to reach their goal.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Gabriel has 20 songs on his player.
2. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, which means Luri has \(3 \times 20 = 60\) songs on his player.
3. Both players can store up to 100 songs.

Now, let's calculate how many more songs each can add to their players:

- Gabriel can add \(100 - 20 = 80\) more songs.
- Luri can add \(100 - 60 = 40\) more songs.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number Gabriel can add:

- \(80 - 40 = 40\)

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can.

"To find out how much money Stetson gave up, we first need to calculate how many oranges he ate. Since Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges they picked, and they picked 60 oranges, we can calculate the number of oranges he ate as follows:

Number of oranges Stetson ate = (2/5) * 60

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money Stetson gave up by multiplying the number of oranges he ate by the $10 he gives up for each orange.

Total amount of money Stetson gave up = Number of oranges Stetson ate * $10

Let's do the math:

Number of oranges Stetson ate = (2/5) * 60 = 24

Total amount of money Stetson gave up = 24 * $10 = $240

"To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for five days, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the daily oats consumption for one horse:**
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, each horse consumes \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).

2. **Calculate the daily oats consumption for all four horses:**
   - There are 4 horses.
   - Each horse consumes 10 pounds of oats per day.
   - Therefore, the total daily consumption for all horses is \(4 \text{ horses} \times 10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).

3. **Calculate the total oats consumption for five days:**
   - The total daily consumption is 40 pounds.
   - Over 5 days, the total consumption is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).

4. **Determine the number of bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.
   - The total consumption is 200 pounds.
   - Therefore, the number of bags needed is \(\frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags}\).

So, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

"To find out how much Sally spends in all, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza and then add it to the cost of the small pizza.

The cost of the small pizza is $8. The family-size pizza costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, so we calculate the cost of the family-size pizza as follows:

Cost of family-size pizza = 3 * Cost of small pizza
Cost of family-size pizza = 3 * $8
Cost of family-size pizza = $24

Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount Sally spends:

Total cost = Cost of small pizza + Cost of family-size pizza

"To determine the cost per individual razor after all discounts, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Cost of Razors Before Discount:**
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - Heather buys 2 packs, so the total cost before any discounts is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$8.00
     \]

2. **Buy One Get One Free Discount:**
   - With the buy one get one free offer, Heather gets 2 packs for the price of 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is:
     \[
     \$4.00
     \]

3. **Applying the Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - Subtract the coupon from the cost of 2 packs:
     \[
     \$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00
     \]

4. **Total Number of Razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - Heather buys 2 packs, so the total number of razors is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors per pack} = 8 \text{ razors}
     \]

5. **Cost Per Razor:**
   - The total cost after the coupon is $2.00.
   - The cost per razor is:
     \[
     \frac{\$2.00}{8 \text{ razors}} = \$0.25 \text{ per razor}
     \]

6. **Convert to Cents:**
   - $0.25 is equivalent to 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor after all discounts is 25 cents.

"To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to add up the heights of the cheerleaders, starting from the bottom and moving to the top.

The pyramid structure is as follows:
- 4 cheerleaders on the bottom
- 3 cheerleaders on the next level
- 2 cheerleaders on the next level
- 1 cheerleader (the shortest) at the top

Given that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall and the 10th is 60 inches tall, the shortest girl, who is 60 inches tall, will be at the top.

The height of the pyramid is the sum of the heights of the cheerleaders, which is:
- 4 cheerleaders at 64 inches each: \(4 \times 64 = 256\) inches
- 3 cheerleaders at 64 inches each: \(3 \times 64 = 192\) inches
- 2 cheerleaders at 64 inches each: \(2 \times 64 = 128\) inches
- 1 cheerleader at 60 inches: \(1 \times 60 = 60\) inches

Adding these together:
\[256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636\] inches

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[636 \div 12 = 53\] feet

Therefore, the height of the human pyramid is 53 feet.

"To find out how much money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks, we need to calculate the cost of his morning and afternoon rides and then sum them up for the 14 days.

First, let's calculate the cost of the morning rides:
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- He drives in the morning twice a day, but since the cost is per ride, we only count it once per day.
- Over 14 days, the total cost for morning rides is 14 days * $6/day = $84.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the afternoon rides:
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- He drives in the afternoon twice a day, but again, the cost is per ride, so we count it once per day.
- Over 14 days, the total cost for afternoon rides is 14 days * $2/day = $28.

Now, we add the total costs of the morning and afternoon rides to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of morning rides + Cost of afternoon rides
- Total cost = $84 + $28 = $112

Therefore, Paul spent $112 on driving his car during these two weeks.

"To determine how many Greek orange pies Brianne and Ashley can make, we first need to calculate the total number of oranges they have.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box:
5 boxes * 10 oranges/box = 50 oranges

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley:
50 oranges + 20 oranges = 70 oranges

Now, we add the oranges brought by both:
50 oranges (Ashley) + 70 oranges (Brianne) = 120 oranges

Each Greek orange pie requires 3 oranges, so the number of pies they can make is:
120 oranges / 3 oranges/pie = 40 pies

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation where the total cost of each venue is the same.

Let \( x \) be the number of guests.

**Cost for the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per person
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost for the second venue:**
- Cost per person: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We set the total costs equal to each other to find the number of guests \( x \) where the costs are the same:

\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

"To solve this problem, let's set up some equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( D \) represent the number of insects David found.
2. Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects.
3. David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 7) + 2D = 43 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ D = 9 \]

Now, we know David found 9 insects. Lily found 7 more than David:

\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects.

"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to add the fractions of the skein they each used and then multiply by the total number of yards in a skein.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein. First, we add these fractions:

1/4 + 1/2 = 1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4

This means they used 3/4 of a skein of yarn together. Now, we need to find out how many yards 3/4 of a skein is. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we multiply 364 by 3/4:

364 * 3/4 = 364 * 0.75 = 273

So, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"To find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost, let's break down the information given:

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. Two of these packs were strawberry flavored.
3. One pack was grape flavored, which cost $2.
4. One pack was green apple flavored, which cost half as much as the grape pack, so it cost $2 / 2 = $1.
5. The total cost for all the packs was $7.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \).

The total cost can be represented by the equation:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

"To determine the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the number of sticks he can get from each type of wood and then see how many of each he can buy with his $24.

First, let's calculate the number of sticks per dollar for each type of wood:
- A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and provides 200 sticks. Therefore, the number of sticks per dollar is:
  \[
  \frac{200 \text{ sticks}}{4 \text{ dollars}} = 50 \text{ sticks per dollar}
  \]
- A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and provides 400 sticks. Therefore, the number of sticks per dollar is:
  \[
  \frac{400 \text{ sticks}}{6 \text{ dollars}} \approx 66.67 \text{ sticks per dollar}
  \]

Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood provides more sticks per dollar, it is the more cost-effective option. However, the question asks for the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber, which is the 2 x 4 piece of wood.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 4 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with $24:
\[
\frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars per piece}} = 6 \text{ pieces}
\]

Each 2 x 4 piece of wood provides 200 sticks, so the total number of sticks from 6 pieces is:
\[
6 \text{ pieces} \times 200 \text{ sticks per piece} = 1200 \text{ sticks}
\]

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make if he buys the cheapest lumber is:

"To determine the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs and the cost per pair.

Step 1: Total number of legs
Each dog has 4 legs, and Mario has 6 dogs.
Total legs = 4 legs/dog * 6 dogs = 24 legs

Step 2: Number of pairs of snowshoes
Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2 to find the number of pairs.
Number of pairs = 24 legs / 2 legs/pair = 12 pairs

Step 3: Total cost
Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
Total cost = 12 pairs * $12.00/pair = $144.00

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $144.00.

"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we first need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day, and each trip costs $2.20. Therefore, the cost per day for her bus trips is:
\[ 2 \times 2.20 = 4.40 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she takes these trips five days a week, the total weekly cost without the pass is:
\[ 4.40 \times 5 = 22.00 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of the weekly bus pass is $20.00. To find out how much she saves, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of the trips:
\[ 22.00 - 20.00 = 2.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Janet would save:
\[ 2.00 \]

"To solve this problem, let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot together is $120,000:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Now, solve for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house:

\[ H = 3L \]
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost $90,000.

2. **Total Revenue**: She sold each bag for $8. Since she sold all 40 bags, her total revenue is \(40 \times 8 = 320\) dollars.

3. **Profit**: Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost. So, her profit is \(320 - 160 = 160\) dollars.

"To find out how many punches Joe throws in a fight, we need to calculate the total number of punches per minute and then multiply that by the total number of minutes in the fight.

Joe throws 25 punches per minute. A fight lasts 5 rounds, and each round is 3 minutes long. So, the total number of minutes in the fight is 5 rounds * 3 minutes/round = 15 minutes.

Now, we multiply the number of punches per minute by the total number of minutes in the fight:

25 punches/minute * 15 minutes = 375 punches

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially:

- Four $10 bills: \(4 \times 10 = 40\) dollars
- Six $20 bills: \(6 \times 20 = 120\) dollars

Total amount of money Ali has: \(40 + 120 = 160\) dollars

Next, Ali gives half of this total to his sister:

- Half of $160: \(160 \div 2 = 80\) dollars

So, Ali is left with \(160 - 80 = 80\) dollars.

Then, Ali uses \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining $80 to buy dinner:

- \( \frac{3}{5} \) of $80: \( \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48 \) dollars

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:

- \(80 - 48 = 32\) dollars

"To find out how many minutes Royce takes to shingle a house, we first need to calculate double the time Rob takes and then add the additional 40 minutes.

Rob takes 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes (since 1 hour = 60 minutes).

Double the time Rob takes is:
2 * 120 minutes = 240 minutes

Now, we add the additional 40 minutes that Royce takes:
240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes

So, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house.

"To find out how many skeins of wool Martha will need, we can calculate the total number of skeins required for each item and then multiply by the number of grandchildren, since she is making a set of winter wear for each of them.

Here's the breakdown:

- Hats: 2 skeins per hat * 3 grandchildren = 6 skeins
- Scarves: 4 skeins per scarf * 3 grandchildren = 12 skeins
- Sweaters: 12 skeins per sweater * 3 grandchildren = 36 skeins
- Mittens: 1 skein per pair of mittens * 3 grandchildren = 3 skeins
- Socks: 2 skeins per pair of socks * 3 grandchildren = 6 skeins

Now, we add up all the skeins needed:

6 (hats) + 12 (scarves) + 36 (sweaters) + 3 (mittens) + 6 (socks) = 63 skeins

Martha will need to buy 63 skeins of wool.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Chris starts with 100 math problems.
2. On Monday, he completes 12 problems. So, the remaining problems are:
   100 - 12 = 88 problems.

3. On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday. Since he did 12 problems on Monday, on Tuesday he completes:
   3 * 12 = 36 problems.
   The remaining problems after Tuesday are:
   88 - 36 = 52 problems.

4. On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining problems. So, he completes:
   1/4 * 52 = 13 problems.
   The remaining problems after Wednesday are:
   52 - 13 = 39 problems.

Therefore, Chris has 39 math problems left to complete on Thursday.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the picking rates for each person:

- Tony picks 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
- Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby picks \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
- Kathy picks twice as many quarts as Bobby, so Kathy picks \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
- Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky picks \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up the total quarts picked per hour by all four:

- Tony: 6 quarts
- Bobby: 5 quarts
- Kathy: 10 quarts
- Ricky: 8 quarts

Total quarts picked per hour = \(6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29\)

"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakers had left, we need to start with the total number of loaves baked and then subtract the number of loaves sold and add the number of loaves returned.

1. Total loaves baked: 200
2. Loaves sold in the morning: 93
3. Loaves sold in the afternoon: 39
4. Loaves returned: 6

First, we calculate the total number of loaves sold:
93 (morning) + 39 (afternoon) = 132 loaves sold

Next, we subtract the total number of loaves sold from the total number of loaves baked:
200 (baked) - 132 (sold) = 68 loaves remaining

Finally, we add the number of loaves returned to the remaining loaves:
68 (remaining) + 6 (returned) = 74 loaves

So, the bakers had 74 loaves of bread left.

"To determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to figure out how many cups of raisins she will allocate to the oatmeal cookies.

Heather has 27 cups of raisins in total. She wants to divide the raisins equally among three uses: oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix. Therefore, each use will get:

27 cups / 3 = 9 cups

Now, we know that each batch of oatmeal cookies requires 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches she can make with 9 cups, we divide the total amount of raisins for cookies by the amount needed per batch:

9 cups / (3/4 cup per batch) = 9 cups * (4/3 batches per cup) = 12 batches

Therefore, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device, we need to calculate the total cost of electricity for both scenarios and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate the weekly cost before adding the new device:**
   - Daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
   - Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50
   - Daily cost: \( 12 \text{ kW/h} \times 1.50 \text{ USD/kW/h} = 18 \text{ USD/day} \)
   - Weekly cost: \( 18 \text{ USD/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 126 \text{ USD/week} \)

2. **Calculate the weekly cost after adding the new device:**
   - New daily consumption: \( 12 \text{ kW/h} + 2 \text{ kW/h} = 14 \text{ kW/h} \)
   - Daily cost: \( 14 \text{ kW/h} \times 1.50 \text{ USD/kW/h} = 21 \text{ USD/day} \)
   - Weekly cost: \( 21 \text{ USD/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 147 \text{ USD/week} \)

3. **Calculate the difference in weekly cost:**
   - Difference: \( 147 \text{ USD/week} - 126 \text{ USD/week} = 21 \text{ USD/week} \)

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is 21 USD/week.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the rate of one person:**
   - One person can paint half a house in 5 days.
   - Therefore, one person can paint a whole house in 10 days (since 5 days is for half a house).

2. **Convert the rate to hours:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - So, one person can paint a whole house in 10 days * 24 hours/day = 240 hours.

3. **Determine the rate for 5 people:**
   - If one person can paint a house in 240 hours, then 5 people working together can paint 5 times as fast.
   - Therefore, 5 people can paint a house in 240 hours / 5 = 48 hours.

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not purchased the headphone set, we first need to determine the cost of the headphone set. We know the total amount Tom spent and the cost of one CD.

The total amount spent is $48, and the cost of the CD is $4. The cost of the headphone set can be calculated by subtracting the cost of the CD from the total amount spent:

Cost of headphone set = Total amount spent - Cost of CD
Cost of headphone set = $48 - $4
Cost of headphone set = $44

Now, to find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought with the amount he spent on the headphone set, we divide the cost of the headphone set by the cost of one CD:

Number of additional CDs = Cost of headphone set / Cost of one CD
Number of additional CDs = $44 / $4
Number of additional CDs = 11

So, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had not bought the headphone set.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we can start by calculating the total hours if he had worked out 4 hours every week, and then add the extra hours from the weeks he worked out more.

1. If Josh worked out 4 hours every week for 8 weeks, the total would be:
   \( 4 \, \text{hours/week} \times 8 \, \text{weeks} = 32 \, \text{hours} \)

2. However, there are two weeks where he worked out 5 hours each, which is 1 hour extra per week for two weeks:
   \( 1 \, \text{extra hour/week} \times 2 \, \text{weeks} = 2 \, \text{extra hours} \)

3. There is also one week where he worked out 6 hours, which is 2 hours extra for that week:
   \( 2 \, \text{extra hours} \)

Adding these extra hours to the initial total:
\( 32 \, \text{hours} + 2 \, \text{extra hours} + 2 \, \text{extra hours} = 36 \, \text{hours} \)

So, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off. This leaves 48 - 8 = 40 passengers on the bus.
3. 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 * 8 = 40 people get on the bus.
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is 40 (remaining) + 40 (new) = 80 passengers.
5. On the second stop, 21 passengers get off. This leaves 80 - 21 = 59 passengers on the bus.
6. 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus. ""3 times fewer"" means one-third as many. So, 21 / 3 = 7 passengers get on the bus.
7. After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is 59 (remaining) + 7 (new) = 66 passengers.

Therefore, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is 66.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \).

2. **Determine Jame's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.

3. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, the cousin's age in 8 years will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \).

4. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If the cousin will be 55 in 8 years, the cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \).

5. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - The current age difference is \( 47 - 22 = 25 \).

"To find the cost of one monitor, let's break down the information given:

1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
2. The computer costs $1,100.
3. The printer costs $400 less than the computer, so the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 monitors. We can do this by subtracting the cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost:

Total cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - Cost of computer - Cost of printer
Total cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - $1,100 - $700
Total cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - $1,800
Total cost of 2 monitors = $600

Since this is the cost for 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor would be half of that:

Cost of one monitor = Total cost of 2 monitors / 2
Cost of one monitor = $600 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $300

So, the cost of one monitor is $300.

2. **Calculate the number of seashells brought by each boy:**
   - Each boy brought back 60 seashells.

3. **Calculate the number of seashells brought by each girl:**
   - Each girl brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.
   - This can be expressed as: \( \text{Number of seashells brought by each girl} = 60 + 4 \times 60 \).

4. **Perform the calculation:**
   - \( 4 \times 60 = 240 \)
   - \( 60 + 240 = 300 \)

So, each girl brought back 300 seashells.

"To find out how old Anne is, we first need to determine Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4 years
Alyana's age = 10 years - 4 years
Alyana's age = 6 years

Now that we know Alyana is 6 years old, we can find out Anne's age. Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so:

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2 years
Anne's age = 6 years + 2 years
Anne's age = 8 years

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly saving target of $1125, given that he saves twice as much daily in the second half as in the first half.

April has 30 days, so the first half of the month consists of 15 days, and the second half also consists of 15 days.

Let's denote the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of the month as \( x \). Therefore, in the first half of the month, he saves \( 15x \).

Since he saves twice as much each day in the second half, he saves \( 2x \) per day in the second half. Over 15 days, this amounts to \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings from the first half and the second half:
\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

We know that the total savings for the month should be $1125:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of the month. In the second half, he saves twice this amount:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 each day in the second half of the month.

"To find out how much change Verna received, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits she bought and then subtract that from the $20 she gave.

First, let's calculate the cost of each type of fruit:
- The cost of the apples is 3 apples * $1.50/apple = $4.50
- The cost of the oranges is 5 oranges * $0.80/orange = $4.00
- The cost of the peaches is 6 peaches * $0.75/peach = $4.50

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50
Total cost = $13.00

Verna gave $20, so the change she received is:
Change = Amount given - Total cost
Change = $20 - $13.00
Change = $7.00

Therefore, Verna received $7.00 in change.

"To find out how many miles Jeff walks in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the distance Jeff walks in one day: Since Jeff's work is 3 miles away and he walks there and back, he walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home. So, the total distance for one day is 3 miles + 3 miles = 6 miles.

2. Calculate the distance Jeff walks in a week: Since Jeff works 5 times a week, we multiply the distance he walks in one day by the number of days he works in a week. So, 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

Therefore, Jeff walks 30 miles in a week.

10 packs * $0.30/pack = $3

The cost of the fruit drinks is:
5 cans * $2/can = $10

Now, we add up the costs to find the total:
Total cost = Cost of hamburgers + Cost of potato fries + Cost of fruit drinks
Total cost = $20 + $3 + $10
Total cost = $33

Carly gives a fifty-dollar bill, so the change she gets back is:
Change = $50 - Total cost
Change = $50 - $33
Change = $17

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down her sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the amount over $1000.

1. For the first $1000 in sales, she earns a 30% commission:
   $1000 * 30% = $1000 * 0.30 = $300

2. For the sales over $1000, which is $2500 - $1000 = $1500, she earns an additional 10% commission:
   $1500 * 10% = $1500 * 0.10 = $150

3. To find the total commission, we add the two amounts together:
   $300 + $150 = $450

Therefore, Antonella earned $450 in commission.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Ray's swimming time for 1 mile in warm water:**
   - When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.
   - When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold.
   - Twice as long as 16 minutes is \( 2 \times 16 = 32 \) minutes.
   - Adding 2 minutes to 32 minutes gives \( 32 + 2 = 34 \) minutes.

2. **Calculate the time Ray takes to swim 3 miles in cold water:**
   - In cold water, Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes.
   - Therefore, for 3 miles, the time is \( 3 \times 16 = 48 \) minutes.

3. **Calculate the time Ray takes to swim 3 miles in warm water:**
   - In warm water, Ray swims 1 mile in 34 minutes.
   - Therefore, for 3 miles, the time is \( 3 \times 34 = 102 \) minutes.

4. **Determine how much longer Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day:**
   - The difference in time is \( 102 - 48 = 54 \) minutes.

Thus, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

"To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we first need to calculate how much he earns in a week.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day. Therefore, his daily earnings are:
\[ 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours/day} = 10 \text{ dollars/day} \]

Since he works 4 days a week, his weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \text{ dollars/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
\[ 80 \text{ dollars} \div 40 \text{ dollars/week} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

"To find the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag, we can break the problem into two parts: the holes from the buttons with two holes and the holes from the buttons with four holes.

1. First, we calculate the number of holes from the seven buttons that each have two holes:
   \( 7 \text{ buttons} \times 2 \text{ holes per button} = 14 \text{ holes} \)

2. Next, we determine how many buttons have four holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have two holes, the remaining buttons are:
   \( 21 \text{ buttons} - 7 \text{ buttons} = 14 \text{ buttons} \)

3. Then, we calculate the number of holes from the 14 buttons that each have four holes:
   \( 14 \text{ buttons} \times 4 \text{ holes per button} = 56 \text{ holes} \)

4. Finally, we add the holes from both types of buttons to get the total number of holes:
   \( 14 \text{ holes} + 56 \text{ holes} = 70 \text{ holes} \)

The total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70.

   - Therefore, Octavia drinks \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) cups of coffee per day.

3. **Calculate how much coffee Juan drinks:**
   - Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks.
   - Therefore, Juan drinks \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \) cups of coffee per day.

4. **Determine how much Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake:**
   - Juan’s doctor has asked him to reduce his intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups.
   - Therefore, Juan must reduce his intake by \( 20 - 4 = 16 \) cups.

So, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups.

"To find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we first need to determine each of their weights.

1. Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds.
2. Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so:
   \( \text{Susan's weight} = 150 - 20 = 130 \) pounds.
3. Bob's weight is twice Susan's weight, so:
   \( \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times 130 = 260 \) pounds.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the three friends:
\( \text{Total weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \) pounds.

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends:
\( \text{Average weight} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \) pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the angle the sun moves relative to the ground, not just the pyramid. The sun moves 5 degrees an hour straight upward from the pyramid, and it starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground.

If the sun moves 5 degrees an hour for 10 hours, it will have moved a total of:

5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees

Since the sun starts at 32 degrees from the ground, after 10 hours it will be at:

32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees

So, the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours will be 82 degrees.

"To determine how much James spends on candles, we first need to calculate the total number of candles he needs.

1. The age of the older son is 12.
2. The younger son is 4 years younger, so his age is 12 - 4 = 8.

Next, we add the ages of both sons to find the total number of candles needed:
12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Each pack contains 5 candles, so we need to determine how many packs are required:
20 candles / 5 candles per pack = 4 packs.

Each pack costs $3, so the total cost is:
4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

James spends $12 on candles.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and then add the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- So, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we convert the total reading time into pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- Therefore, the number of pages she reads per minute is \( \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \).

Now, we calculate the total number of pages read in the first week:
- Total pages in the first week = \( 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \).

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

Finally, we add the pages read in both weeks to get the total:
- Total pages read in two weeks = \( 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \).

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( n \) represent the current age of Shiloh's nephew.

In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, in 7 years, his nephew will be \( n + 7 \) years old.

We can set up the equation:
\[ 51 = 3(n + 7) \]

Now, solve for \( n \):
\[ 51 = 3n + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3n \]
\[ 30 = 3n \]
\[ n = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"To find out how many goals all three teenagers scored, we first need to determine how many goals Mark and Anna scored based on the information provided.

Richie scored 80 goals. According to the problem, Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Therefore, we can find the number of goals Mark scored by subtracting 20 from Richie's total:

Mark's goals = Richie's goals - 20
Mark's goals = 80 - 20
Mark's goals = 60

Next, we know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. We can find the number of goals Anna scored by subtracting 45 from Richie's total:

Anna's goals = Richie's goals - 45
Anna's goals = 80 - 45
Anna's goals = 35

Now, to find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add up the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:

Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then apply that percentage to the desired temperature of 520 degrees.

First, let's find the percentage increase from the set temperature to the actual temperature when the oven is set to 450 degrees.

The actual temperature is 468 degrees, and the set temperature is 450 degrees. The difference is:

468 - 450 = 18 degrees

The percentage increase is calculated as:

(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

This means the oven is running 4% hotter than the set temperature. To find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to for a desired temperature of 520 degrees, we need to find the temperature that, when increased by 4%, equals 520 degrees.

Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set the oven to. We can set up the equation:

\( x + 0.04x = 520 \)

This simplifies to:

\( 1.04x = 520 \)

Solving for \( x \):

\( x = \frac{520}{1.04} \)

\( x = 500 \)

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve a temperature of 520 degrees.

"To find out how much each pair of contacts will cost Pete if he buys 2 boxes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost for 2 boxes of contacts with the 10% discount.
2. Determine the total number of contacts Pete will get from 2 boxes.
3. Divide the total cost by the total number of contacts to find the cost per contact.

First, let's calculate the total cost for 2 boxes of contacts with the 10% discount:

- The original price for 1 box is $100.00.
- The discount is 10%, so the discount amount per box is 10% of $100.00, which is $10.00.
- The discounted price per box is $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.
- For 2 boxes, the total cost is 2 * $90.00 = $180.00.

Next, let's determine the total number of contacts Pete will get from 2 boxes:

- Each box contains 90 contacts.
- For 2 boxes, the total number of contacts is 2 * 90 = 180 contacts.

Finally, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts to find the cost per contact:

"To determine how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total number of calories she burns during her exercise session.

1. Calculate the calories burned during aerobics:
   - Hannah does aerobics for 2 hours at a rate of 500 calories per hour.
   - Calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

2. Calculate the calories burned during running:
   - Hannah runs for 1 hour at a rate of 600 calories per hour.
   - Calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

3. Calculate the total calories burned:
   - Total calories burned = Calories burned from aerobics + Calories burned from running
   - Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.

4. Determine the amount of water needed:
   - Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned.
   - Water needed = (Total calories burned / 200 calories) * 100 ml
   - Water needed = (1600 calories / 200 calories) * 100 ml
   - Water needed = 8 * 100 ml
   - Water needed = 800 ml.

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. We can express these relationships as follows:

- Number of red jelly beans, \( R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \)
- Number of green jelly beans, \( G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \)

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \):

\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms:

\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

- Number of red jelly beans, \( R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Number of green jelly beans, \( G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

The difference between the number of green and red jelly beans is:

\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"To find the average of the three typing speed measurements, we first need to calculate the total sum of the three measurements and then divide by the number of measurements, which is 3.

Jared's initial typing speed: 47 WPM
After some lessons: 52 WPM
After further increase by 5 WPM: 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Now, we add the three measurements together:
47 WPM + 52 WPM + 57 WPM = 156 WPM

To find the average, we divide the total sum by the number of measurements:
156 WPM / 3 = 52 WPM

The average of the three measurements is 52 WPM.

"To find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts for breakfast, we need to calculate the weight change for each option and then find the difference between the two.

1. Weight loss from eating Cheerios:
   - Martin loses 1.25 pounds per week.
   - Over 5 weeks, the total weight loss is 1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 6.25 pounds.

2. Weight gain from eating donuts:
   - Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week.
   - Over 5 weeks, the total weight gain is 1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds.

3. The difference in weight between the two options:
   - The difference is the sum of the weight loss and weight gain, since one is a negative change and the other is a positive change.
   - Difference = 8.75 pounds (gain) + 6.25 pounds (loss) = 15 pounds.

The difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is 15 pounds.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the total protein intake per day.
3. Multiply the daily protein intake by the number of days in a week to get the weekly protein intake.

Step 1: Since 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein, 200 grams of mushrooms will contain twice as much protein:
\[ 3 \text{ grams of protein} \times 2 = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

Step 2: John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, so he gets 6 grams of protein per day.

Step 3: To find the weekly protein intake, multiply the daily intake by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ 6 \text{ grams of protein/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein/week} \]

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms.

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( J \) represent Jerry's current age. According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, 5 years ago, Jerry was \( J - 5 \) years old. The problem states that his current age is twice this age:

\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve for \( J \):

\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

"To determine how many hours George needs to work to pay for his dental work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work and then subtract the deposit he has already made. After that, we can calculate how many hours he needs to work to cover the remaining cost.

1. Calculate the total cost of the dental work:
   - Base cost of 2 implants: 2 * $2000 = $4000
   - Additional cost for the porcelain crown: $500
   - Total cost: $4000 + $500 = $4500

2. Subtract the deposit George has already made:
   - Remaining cost: $4500 - $600 = $3900

3. Calculate how many hours George needs to work to earn the remaining amount:
   - George earns $15 per hour, so the number of hours needed is $3900 / $15 = 260 hours

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours to pay for the dental work.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, the second angle is twice the smallest angle, which is \( 2x \) degrees, and the third angle is three times the smallest angle, which is \( 3x \) degrees.

Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

The largest angle is \( 3x \), so we calculate:
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents, since each gumball costs 5 cents (a nickel).

- Quarters: 8 quarters * 25 cents/quarter = 200 cents
- Dimes: 6 dimes * 10 cents/dime = 60 cents
- Nickels: 14 nickels * 5 cents/nickel = 70 cents
- Pennies: 15 pennies * 1 cent/penny = 15 cents

Now, we add up all the cents:

200 cents (from quarters) + 60 cents (from dimes) + 70 cents (from nickels) + 15 cents (from pennies) = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The speed of the plane can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Given that the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, the speed of the plane is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 additional hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour

Next, we calculate how many pounds Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we calculate Marissa's hourly production as follows:

120 pounds * (3/4) = 90 pounds per hour

Now, we need to find out how many pounds each of them can make in 12 hours. For Ruiz:

60 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds

For Marissa:

90 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 1080 pounds

Finally, we add the total pounds of chocolates made by both Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours:

720 pounds + 1080 pounds = 1800 pounds

Therefore, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together in 12 hours is:

"To calculate the total earnings, we need to break down the sales into two parts and then sum the earnings from each part.

For the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour were 15 cups * $0.50/cup = $7.50.
- Over four hours, the total earnings were 4 hours * $7.50/hour = $30.00.

For the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour were 10 cups * $0.60/cup = $6.00.
- Over two hours, the total earnings were 2 hours * $6.00/hour = $12.00.

Adding the earnings from both parts:

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tires will undergo based on Jeremy's monthly driving distance and then determine how many months (and subsequently years) it will take to reach the tire's maximum rotation capacity.

1. First, calculate the number of rotations per mile:
   - 725 rotations every 2 miles means 725 / 2 = 362.5 rotations per mile.

2. Next, calculate the number of rotations per month:
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, so the number of rotations per month is 400 * 362.5 = 145,000 rotations per month.

3. Determine the total number of months the tire will last:
   - The tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations, so the number of months the tire will last is 10,440,000 / 145,000 = 72 months.

4. Convert the number of months to years:
   - 72 months / 12 months per year = 6 years.

Therefore, the tire will need to be replaced in 6 years.

"To find out how much each pump of shampoo costs, we first need to determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from the bottle if she uses 1 pump per wash. Since the bottle provides 120 washes with 2 pumps per wash, doubling the number of washes by using 1 pump per wash gives us:

120 washes * 2 = 240 washes

Now, we need to find the cost per wash. The jumbo bottle costs $24.00, so we divide the total cost by the number of washes:

$24.00 / 240 washes = $0.10 per wash

Since the question asks for the cost per pump in cents, we convert dollars to cents:

$0.10 = 10 cents

So, each pump costs 10 cents.

"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we first need to calculate the total number of street lights and then subtract the number of street lights that are not working.

1. Calculate the total number of street lights:
   - Each pole has 4 street lights.
   - There are 6 poles at each intersection.
   - There are 4 intersections.

   Total number of street lights = 4 (lights per pole) * 6 (poles per intersection) * 4 (intersections)
   Total number of street lights = 4 * 6 * 4 = 96

2. Subtract the number of street lights that are not working:
   - 20 street lights are not working.

   Total number of functioning street lights = Total number of street lights - Number of non-functioning street lights
   Total number of functioning street lights = 96 - 20 = 76

"To determine how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, let's break down his gum usage and the distribution to his sister.

1. **Gum used at school:** Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
   \]

2. **Gum used on the way home:** He chews 1 piece on the way home from school.

3. **Gum used after dinner:** He chews 1 piece after dinner.

So, the total number of pieces of gum Jim chews during the day is:
\[
4 \text{ pieces (at school)} + 1 \text{ piece (on the way home)} + 1 \text{ piece (after dinner)} = 6 \text{ pieces}
\]

4. **Gum remaining before giving to his sister:** Jim started with a 20-pack of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has:
\[
20 - 6 = 14 \text{ pieces}
\]

5. **Gum given to his sister:** Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Therefore, he gives:
\[
\frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces}
\]

6. **Gum remaining after giving to his sister:** After giving 7 pieces to his sister, Jim has:
\[
14 - 7 = 7 \text{ pieces}
\]

Thus, the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is:

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb per second to kb per hour.
2. Convert the speed from kb per hour to Mb per hour.

First, we know that there are 3600 seconds in one hour. So, we multiply the speed in kb per second by 3600 to get the speed in kb per hour:

20 kb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72000 kb/hour

Next, we convert kb to Mb. Since 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb, we divide the speed in kb per hour by 1000:

72000 kb/hour / 1000 kb/Mb = 72 Mb/hour

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour.

"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the tow truck that week, we can break down the week into two parts: the first three days and the remaining four days.

For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. So, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
3 days * 10 cars/day = 30 cars

For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled four fewer cars than 10 each day, which means it pulled 6 cars each day. So, the total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:
4 days * 6 cars/day = 24 cars

Now, we add the totals from both parts of the week to get the total number of cars towed for the entire week:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we first need to convert the required height from feet to inches, since Adam's height is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the required height is:

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Adam is currently 40 inches tall and grows 2 inches each year. We need to find out how many years it will take for him to grow from 40 inches to 48 inches.

The difference in height that Adam needs to grow is:

48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, the number of years it will take for him to grow 8 inches is:

8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years

So, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To find the total price for all three jewels, let's break down the information given:

1. The price of a diamond jewel is $2000.
2. The price of a gold jewel is \( \frac{4}{5} \) times the price of a diamond jewel.
3. The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.

First, calculate the price of the gold jewel:
\[ \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times \text{Price of diamond jewel} \]
\[ \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 \]
\[ \text{Price of gold jewel} = 1600 \]

Next, calculate the price of the silver jewel:
\[ \text{Price of silver jewel} = \text{Price of gold jewel} - 400 \]
\[ \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 \]
\[ \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1200 \]

Now, add the prices of all three jewels to find the total price:
\[ \text{Total price} = \text{Price of diamond jewel} + \text{Price of gold jewel} + \text{Price of silver jewel} \]
\[ \text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 \]
\[ \text{Total price} = 4800 \]

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob. The key is to find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob.

Tom's speed is 70 miles per hour, and Bob's speed is 55 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:

70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

This means Tom is catching up to Bob at a rate of 15 miles per hour. To find out how long it will take Tom to close the 75-mile gap, we divide the distance by the relative speed:

75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class and see how many absences would push the cost per attended class over $10.

1. The total cost for the classes is $60.
2. There are 10 total classes.
3. The cost per class if he attends all of them is $60 / 10 = $6 per class.

If Manny misses some classes, the cost per attended class will increase. We need to find the point at which the cost per attended class exceeds $10.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as \( x \). The number of classes he attends will then be \( 10 - x \).

The cost per attended class will be \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \).

We need to find the largest \( x \) such that \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \).

Solving the inequality:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per attended class exceeds $10.

2. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, which is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) miles.
3. Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. If we let \(L\) represent the number of miles Lynn ran, then Reggie's distance can be expressed as \(L + 3\).

Since we know Reggie ran 20 miles, we can set up the equation:
\[ L + 3 = 20 \]

Solving for \(L\):
\[ L = 20 - 3 \]
\[ L = 17 \]

So, Lynn ran 17 miles.

"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole he plans to dig. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular hole can be calculated using the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it will take Bob to shovel 72 cubic feet of earth. We know that it takes him 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) in seconds can be calculated as:

\[ T = 72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

So, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:
   Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and there are 16 guests.
   \( 3 \times 16 = 48 \) deviled egg halves.

2. Determine how many whole eggs are needed:
   Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many whole eggs are required to make 48 deviled egg halves.
   \( \frac{48}{2} = 24 \) whole eggs.

3. Convert the number of whole eggs to dozens:
   There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
   \( \frac{24}{12} = 2 \) dozens of eggs.

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs.

"To calculate the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly hanger rental, and the monthly fuel expenses.

1. Initial cost of the plane: $150,000
2. Monthly hanger rental: $5,000
3. Monthly fuel expenses: $5,000 * 2 = $10,000

Now, we calculate the total monthly maintenance cost:
- Monthly maintenance cost (hanger + fuel) = $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000

Next, we calculate the total maintenance cost for the year:
- Annual maintenance cost = $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the annual maintenance cost to get the total cost for the first year:
- Total cost for the first year = $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000

$330,000"
"To find out how long it took Finley to cook all the food, let's break down the information given:

1. It took 30 minutes to cook rice.
2. It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so the cooking time for pork is 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.
3. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 minutes + 50 minutes = 80 minutes. Therefore, the cooking time for beans is 80 minutes / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, to find the total cooking time for all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans:

30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) + 40 minutes (beans) = 120 minutes

So, it took Finley 120 minutes to cook all the food.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, and geese have 2 legs and 1 head. We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of animal heads is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

From this, we can write the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (total number of legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To solve for \( S \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how much money Kassidy has:**
   - Aurelia has $120.
   - Kassidy has \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as much money as Aurelia.
   - Therefore, Kassidy has \( \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \) dollars.

2. **Determine how much money Rayna has:**
   - Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy.
   - Therefore, Rayna has \( 90 + 60 = 150 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money they have together:**
   - Aurelia has $120.
   - Kassidy has $90.
   - Rayna has $150.
   - Total money = \( 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \) dollars.

4. **Determine how much each person would have if they shared the total amount equally:**

"To solve this, let's break down the information:

- Christina had 30 days of moods.
- She had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral.
- The first 8 days were good, the next 8 days were bad, and the following 8 days were neutral.
- This accounts for 24 days (8 good + 8 bad + 8 neutral).
- The remaining 6 days of the month are not specified in the initial pattern.
- The next three days are specified as good, neutral, and good.

So, out of the remaining 6 days, 3 are already accounted for (good, neutral, good). This means there are 3 days left in the month.

Now, let's count the good days:
- Initial good days: 12
- Good days in the next three days: 2

Total good days: 12 + 2 = 14

Since the month has 30 days and 27 days have been accounted for (8 good + 8 bad + 8 neutral + 3 more days), there are 3 days left in the month. The question asks how many good days are left in the month, and since we have already accounted for all the good days, there are no good days left in the remaining 3 days.

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 0.

"To find out how many books Sally has, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ \text{Janey's books} = 2 \times S + 3 \]

We know that Janey has 21 books, so we can substitute 21 for Janey's books in the equation:
\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

Now, we solve for \( S \):
\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to first convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the growth rate is given in inches per day, we will convert the initial height from feet to inches.

1 foot = 12 inches

So, 20 feet = 20 * 12 inches = 240 inches

The bamboo grows 30 inches per day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches.

The total growth needed is:
600 inches (final height) - 240 inches (initial height) = 360 inches

Now, we divide the total growth needed by the daily growth rate to find the number of days:
360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.

"To find the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length of the dress as \( L \) in centimeters. According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds an additional 20 cm of lace trim. The final length of the dress is 140 cm.

The equation representing the final length of the dress is:
\[ L + 0.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( L \):
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( L \):

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( R \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write:

\[ T = R + 7 \]

The combined ages of the twins and the triplets are 44. Since there are two twins and three triplets, we can write the equation for their combined ages as:

\[ 2T + 3R = 44 \]

Now, we can substitute \( T \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now that we know \( R \), we can find \( T \):

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of each candy. We know the total cost of five lollipops and four candies is $3.20. We also know that each lollipop costs $0.40.

First, calculate the total cost of the lollipops:
5 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $2.00

Now, subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the four candies:
$3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20

Next, divide the total cost of the candies by the number of candies to find the cost per candy:
$1.20 / 4 candies = $0.30 per candy

Now that we know the cost of each candy, we can calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:
10 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $4.00
10 candies * $0.30 per candy = $3.00

Finally, add the cost of the lollipops and the candies to find the total cost:

2. **Determine the total bill:**
   - Let the total bill be \( T \).
   - The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so the cost of the heartworm check is \( 0.60T \).

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check.
   - Therefore, \( T = 40 + 0.60T \).

4. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - \( T - 0.60T = 40 \)
   - \( 0.40T = 40 \)
   - \( T = \frac{40}{0.40} \)
   - \( T = 100 \)

5. **Calculate how much John leaves with:**
   - John brought $125 with him.
   - He spends $100 on the vet bill.
   - Amount left = $125 - $100 = $25.

So, John leaves with $25.

"To find the total price of the crate, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum these costs.

1. The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple. Since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = $1.0\).
2. The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana. Since one banana costs $1.0, one orange costs \(3 \times 1.0 = $3.0\).

Now, we calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:

- The total cost for bananas: \(5 \times 1.0 = $5.0\)
- The total cost for apples: \(12 \times 0.5 = $6.0\)
- The total cost for oranges: \(7 \times 3.0 = $21.0\)

Finally, we sum these amounts to get the total cost of the crate:

\(5.0 + 6.0 + 21.0 = $32.0\)

"To determine how many more chairs Mia needs to get for the function, we first need to calculate the total number of chairs required and then compare it to the number of chairs the restaurant currently has.

1. **Calculate the total number of chairs needed:**
   - There are 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of chairs needed is:
     \[
     42 + 15 = 57 \text{ chairs}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of regular chairs and high chairs the restaurant has:**
   - The restaurant has 8 high chairs.
   - The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, so the number of regular chairs is:
     \[
     5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ regular chairs}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of chairs the restaurant currently has:**
   - The total number of chairs is the sum of the regular chairs and the high chairs:
     \[
     40 + 8 = 48 \text{ chairs}
     \]

4. **Determine how many more chairs are needed:**
   - The number of additional chairs needed is the difference between the total number of chairs required and the total number of chairs the restaurant currently has:
     \[
     57 - 48 = 9 \text{ chairs}
     \]

Mia needs to get 9 more chairs.

"To find out how many points the class is missing to go on the trip, we need to calculate the total points collected by all the students and then subtract this total from the minimum threshold of 400 points.

1. Adam has collected 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. To find out how many points Betty has, we calculate 30% of Adam's points and add it to Adam's points:
   - 30% of 50 points = 0.30 * 50 = 15 points
   - Betty's points = 50 + 15 = 65 points
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty:
   - Tom's points = 65 - 30 = 35 points
4. Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom:
   - Martha's points = 3 * 35 = 105 points

Now, let's add up all the points collected by the students:
- Adam's points: 50
- Betty's points: 65
- Tom's points: 35
- Martha's points: 105

Total points collected = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the threshold:
- Points missing = 400 - 255 = 145 points

"To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, let's first determine the capacity of each truck:

1. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.
2. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's, so Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.

Now, we know the combined capacity of the three trucks is 11,600 pounds. We can set up the equation to find Gary's truck capacity (let's call it G):

Gissela's capacity + Gordy's capacity + Gary's capacity = Total capacity
4,000 + 4,800 + G = 11,600

Now we can solve for G:

8,800 + G = 11,600
G = 11,600 - 8,800
G = 2,800

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

"To find out how many dumplings Larry cooked, we need to calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by both the males and the females.

Given that each female ate 3 dumplings, and there are 6 females, the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:
6 females * 3 dumplings/female = 18 dumplings

Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate:
3 dumplings/female + 1 dumpling = 4 dumplings

There are 8 males, including Larry, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:
8 males * 4 dumplings/male = 32 dumplings

The total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings eaten by the males and the females:
18 dumplings (females) + 32 dumplings (males) = 50 dumplings

Therefore, Larry cooked 50 dumplings.

"To find out how many feet Martha's turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we first need to determine the turtle's speed. We know that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and that the cat can run at a speed of 15 feet per second.

Let's denote the turtle's speed as \( T \) (feet/second). Since the cat is 5 times faster, we can write the relationship as:
\[ 15 = 5T \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now that we know the turtle's speed is 3 feet per second, we can calculate how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which the firefighters are raising money. We know that they raised $2100 in the first 3 hours. 

The rate of money raised per hour is:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{\text{Total amount raised in 3 hours}}{\text{Number of hours}} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how much more money they need to reach their goal of $6300:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = \text{Goal} - \text{Amount already raised} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the number of additional hours needed to raise the remaining $4200 at the rate of $700 per hour:
\[ \text{Additional hours needed} = \frac{\text{Remaining amount}}{\text{Rate}} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we add the initial 3 hours to the additional hours needed to find the total number of hours required:
\[ \text{Total hours} = 3 + 6 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

"To find the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's water used by the city for all purposes, which is 40%.
2. Calculate the percentage of the city's water use that is for industrial purposes, which is 80% of the 40%.
3. Subtract the industrial water use from the total city water use to find the non-industrial water use.

Let's do the math:

- Industrial water use: 80% of 40% = 0.80 * 40% = 32%
- Non-industrial water use: 40% (total city use) - 32% (industrial use) = 8%

So, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

"To find Marcus' total bill, we first need to calculate the cost of each type of item he ordered, then sum these costs, and finally apply the 10% discount.

1. Cost of croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 each = $15.00
2. Cost of cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 each = $10.00
3. Cost of mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 each = $12.00
4. Cost of blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins * $1.00 each = $13.00

Now, we add up these amounts to get the subtotal:
Subtotal = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the subtotal:
Discount = 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Finally, we subtract the discount from the subtotal to get the total bill:

Next, we calculate the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is the sum of the times divided by the number of animals:

Average time = \( \frac{30 + 20}{2} \) minutes = \( \frac{50}{2} \) minutes = 25 minutes

"To solve this problem, we first need to convert the length of Topher's shoe into inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 8 feet and 4 inches can be converted as follows:

8 feet * 12 inches/foot + 4 inches = 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

Now, we know that the length of Topher's shoe (100 inches) is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as \( x \) inches. The relationship can be expressed with the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ 9x = 100 - 10 \]
\[ 9x = 90 \]
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars.

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each car has 4 windows.
- Total windows in students' cars = 64 cars * 4 windows/car = 256 windows.

Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows:
- Windows smashed in students' cars = 1/4 * 256 windows = 64 windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each car has 2 windows.
- Total windows in teachers' cars = 32 cars * 2 windows/car = 64 windows.

Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows:
- Windows smashed in teachers' cars = 3/4 * 64 windows = 48 windows.

Now, we add the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars:
- Total windows smashed = 64 windows (students) + 48 windows (teachers) = 112 windows.

"To find the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue, we first need to determine the total number of spools and the number of blue spools.

The number of blue spools is the sum of the light blue and dark blue spools:
15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60 (total blue spools)

Next, we calculate the total number of spools by adding all the spools together:
15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150 (total spools)

Now, to find the percentage of blue spools, we divide the number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100:
(60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of people who had voted by midday.
2. Subtract the number of people who voted by midday from the total to find the number of people who had not voted by midday.
3. Calculate the number of people who voted between midday and 16:00.
4. Subtract the number of people who voted between midday and 16:00 from the number of people who had not voted by midday to find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00.

Let's start with step 1:

1. By midday, 2/5 of the 5000 people had voted:
   \( \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \) people had voted.

2. The number of people who had not voted by midday is:
   \( 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \) people.

3. By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining 3000 people had voted:
   \( \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \) people voted between midday and 16:00.

4. The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:
   \( 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \) people.

So, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000.

"To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need to last him 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days.
2. Determine how many packs of gum are required based on the number of pieces per pack.

Step 1: Total pieces of gum needed for 30 days
Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day, so for 30 days, he will need:
4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces

Step 2: Number of packs required
Each pack contains 15 pieces of gum, so the number of packs needed is:
120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs

Since you can't buy a fraction of a pack, and 8 packs will give him exactly 120 pieces, he will need 8 packs to last him 30 days.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dora's age is given as 15 years.
2. Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we calculate Dora's father's age as follows:
   \[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 \]
   \[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

3. Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. So, we calculate Dora's mother's age as follows:
   \[ \text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 \]
   \[ \text{Mother's age} = 38 - 4 = 34 \]

4. To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we add their ages together:
   \[ \text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} \]
   \[ \text{Total combined age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

The total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87.

"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, Beck has:

100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Now, if Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Boris will have:

100 - 10 = 90 apples.

And Beck will have:

77 + 10 = 87 apples.

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract Beck's apples from Boris's apples:

90 - 87 = 3

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now.

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many books each person has.

1. We know that Clara has 20 books.
2. Clara has two times as many books as Steven, so if we let \( S \) represent the number of books Steven has, then \( 2S = 20 \). Solving for \( S \), we get \( S = 10 \). So, Steven has 10 books.
3. Alice has 6 more books than Steven. Since Steven has 10 books, Alice has \( 10 + 6 = 16 \) books.

Now, we need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice. Clara has 20 books, and Alice has 16 books. The difference is \( 20 - 16 = 4 \).

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

   - Large stickers: 40

2. **Trading 90% of small stickers for large buttons:**
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 27 small buttons = 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons

3. **Remaining small stickers:**
   - 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers

4. **Trading 50% of large stickers for large buttons:**
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons

5. **Remaining large stickers:**
   - 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers

6. **Trading the remaining large stickers for small buttons:**
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons

7. **Total buttons:**
   - Large buttons from small stickers: 9
   - Large buttons from large stickers: 20
   - Small buttons from remaining large stickers: 60

"To find out how many puppies Jana has, we can start by determining the total number of Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls and there are 6 Pomeranian girls, we can set up the following equation:

1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's use this information to find the total number of puppies:

2/3 * Total Puppies = Total Pomeranians
2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we multiply both sides of the equation by 3/2:

Total Puppies = 18 * (3/2)
Total Puppies = 27

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies in total.

"To find out how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Jayden has initially from selling pictures.
2. Calculate how much money Ava gave Jayden.
3. Add the amount from step 1 and step 2 to find the total amount Jayden has.
4. Subtract the total amount from the cost of the camera to find out how much more Jayden needs.

Step 1: Jayden initially has $70.
Step 2: Ava gave Jayden half of her $90 allowance, which is $90 / 2 = $45.
Step 3: The total amount Jayden has is $70 + $45 = $115.
Step 4: The camera costs $200, so Jayden needs $200 - $115 = $85 more.

"To determine how many cases of shingles the third house will need, we can set up the problem with the information given:

Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs twice as many as the first house, so it needs \( 2x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so it needs \( 2x \) cases.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

The third house needs double the first house, so it needs:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To find out how many fruits George has in total, we first need to calculate the number of pears he has based on the information that he has 45% more pears than bananas.

If George has 200 bananas, and he has 45% more pears than bananas, we can calculate the number of pears as follows:

Number of pears = Number of bananas + (45% of the number of bananas)
Number of pears = 200 + (0.45 * 200)
Number of pears = 200 + 90
Number of pears = 290

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and the number of pears:

Total number of fruits = Number of bananas + Number of pears
Total number of fruits = 200 + 290
Total number of fruits = 490

"To find the total distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance they covered while driving and the distance they covered while hiking.

First, let's determine the hiking speed. The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Since they drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour, half of this speed is 25 miles per hour. Therefore, their hiking speed is:

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Distance hiked} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ miles per hour} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to find out how long they drove. The total travel time was 6 hours, and they spent 1.5 hours hiking, so the driving time is:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} - 1.5 \text{ hours} = 4.5 \text{ hours} \]

The distance they drove is:

\[ \text{Distance driven} = 4.5 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ miles per hour} = 225 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, the total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:

"To find out how much each of the other two pizzas cost, we can start by subtracting the total cost of the two pizzas that we know the price of from the total cost of all four pizzas.

The total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars. Two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars in total. So, the cost of the remaining two pizzas is:

64 dollars (total cost) - 30 dollars (cost of two pizzas) = 34 dollars (cost of the other two pizzas)

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the cost of the two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of one pizza:

34 dollars / 2 = 17 dollars

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars.

"To find out how many times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of rides on the 5 days when they ride thrice a day, and the number of rides on the 2 days when they ride twice as much as on the usual days.

First, let's calculate the number of rides for the 5 days:
- They ride 3 times a day for 5 days, so that's \(3 \times 5 = 15\) rides.

Next, let's calculate the number of rides for the 2 special days:
- On these days, they ride twice the usual amount, which is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) times a day.
- For 2 days, that's \(6 \times 2 = 12\) rides.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Fish Count:**
   - Bob initially had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.

2. **Fish Bought:**
   - Bob bought 17 more fish from the pet store. Let's denote the number of orange fish he bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish he bought as \( W \).

3. **Total Fish After Purchase:**
   - After buying the fish, the total number of orange fish Bob has is \( 3 + O \).
   - The total number of white fish Bob has is \( 4 + W \).

4. **Condition Given:**
   - Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     3 + O = 2(4 + W)
     \]

5. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     3 + O = 8 + 2W
     \]
   - Rearrange to isolate \( O \):
     \[
     O = 8 + 2W - 3
     \]
     \[
     O = 5 + 2W
     \]

6. **Total Fish Bought:**
   - We know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17:
     \[
     O + W = 17
     \]

7. **Substitute \( O \) in the Total Fish Equation:**
   - Substitute \( O = 5 + 2W \) into \( O + W = 17 \):
     \[
     5 + 2W + W = 17
     \]
     \[
     5 + 3W = 17
     \]
   - Solve for \( W \):
     \[
     3W = 12
     \]
     \[
     W = 4
     \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

"To determine how much money Andy's car is consuming per week for his commute, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Andy drives each week.
2. Determine the total amount of gas used each week.
3. Calculate the total cost of the gas used each week.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance driven each week.**

Andy drives to work and back home each day, which is a round trip of:
\[ 5 \text{ miles (one way)} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles (round trip)} \]

He drives this distance from Monday to Friday, so the total weekly distance is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ miles/week} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of gas used each week.**

Andy's car has a fuel efficiency of 10 miles per gallon (MPG). Therefore, the total amount of gas used each week is:
\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles/week}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons/week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the gas used each week.**

The price of gas is $3 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost of gas each week is:
\[ 5 \text{ gallons/week} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week is:

- So, the total number of tomatoes is \( 22 \times 5 = 110 \).

Next, we calculate the total number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants.
- So, the total number of eggplants is \( 4 \times 8 = 32 \).

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:

"To determine how much money John is missing, we first need to calculate the total amount of money required for the trip after the school's contribution. Since the school is covering half the cost of the trip, we can calculate the school's contribution as follows:

School's contribution = 1/2 * $300 = $150

The total cost of the trip is $300, so the amount John needs to raise, after the school's contribution, is:

Amount John needs to raise = Total cost - School's contribution
Amount John needs to raise = $300 - $150 = $150

John currently has $50, so the amount of money he is still missing is:

Money missing = Amount John needs to raise - Money John has
Money missing = $150 - $50 = $100

"To determine how many logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing, we first need to calculate the temperature during the night.

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees. It is 33 degrees colder during the night, so the temperature at night is:

45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, so Carson needs to raise the temperature from 12 degrees to at least 32 degrees. The difference in temperature that needs to be made up is:

32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees, so the number of logs Carson needs to burn is:

20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of groups formed. Since 90 people are split into groups of 9, we divide 90 by 9:

90 / 9 = 10 groups

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups had members bring back seashells. According to the problem, 3/5 of the groups each had members bring back 2 seashells each. So we calculate 3/5 of 10:

(3/5) * 10 = 6 groups

Now, we know that 6 groups had members bring back seashells. Each of these groups had 9 members, and each member brought back 2 seashells. So, the total number of seashells brought back by each of these groups is:

9 members * 2 seashells/member = 18 seashells/group

Finally, to find the total number of seashells brought back by all the groups that collected seashells, we multiply the number of seashells per group by the number of groups that collected seashells:

18 seashells/group * 6 groups = 108 seashells

Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is 108.

"To calculate Jamie's pay for the day she worked 11 hours, we need to consider both her regular pay for the first 8 hours and her overtime pay for the additional 3 hours.

1. Calculate the regular pay for 8 hours:
   Regular hourly rate = $20
   Regular pay = 8 hours * $20/hour = $160

2. Calculate the overtime pay for the additional 3 hours:
   Overtime hourly rate = 150% of regular hourly rate
   Overtime hourly rate = 1.5 * $20 = $30
   Overtime pay = 3 hours * $30/hour = $90

3. Calculate the total pay for the day:
   Total pay = Regular pay + Overtime pay
   Total pay = $160 + $90 = $250

Therefore, Jamie was paid $250 for her work that day.

"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we need to calculate the discount on the jeans and then subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill he uses to pay.

First, calculate the discount amount:
25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40 = $10

Next, subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:
$40 - $10 = $30

Now, subtract the sale price from the $50 bill to find out how much money Mike will have left over:
$50 - $30 = $20

So, Mike will have $20 left over.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total monthly salary for all employees.
3. Multiply the total monthly salary by the number of months (3) to get the total amount paid over three months.

Step 1: Determine the total number of employees after three months.
- Initial number of employees: 200
- Number of new employees hired each month: 20
- Number of months: 3

Total number of new employees hired in three months = 20 employees/month * 3 months = 60 employees

Total number of employees after three months = Initial employees + New employees
= 200 + 60 = 260 employees

Step 2: Calculate the total monthly salary for all employees.
- Monthly salary per employee: $4000

Total monthly salary for all employees = Number of employees * Monthly salary per employee
= 260 employees * $4000/employee = $1,040,000

Step 3: Calculate the total amount paid over three months.
Total amount paid over three months = Total monthly salary * Number of months
= $1,040,000 * 3 = $3,120,000

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is $3,120,000.

"To determine how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their current hourly rates and then find the difference in their earnings for 20 hours of work.

1. **Billy's initial hourly rate**: $10.00
2. **Billy's first raise**: $0.50, so his new rate after 2 months is $10.00 + $0.50 = $10.50
3. **Billy's second raise**: $1.00, so his new rate on his first anniversary is $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50

4. **Sally's starting hourly rate**: $10.00 + $0.50 = $10.50

Now, we calculate their earnings for 20 hours of work:
- **Billy's earnings for 20 hours**: $11.50 * 20 = $230.00
- **Sally's earnings for 20 hours**: $10.50 * 20 = $210.00

Finally, we find the difference in their earnings:
- **Difference**: $230.00 - $210.00 = $20.00

Billy will earn $20.00 more than Sally for 20 hours of work.

"To find out how many trees will be planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students:
- There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students each.
- So, the total number of students is 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students.
- Each student plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by students is 1000 trees.

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- There are 40 classes with 3 teachers each.
- So, the total number of teachers is 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers.
- Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees.

Now, we add the number of trees planted by students and teachers to get the total number of trees planted:
- Total trees = Trees planted by students + Trees planted by teachers
- Total trees = 1000 trees + 240 trees = 1240 trees

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy to make them 30% of her total collection, we first need to calculate the current total number of stuffed animals she has.

Bubbles has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

The total number of stuffed animals she currently has is:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to be 30% of the total collection. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

To solve for \( x \), we first distribute the 0.30:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To determine how many hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we first calculate the total hours she has already played.

1. Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks.
   - Half an hour is 0.5 hours.
   - Total hours for 2 weeks: \( 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \).

2. Kris then plays for 2 hours every day for 1 week. There are 7 days in 1 week.
   - Total hours for 1 week: \( 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \).

3. Adding the hours from both periods:
   - Total hours played: \( 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \).

4. The achievement requires 30 hours of playtime.
   - Hours still needed: \( 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \).

Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement.

"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it will travel:
60 miles/hour * 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it will travel:
70 miles/hour * 2 hours = 140 miles

The difference in distance traveled by the two cars after 2 hours will be:
140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

Therefore, after 2 hours, the two cars will be 20 miles apart.

"To find out how much James paid for the ring, we first need to calculate the total cost of the materials, which is the sum of the cost of the diamond and the gold. Then, we need to calculate the 30% premium on top of this total cost.

The cost of the diamond is $600, and the cost of the gold is $300. So, the total cost of the materials is:

\[ \text{Total cost of materials} = \$600 + \$300 = \$900 \]

Next, we calculate the 30% premium on the total cost of materials:

\[ \text{30% of total cost} = 0.30 \times \$900 = \$270 \]

Finally, we add the premium to the total cost of materials to find out the total amount James paid:

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = \$900 + \$270 = \$1170 \]

"To find the school's overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and divide it by the total number of students.

First, let's find the pass rate for each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed, so the pass rate is 340/500.
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed, so the pass rate is 40/100.
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth-graders, so it is 2 * (40/100) = 80/100. Since there are 400 fifth-graders, the number who passed is 400 * (80/100) = 320.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students and the total number of students who passed:

- Total students: 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000 students.
- Total students who passed: 340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 320 (fifth-graders) = 700 students.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students:

Overall pass rate = 700 / 1000 = 0.7 or 70%.

"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of mosaic he can create with those chips.
3. Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, calculate the length of the mosaic based on the area he can cover.

First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has in total:
- Each bag holds 72 chips.
- Milo has 2 bags.
- Total chips = 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips.

Next, we need to determine how many square inches of mosaic these chips can cover:
- It takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch.
- Total square inches = 144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches.

Now, we know the mosaic is 3 inches tall, so we can find the length by dividing the total area by the height:
- Length = Total area / Height = 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches.

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"To find out how many gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party, we first need to calculate the total amount of tea that was consumed and then add the 10 quarts that were left over. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the four students who each drank 1.5 quarts:
4 students * 1.5 quarts/student = 6 quarts

Next, we calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the 16 students who each drank 2 quarts:
16 students * 2 quarts/student = 32 quarts

Now, we add the tea consumed by all the students together:
6 quarts + 32 quarts = 38 quarts

Then, we add the 10 quarts that were left over to find the total amount of tea that was at the beginning of the party:
38 quarts + 10 quarts = 48 quarts

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
48 quarts / 4 quarts/gallon = 12 gallons

Therefore, there were 12 gallons of tea at the beginning of the party.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of May and then subtract the initial number of students (10) to find out how many additional students have joined.

The number of students doubles at the end of every month. Starting with 10 students:

- At the end of January: \(10 \times 2 = 20\)
- At the end of February: \(20 \times 2 = 40\)
- At the end of March: \(40 \times 2 = 80\)
- At the end of April: \(80 \times 2 = 160\)
- At the end of May: \(160 \times 2 = 320\)

By the end of May, there are 320 students on campus. To find the number of additional students who have joined, we subtract the initial number of students (10) from the total number of students at the end of May (320):

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed on average per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches climbed in the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in the week to find the average.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 per branch and he made $105 in a week. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total earnings by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches} = 420 \]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day.

"To find the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase, we need to calculate the number of petals on the flowers Rose picked and then subtract the petals from the flowers she dropped.

1. First, she picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
   \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals

2. Then, she picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
   \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals

3. Next, she adds 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
   \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals

4. Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
   \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\(15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\) petals

Since she drops 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract the petals of one of each type of flower:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

Total petals dropped:
\(5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\) petals

Subtracting the petals of the dropped flowers from the total gives:
\(101 - 22 = 79\) petals

Therefore, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total marshmallows in the bag**: 35
2. **Marshmallows used by John**: 9
3. **Marshmallows used by DeSean**: 9
4. **Marshmallows dropped on the ground**: 3

First, calculate the total number of marshmallows used and dropped:

\[ 9 \text{ (John's S'mores)} + 9 \text{ (DeSean's S'mores)} + 3 \text{ (dropped)} = 21 \]

Next, subtract the total number of marshmallows used and dropped from the initial number of marshmallows:

\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \]

So, there are 14 marshmallows left in the bag. Since John and DeSean are sharing these marshmallows equally, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2:

\[ 14 \div 2 = 7 \]

Each kid can have 7 more S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

"To determine how much money is used, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then convert that time into the number of quarters used.

1. **Jack's Play Time:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
   - They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.
   - Number of quarters Jack uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \).

2. **Two Friends (Worse Players):**
   - Each of these friends can play for 10 minutes per quarter (half of Jack's time).
   - Number of quarters each worse friend uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters} \).
   - Since there are two worse friends, total quarters used by both: \( 24 \text{ quarters} \times 2 = 48 \text{ quarters} \).

3. **One Friend (Better Player):**
   - This friend can play for 30 minutes per quarter (1.5 times Jack's time).
   - Number of quarters the better friend uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \).

4. **Total Quarters Used:**
   - Jack: 12 quarters
   - Two worse friends: 48 quarters
   - One better friend: 8 quarters
   - Total quarters used: \( 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters} \).

5. **Total Money Used:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Total money used: \( 68 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 17 \text{ dollars} \).

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables for the amounts of each ingredient Tanya uses:

- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since the amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces.
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so \( s = 2z \).

The total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:

\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2z + 2s + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]

Since \( s = 2z \), we substitute \( s \) in the equation:

\[ 2z + 4(2z) = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 8z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find \( s \):

\[ s = 2z = 2(1) = 2 \]

Finally, the amount of oil is:

\[ 2s = 2(2) = 4 \]

So, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cars Joe has initially:**
   - Robert has 20 cars.
   - Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - Therefore, Joe has \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) cars.

2. **Calculate the number of cars Joe sells:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - 20% of 40 cars is \( 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \) cars.

3. **Calculate the number of cars Joe gives away:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold.
   - He sold 8 cars, so he gives away \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \) cars.

4. **Determine the total number of cars Joe no longer has:**
   - Joe sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars.
   - The total number of cars Joe no longer has is \( 8 + 16 = 24 \) cars.

5. **Calculate the number of cars Joe has left:**
   - Joe initially had 40 cars.
   - After selling and giving away cars, he has \( 40 - 24 = 16 \) cars left.

Therefore, Joe remains with 16 cars.

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of cards each person has in terms of PJ's cards. Let's say PJ has \( x \) cards.

Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has \( 3x \) cards.

Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3x + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is the sum of the cards each person has, which is given as 341. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + 3x + 3x + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7x + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ 7x = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[ x = 47 \]

Now, we know PJ has 47 cards. To find out how many cards Becca has, we use the expression for Becca's cards:

\[ 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, Becca has 153 cards.

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so:
   \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) blue eggs.
3. She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so:
   \( 10 - 1 = 9 \) pink eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so:
   \( \frac{9}{3} = 3 \) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs:

- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

Total number of eggs: \( 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 \)

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book and the amount she will be refunded by Amazon.

1. Calculate the shipping cost:
   - The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
   - The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
   - The total shipping cost is (4 pounds * $0.35/pound) + (20 miles * $0.08/mile).

2. Calculate the refund amount:
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which is $32.
   - The refund amount is 75% of $32.

3. Calculate the net loss:
   - The net loss is the purchase price minus the refund amount plus the shipping cost.

Let's do the math:

1. Shipping cost:
   - Weight cost: 4 * $0.35 = $1.40
   - Distance cost: 20 * $0.08 = $1.60
   - Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

2. Refund amount:
   - 75% of $32 = 0.75 * $32 = $24.00

3. Net loss:
   - Purchase price: $32.00
   - Refund amount: $24.00
   - Shipping cost: $3.00
   - Net loss: $32.00 - $24.00 + $3.00 = $11.00

Milly will lose $11.00.

"Mulan starts with $40 and her father gives her $100, so she has a total of:

$40 + $100 = $140

She spends $30 on each pair of jeans, and since she buys two pairs, she spends:

2 * $30 = $60

She also buys a bag for $20. So, the total amount spent is:

$60 + $20 = $80

Subtracting the total amount spent from the total amount she had, we get:

$140 - $80 = $60

Therefore, Mulan has $60 left.

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the monthly production.

First week production: 8,000 bars
Second week production: 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars
Third week production: 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars

Total production for the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars

Monthly production: 50,000 bars

Fourth week production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars

"To determine how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then sum these times.

1. **Time spent recording videos:**
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - She records 18 videos each week.
   - Total time spent recording videos per week: \( 18 \text{ videos/week} \times 4 \text{ minutes/video} = 72 \text{ minutes/week} \).

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - She spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Convert hours to minutes: \( 2 \text{ hours/week} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes/week} \).

3. **Time spent doing makeup:**
   - She spends 15 minutes six days a week doing makeup.
   - Total time spent doing makeup per week: \( 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 90 \text{ minutes/week} \).

4. **Total time spent on TikTok per week:**
   - Sum of all activities per week: \( 72 \text{ minutes/week} + 120 \text{ minutes/week} + 90 \text{ minutes/week} = 282 \text{ minutes/week} \).

- 2 shelves (not needed by Angela)
- 1 chandelier
- 10 pictures

Angela has:
- 6 mirrors (2 additional mirrors)
- 2 chandeliers (1 additional chandelier)
- 20 pictures (10 additional pictures)

The additional items Angela needs installed are:
- 2 additional mirrors
- 1 additional chandelier
- 10 additional pictures

The cost for each additional item is $15.00. Therefore, the total number of additional items is:
2 (mirrors) + 1 (chandelier) + 10 (pictures) = 13 additional items

The cost for the additional items is:
13 items * $15.00/item = $195.00

The total cost for Angela is the sum of the standard installation fee and the cost for the additional items:

"To find out how much money Roy has, let's break down the information step by step.

1. Eva has saved $20.00.
2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.
3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find out how much more, we calculate 40% of $30.00, which is 0.40 * $30.00 = $12.00.
4. Therefore, Roy has saved $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the height each character can lift a mountain, starting from Pompei and working our way up to Naruto.

1. **Pompei's lifting height**: Given as 1 inch.
2. **Saskay's lifting height**: Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. So, Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches.
3. **Kagiyami's lifting height**: Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. So, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.
4. **Naruto's lifting height**: Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. So, Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches.

Now, we need to convert inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot.

\[ 480 \text{ inches} \div 12 = 40 \text{ feet} \]

So, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

"To find out how many miles Mason has traveled in total, we need to calculate the distance he covered during each part of his journey and then add those distances together.

First, we calculate the distance he traveled during the first part of his journey:
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance_1 = 8 miles/hour × 4 hours = 32 miles

Next, we calculate the distance he traveled during the second part of his journey:
Distance_2 = 8 miles/hour × 6 hours = 48 miles

Now, we add the two distances together to get the total distance:
Total Distance = Distance_1 + Distance_2
Total Distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

So, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the kangaroos and then use that information to find out how long it will take the turtles to travel the same distance.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, the total time taken is 18 hours. Since the speed of the kangaroos is the same, the number of kangaroos does not affect the time taken to cross the highway. Therefore, the time it takes for one kangaroo to cross the highway is also 18 hours.

2. **Calculate the distance:**
   - Let's denote the distance across the highway as \( D \) and the speed of a kangaroo as \( S \). The formula for distance is \( D = S \times T \), where \( T \) is the time. For a kangaroo, \( D = S \times 18 \).

3. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of a turtle is \( \frac{S}{2} \).

4. **Calculate the time it takes for one turtle to cross the highway:**
   - Using the same distance \( D \), the time \( T_t \) it takes for one turtle to cross is given by \( D = \frac{S}{2} \times T_t \). Substituting \( D = S \times 18 \) into this equation, we get \( S \times 18 = \frac{S}{2} \times T_t \). Solving for \( T_t \), we find \( T_t = 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hours.

5. **Determine the time it takes for four turtles:**
   - Since the turtles are traveling at the same speed and the distance is the same, the number of turtles does not affect the time it takes to cross the highway. Therefore, it will take each turtle 36 hours to cross the highway, and thus it will take four turtles 36 hours as well.

The final answer is:

1. Kora made 20 dishes.
2. Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made \(20 + 20 = 40\) dishes.
3. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made \(2 \times 40 = 80\) dishes.

Now, to find the total number of dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora together, we add the number of dishes each person made:

\[20 + 40 + 80 = 140\]

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after the trade-in, her part-time job pay, and her mom's contribution, and then subtract the amount she still needs to buy the laptop.

The cost of the new laptop after the trade-in is:
$600 - $200 = $400

Erika has received the following amounts:
- Part-time job pay: $150
- Contribution from her mom: $80

The total amount she has received from these sources is:
$150 + $80 = $230

Erika still needs $50 more to buy the laptop, which means the total amount she has, including the money in her purse, is:
$400 - $50 = $350

To find out how much money is in her purse, we subtract the amount she has received from other sources from the total amount she has:
$350 - $230 = $120

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To find out how many apple slices are left, we first need to calculate the total number of slices Adam gets from slicing the apples.

From the large apples:
3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices

From the small apples:
5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices

Now, we add the slices from the large and small apples to get the total number of slices:
15 slices (from large apples) + 15 slices (from small apples) = 30 slices

Adam eats 15 slices, so we subtract those from the total:
30 slices - 15 slices eaten = 15 slices left

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first calculate the total amount of milk currently produced by the 3 cows.

Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, so 3 cows produce:
3 cows * 5 liters/cow/day = 15 liters/day

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The current production is 15 liters, so the additional amount needed is:
25 liters/day - 15 liters/day = 10 liters/day

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the extra 10 liters is:
10 liters/day ÷ 5 liters/cow/day = 2 cows

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we first need to calculate the remaining length of each glue stick and then sum these lengths.

1. The first glue stick has 1/6 left. The original length is 12 millimeters, so the remaining length is:
   \[ 12 \times \frac{1}{6} = 2 \text{ millimeters} \]

2. The second glue stick has 2/3 left. The remaining length is:
   \[ 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 8 \text{ millimeters} \]

3. The third glue stick has 1/2 left. The remaining length is:
   \[ 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters} \]

Now, we add the remaining lengths of all three glue sticks:
\[ 2 + 8 + 6 = 16 \text{ millimeters} \]

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters.

"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider both the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

We know that:
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

First, let's find out how many students are good at both subjects. Since there are 20 students in total, we can subtract the number of students who are good at math only and those who are good at English only from the total number of students:

20 (total students) - 5 (math only) - 8 (English only) = 7 students are good at both math and English.

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only to those who are good at both:

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we first need to calculate the total time available for performances, including the setup and exit times for each group, and the intermission.

The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.

The intermission takes 10 minutes, so the time available for performances and transitions is:
120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Each group requires:
- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

This totals to 10 minutes per group.

To find out how many groups can perform, we divide the available time by the time required per group:
110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

Therefore, Vicki can have 11 groups perform in the concert.

"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest earned and then add it to the original principal.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = P \times r \times t \]
where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (in decimal form),
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years.

Given:
- \( P = 300 \) dollars,
- The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year. To convert this to a decimal rate, we divide by the principal: \( r = \frac{225}{300} = 0.75 \),
- \( t = 3 \) years.

Now, calculate the simple interest:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3 = 675 \]

The total amount after 3 years is the sum of the principal and the simple interest:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = P + \text{Simple Interest} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

2. **White Shirts with No Collars**: The remaining white shirts do not have collars, so the number of white shirts with no collars is:
   \[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

3. **Floral Shirts with Buttons**: We are given that 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.

4. **Floral Shirts with No Buttons**: The total number of floral shirts is 50, so the number of floral shirts with no buttons is:
   \[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

5. **Difference in Number**: To find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars, we subtract the number of white shirts with no collars from the number of floral shirts with no buttons:
   \[ 30 - 20 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

- Therefore, the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45 goats.

For Farm Y:
- Mr. Smith originally has 45 goats.
- He sold twice as many goats as he did from Farm X, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats.
- Therefore, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25 goats.

Adding the goats left in both farms:
- Goats left in Farm X + Goats left in Farm Y = 45 + 25 = 70 goats.

So, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is 70.

2. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount:
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - You get $2 off for each basket of red food, so each basket of red food effectively costs \( 18 - 2 = 16 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, 3 baskets of red food cost \( 3 \times 16 = 48 \) dollars.

3. Add the costs of the green and red food baskets to find the total cost:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Claire's Badge Earnings:**
   - Claire earns 1 badge per month.
   - In 1 year (12 months), Claire earns \( 1 \times 12 = 12 \) badges.

2. **Amber's Badge Earnings:**
   - Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire.
   - Therefore, Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months.
   - In 1 year (12 months), Amber earns \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) badges.

3. **Wendy's Badge Earnings:**
   - Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.
   - In 1 year, Wendy earns \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) badges.

4. **Difference in Badge Earnings:**
   - The difference in the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber in 1 year is \( 36 - 6 = 30 \).

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame.

"Paige bakes from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours. 

In each hour, she can bake 2 banana bread loaves. So in 5 hours, she can bake:
5 hours * 2 loaves/hour = 10 loaves

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices from 10 loaves is:
10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, so the total amount raised from selling 80 slices is:
80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40.00

Therefore, Paige raised $40.00 for the fundraiser.

"To find out how many yellow cars the bumper car rink has, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of green cars:
   - The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars.
   - Since there are 12 red cars, the number of green cars is \(12 - 2 = 10\).

2. Determine the number of blue cars:
   - The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars.
   - Since there are 10 green cars, the number of blue cars is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

3. Calculate the total number of red, green, and blue cars:
   - Red cars: 12
   - Green cars: 10
   - Blue cars: 30
   - Total of red, green, and blue cars: \(12 + 10 + 30 = 52\)

4. Determine the number of yellow cars:
   - The rink has 75 cars in total.
   - The number of yellow cars is the total number of cars minus the number of red, green, and blue cars.
   - Number of yellow cars: \(75 - 52 = 23\)

Therefore, the number of yellow cars is 23.

"To solve this problem, let's set up the equations based on the information given:

Let \( S \) represent the number of books Sofie has, \( A \) represent the number of books Anne has, and \( F \) represent the number of books Fawn has.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Together, they have 85 books: \( S + A + F = 85 \)
2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne: \( S = A + 25 \)
3. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn: \( A = F - 12 \)

We can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) from the second and third equations into the first equation to solve for \( F \).

First, substitute \( A = F - 12 \) into \( S = A + 25 \):
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now, substitute \( S = F + 13 \) and \( A = F - 12 \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To determine how much money Isaias spent on the chickens he took to the market, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Since the profit is the difference between the total revenue and the cost, we can find the cost by subtracting the profit from the total revenue.

Step 1: Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
Isaias has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them.
\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = 300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180 \]

Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
Each chicken is sold for $50.
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the chickens.
The profit is $2000, so the cost is the total revenue minus the profit.
\[ \text{Cost} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for $7000.

"To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we first need to determine how many glasses each of the boys sold. Since Julie, Micah, and Mitchell together sold 32 glasses and Julie sold 14, we can subtract Julie's sales from the total to find out how many glasses the boys sold together:

32 glasses (total) - 14 glasses (Julie's sales) = 18 glasses (boys' sales combined)

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the boys' sales by 2 to find out how many each boy sold:

18 glasses (boys' sales combined) / 2 = 9 glasses (each boy's sales)

Now we can find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah by subtracting Micah's sales from Julie's sales:

14 glasses (Julie's sales) - 9 glasses (Micah's sales) = 5 glasses

So, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we first need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart.

1. **Cost of bacon:**
   - 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total.

2. **Cost of chicken:**
   - Each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - The cost of one pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2.
   - Therefore, the cost of one pack of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4.
   - The total cost for 6 packs of chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.

3. **Cost of strawberries:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.

"To find out how long Elaina's usual concerts run, we need to first subtract the time of the encore from the total runtime of the final concert. The final concert, including the encore, is 65 minutes long. The encore itself is 15 minutes long.

So, the length of the final concert without the encore is:
65 minutes - 15 minutes = 50 minutes

Since the final concert (excluding the encore) is twice as long as her usual concerts, we can find the length of her usual concerts by dividing the length of the final concert (excluding the encore) by 2.

50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes

Therefore, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

"To find out how fast a whirligig spins, we need to first determine the speed of a thingamabob, since the speed of a whirligig is based on the speed of a thingamabob.

We know that:
- A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob.
- A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.

Let's denote the speed of a thingamabob as \( T \) meters per second. Then, the speed of a whatchamacallit is \( 11T \) meters per second. Since the speed of a whatchamacallit is 121 meters per second, we can set up the equation:

\[ 11T = 121 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ T = \frac{121}{11} \]
\[ T = 11 \]

So, a thingamabob spins at 11 meters per second.

Now, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a whirligig \( W \) is:

\[ W = 5T \]
\[ W = 5 \times 11 \]
\[ W = 55 \]

The whirligig spins at 55 meters per second.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the payments for mowing lawns:**
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn.
   - Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( J \).

2. **Calculate the payments for mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns:**
   - Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
   - Tasha mowed Alba's lawn 5 times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

3. **Determine the total payment for mowing lawns:**
   - Joe's payment: \( 6J \) dollars.
   - Kamala's payment: \( 6 \times 3J = 18J \) dollars.
   - Alba's payment: \( 6 \times 5J = 30J \) dollars.
   - Total payment for mowing lawns: \( 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J \) dollars.

4. **Total earnings:**
   - Tasha made a total of $80 last month.
   - Let \( L \) be the amount she made from lemonade sales.
   - Therefore, \( L + 54J = 80 \).

5. **Determine the value of \( J \):**
   - Since Joe paid Tasha $6, and we need to find out how many times she mowed Joe's lawn, we need to find \( J \).
   - We know that \( 54J \) is the total amount she made from mowing lawns.
   - To find \( J \), we need to solve for \( J \) in the equation \( 54J \leq 80 \).

6. **Solve for \( J \):**
   - Since \( 54J \) must be a multiple of 6 (because Joe paid $6 per mow), and \( 54J \) must be less than or equal to 80, the only integer value for \( J \) that satisfies this is \( J = 1 \).
   - If \( J = 1 \), then \( 54J = 54 \).

7. **Calculate the amount made from lemonade sales:**
   - \( L = 80 - 54 = 26 \).

Therefore, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales.

"To find out how much profit John makes on his car, we need to calculate his total earnings from renting out his car and then subtract his car payment from that amount.

First, let's calculate his total earnings from renting the car:

- John rents his car 10 times a month.
- Each rental is for 3 hours.
- He gets paid $25 per hour.

Total hours rented per month = 10 times * 3 hours/time = 30 hours

Total earnings from renting = 30 hours * $25/hour = $750

Now, we subtract his car payment from his total earnings to find the profit:

Profit = Total earnings - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500 = $250

So, John's profit from renting his car is $250.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how many notebooks Martha originally had. Since she bought 5 more notebooks to have a total of 7, we can set up the equation:
   \[ \text{Martha's original notebooks} + 5 = 7 \]
   Solving for Martha's original number of notebooks:
   \[ \text{Martha's original notebooks} = 7 - 5 = 2 \]

2. Next, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. So, we can calculate the number of notebooks Joseph had:
   \[ \text{Joseph's notebooks} = 3 \times \text{Martha's original notebooks} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

3. Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph after she bought 5 more. Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. The difference is:
   \[ \text{Martha's notebooks} - \text{Joseph's notebooks} = 7 - 6 = 1 \]

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

"To find the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed, we first need to calculate the distance Anis rowed. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. 

Dijana rowed 50 miles. 

To find 1/5 of Dijana's distance:
1/5 * 50 = 10 miles

So, Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana:
50 + 10 = 60 miles

Now, to find the total distance both rowed, we add Dijana's and Anis's distances:
50 + 60 = 110 miles

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total capacity of the pot in terms of bowls:**
   - The pot can hold enough soup to fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.

2. **Convert the pot's capacity to a common unit (let's use child bowls for simplicity):**
   - Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls (because 4 adult bowls = 8 child bowls), the pot can hold 8 child bowls.

3. **Calculate the total number of bowls needed for dinner:**
   - Calvin (1 adult) + his wife (1 adult) + 2 children = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 people.
   - Each adult will eat 2 child bowls (since 1 adult bowl = 2 child bowls).
   - Each child will eat 1 child bowl.
   - Total bowls needed for dinner:
     - 2 child bowls (Calvin) + 2 child bowls (wife) + 1 child bowl (child 1) + 1 child bowl (child 2) = 6 child bowls.

4. **Determine the leftover soup:**
   - The pot contains 8 child bowls of soup.
   - 8 child bowls - 6 child bowls used for dinner = 2 child bowls leftover.

5. **Calculate how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup:**
   - There are 2 child bowls of soup left.
   - There are 2 children.
   - Each child can have 2 / 2 = 1 bowl of soup for lunch.

Therefore, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 1 time.

"To find out how much William spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen he bought.

The cost of one notebook is $1.50, and William bought five notebooks, so the total cost for the notebooks is:
5 notebooks * $1.50/notebook = $7.50

The cost of one ballpen is $0.50, and William bought one ballpen, so the total cost for the ballpen is:
1 ballpen * $0.50/ballpen = $0.50

Now, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen to find the total amount William spent:
$7.50 + $0.50 = $8.00

Therefore, William spent a total of $8.00.

"To determine the total amount of material Jo needs, we first calculate the material required for the small masks and the large masks separately, and then sum these amounts.

1. **Material for Small Masks:**
   - Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
   - For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

2. **Material for Large Masks:**
   - Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
   - For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

3. **Total Material Needed:**
   - The total material required is the sum of the material for small masks and large masks: \( 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards} \).

"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to calculate the total number of tickets she bought and then divide the total amount of money she spent by this number.

First, we determine the total number of tickets:
- There are 9 movies.
- She saw each movie 3 times.

Total number of tickets = 9 movies * 3 times per movie = 27 tickets

Next, we know she spent a total of $216 on these tickets.

To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:
Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
Average price per ticket = $216 / 27 tickets

Now, we perform the division:
Average price per ticket = $8

"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many marbles Dean gives to Jamie, which is 1/5 of his total marbles.
2. Subtract the marbles given to Jamie from the total.
3. Subtract the 10 marbles given to Donald from the remaining total.

Let's do the math:

1. Dean has 30 marbles, and he gives 1/5 of them to Jamie. So, \( 30 \times \frac{1}{5} = 6 \) marbles are given to Jamie.
2. After giving 6 marbles to Jamie, Dean has \( 30 - 6 = 24 \) marbles left.
3. Dean then gives 10 marbles to Donald, so he has \( 24 - 10 = 14 \) marbles left.

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's denote Duncan's current age as \( D \) and Adam's current age as \( A \).
2. According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be written as:
   \[
   D - 8 = 2(A - 4)
   \]
3. We are also given that Duncan's current age \( D \) is 60. So, we substitute \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
   \[
   60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
   \]
4. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[
   52 = 2(A - 4)
   \]
5. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( A - 4 \):
   \[
   26 = A - 4
   \]
6. Add 4 to both sides to solve for \( A \):
   \[
   A = 30
   \]
7. Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
   \[
   A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
   \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
2. Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
3. Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
4. There were 20 red balloons.

First, calculate the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons:
\[ 20 \text{ red balloons} \times 2 \text{ pieces of bologna per red balloon} = 40 \text{ pieces of bologna} \]

Next, subtract the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons from the total number of pieces of bologna to find out how many pieces were thrown at the yellow balloons:
\[ 58 \text{ total pieces} - 40 \text{ pieces at red balloons} = 18 \text{ pieces at yellow balloons} \]

Now, determine the number of yellow balloons by dividing the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons by the number of pieces thrown per yellow balloon:
\[ \frac{18 \text{ pieces}}{3 \text{ pieces per yellow balloon}} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

"To determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs in a 30-day month, we first calculate the total miles driven in that month.

Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so the total miles driven in a month is:
\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 1000-mile intervals fit into 3000 miles, as the car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Therefore, Jon's car needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

"To find out how much allowance Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2, since they both received the same amount.

1. The cost of the cake is $11.
2. The cost of 1 dozen (12) balloons, at $0.5 for 2 balloons, is calculated as follows:
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream, at $7 each, is:
   - 2 * $7 = $14

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14
- Total cost = $28

Since this total amount is what both girls spent together, and they received the same amount of allowance, we divide the total by 2 to find out how much each girl received:
- Allowance per girl = Total cost / 2
- Allowance per girl = $28 / 2
- Allowance per girl = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

- Let \( P \) be Peter's age.
- Let \( A \) be Paul's age.
- Let \( J \) be John's age.

We are given the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years:
   \[
   P + A + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than John:
   \[
   A = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age:
   \[
   P = A + J
   \]

First, substitute \( A \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( P \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, find \( A \) and \( P \):
\[
A = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, Peter's age is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"To find out how many total balloons the girls had, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Maria invited 4 friends, so there are 5 people in total (Maria + 4 friends).
2. At the start, Maria gave each of her friends 2 water balloons, and she had 1 for herself:
   - Each of the 4 friends gets 2 balloons: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) balloons.
   - Maria has 1 balloon: \(1\) balloon.
   - Total at the start: \(8 + 1 = 9\) balloons.

3. Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons:
   - Each of the 5 people gets 3 more balloons: \(5 \times 3 = 15\) balloons.

4. Adding the balloons given by Maria's mom to the initial total:
   - Total balloons: \(9 + 15 = 24\).

So, the total number of balloons the girls had is 24.

"To determine how many new tables the charity group needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of boxes donated:**
   - 10 people each donate 5 boxes.
   - Total boxes donated = 10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes.

2. **Add the boxes they already have:**
   - They already have 10 boxes.
   - Total boxes = 50 boxes (donated) + 10 boxes (already have) = 60 boxes.

3. **Determine the total number of tables needed:**
   - Each table can hold 2 boxes.
   - Total tables needed = Total boxes / Boxes per table = 60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables.

4. **Calculate the number of new tables needed:**
   - They already own 15 tables.
   - New tables needed = Total tables needed - Tables they already own = 30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables.

Therefore, the charity group needs 15 new tables.

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs, we first calculate the amount of hay required for the goats and the sheep separately, and then sum these amounts.

1. Calculate the hay needed for the goats:
   - Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.
   - There are 15 goats.
   - Total hay for goats = 5 pounds/goat * 15 goats = 75 pounds.

2. Calculate the hay needed for the sheep:
   - Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs = 2 * 5 pounds = 10 pounds.
   - Each sheep needs 10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds.
   - There are 12 sheep.
   - Total hay for sheep = 7 pounds/sheep * 12 sheep = 84 pounds.

3. Calculate the total hay needed:
   - Total hay = hay for goats + hay for sheep = 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds.

Therefore, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay.

"First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week. John earns 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:

50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

Next, we'll subtract the amount he spends on gas and the amount he wants to deposit in the bank:

300 dollars - 50 dollars (gas) - 100 dollars (deposit) = 150 dollars remaining

Now, let's calculate the cost of the 5 pencils:

5 pencils * 10 dollars/pencil = 50 dollars

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:

150 dollars - 50 dollars (pencils) = 100 dollars remaining

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Bottles from Coupons**: The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has is:
   \[
   9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles}
   \]

2. **Bottles Given to Students**: There are 29 pupils in the class, and each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles given to the students is:
   \[
   29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles}
   \]

3. **Bottles Remaining for the Teacher**: To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles:
   \[
   900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles}
   \]

Thus, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself.

"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing, we need to consider the fixed visit fee, the labor cost, and the cost of parts.

1. The fixed visit fee is $40.
2. The labor cost is $35 per hour. Since the job took 2.25 hours, we need to round up to the nearest whole hour because the charge is for ""per hour, or part thereof."" Thus, we round 2.25 hours up to 3 hours.
3. The cost of parts is $60.

Now, let's calculate the total:

- Visit fee: $40
- Labor cost: 3 hours * $35/hour = $105

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several parts and calculate the time for each part of James's journey.

1. **Swimming the first part:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - 60% of 20 miles is \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - The time to swim 12 miles is \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \) hours.

2. **Resting on the island:**
   - James rests for half as long as the time he spent swimming the first part.
   - The rest time is \( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \) hours.

3. **Swimming the remaining part:**
   - The remaining distance is \( 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \) miles.
   - James swims the remaining distance at half his original speed, which is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour} \).
   - The time to swim 8 miles at 1 mile per hour is \( \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \) hours.

4. **Total time:**
   - The total time is the sum of the time spent swimming the first part, resting, and swimming the remaining part.
   - Total time = 6 hours (first part) + 3 hours (rest) + 8 hours (remaining part) = 17 hours.

Therefore, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours.

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can express these relationships with the following equations:
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Now, substitute these expressions into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Occupancy**: The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied.
   - Initial occupied beds = 1000 * (1/5) = 200 beds

2. **Daily Admissions**: 50 patients are admitted each day.

3. **Time Period**: We need to calculate the occupancy after 2 weeks (14 days).
   - Total patients admitted in 14 days = 50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients

4. **Total Occupied Beds After 14 Days**: 
   - Total occupied beds = Initial occupied beds + Patients admitted in 14 days
   - Total occupied beds = 200 + 700 = 900 beds

5. **Unoccupied Beds**:
   - Unoccupied beds = Total capacity - Total occupied beds
   - Unoccupied beds = 1000 - 900 = 100 beds

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
   - First day: 10 holes
   - Second day: 13 holes
   - Third day: 8 holes, but 2 holes were filled in, so the net holes dug on the third day is 8 - 2 = 6 holes.

   Total holes by the end of the third day = 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes.

2. Determine the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day:
   - The problem states that by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes was four times the number of holes at the end of the first day.
   - Number of holes at the end of the first day = 10 holes.
   - Therefore, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day = 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

3. Calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day:
   - Total holes by the end of the fourth day = 40 holes.
   - Total holes by the end of the third day = 29 holes.
   - Holes dug on the fourth day = 40 - 29 = 11 holes.

The pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokémon as Adelwolfe:
   \[
   S = 4W - 13
   \]

We can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) into the first equation to solve for \( W \).

First, substitute \( A = S + 5 \) into the total equation:
\[
(S + 5) + S + W = 339
\]
Simplify this equation:
\[
2S + W + 5 = 339
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
2S + W = 334
\]

Next, substitute \( S = 4W - 13 \) into the equation \( 2S + W = 334 \):
\[
2(4W - 13) + W = 334
\]
Distribute the 2:
\[
8W - 26 + W = 334
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
9W - 26 = 334
\]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[
9W = 360
\]
Divide by 9:
\[
W = 40
\]

Now that we have \( W \), we can find \( S \):
\[
S = 4W - 13
\]
Substitute \( W = 40 \):
\[
S = 4(40) - 13
\]
\[
S = 160 - 13
\]
\[
S = 147
\]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.

"To find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we need to determine the total number of episodes and then multiply that by the length of each episode.

Given that each episode is 20 minutes long and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can set up the following relationship:

Number of episodes = 20 / 2 = 10 episodes

Now, to find the total time spent watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

Total time = Number of episodes * Length of each episode
Total time = 10 episodes * 20 minutes/episode
Total time = 200 minutes

So, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show if he watches every episode.

"To determine the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction, as the bird's final destination is her southern home.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: North
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled south by subtracting the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:

- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \)
- Distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \)

Net distance traveled south:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.

"To find out how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she had and then subtract the number of brownies that were eaten.

1. Greta made a batch of 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself. That's 12 brownies.
2. She was sent home with 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office party. That's 6 brownies.
3. Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting for her at the surprise party. That's 48 brownies.
4. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. That's 18 brownies.

Now, let's add up all the brownies she had:

12 (from herself) + 6 (from the office) + 48 (from the surprise party) = 66 brownies.

Next, we subtract the brownies that were eaten:

66 (total brownies) - 18 (eaten) = 48 brownies.

So, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day.

"To find the total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister, we first need to determine each of their ages based on the information provided.

1. Nani's age is given as 8 years old.
2. Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \) years old.
3. Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find her age, we calculate 25% of Nani's age and subtract it from Nani's age:
   - 25% of 8 is \( 8 \times 0.25 = 2 \).
   - Therefore, Nani's sister's age is \( 8 - 2 = 6 \) years old.

Now, we add up the ages of all three family members:
- Nani: 8 years
- Brother: 16 years
- Sister: 6 years

Total age = \( 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \) years.

"To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

Number of players on Zeke's team = Number of players on Carlton's team + 7
Number of players on Zeke's team = 13 + 7
Number of players on Zeke's team = 20

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

Total number of players = Number of players on Zeke's team + Number of players on Carlton's team
Total number of players = 20 + 13
Total number of players = 33

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Mrs. Harrington initially bought 12 boxes of oranges.
2. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes given away.
3. After giving away 4 boxes, she has 12 - 4 = 8 boxes left.
4. She then kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges. Since there are 8 boxes left, 1/4 of 8 boxes is 2 boxes.
5. This means she kept 2 boxes and sold the remaining 8 - 2 = 6 boxes.
6. Since each box contains 20 oranges, the number of oranges she sold is 6 boxes * 20 oranges/box.

Now, let's calculate the total number of oranges sold:

6 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 120 oranges

"To determine how much Sunny earned over the two days, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold each day and then multiply by the respective prices.

First, let's find out how many boxes of each item Sunny sold on each day.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes (4 fewer than gingerbread)

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes (5 more than Saturday)
- Apple pie: 15 boxes (as given)

Next, we calculate the total number of boxes sold over the two days:

**Total gingerbread:**
- Saturday: 10 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes
- Total: 10 + 15 = 25 boxes

**Total apple pie:**
- Saturday: 6 boxes
- Sunday: 15 boxes

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet**: Since 12 inches is equal to 1 foot, each flower is 1 foot wide.

2. **Calculate the total space required for each plant including the space between them**: Each plant requires 1 foot of space for the plant itself and 1.5 feet of space between plants, totaling 2.5 feet per plant.

3. **Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed**: The flower bed is 111 feet long. To find out how many plants can fit, we divide the length of the flower bed by the total space required per plant:
   \[
   \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4 \text{ plants}
   \]
   Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants Pat needs**: Pat already owns 17 plants, so the number of additional plants needed is:
   \[
   44 \text{ plants} - 17 \text{ plants} = 27 \text{ plants}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost for the additional plants**: Each plant costs $6, so the total cost is:

"To determine how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount Jessica sets aside each month for shoes.
2. Determine the total amount set aside in a year.
3. Calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy with the total amount.

Step 1: Calculate the monthly savings for shoes.
Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for shoes.
25% of $2,000.00 = 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00

Step 2: Determine the total amount set aside in a year.
Jessica saves $500.00 each month, so in a year (12 months), she will save:
$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Step 3: Calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy.
Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so the number of pairs she can buy is:
$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the task into two parts: peeling and sauteing.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, we divide the total number of shrimp by the rate at which she peels them:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sauteing the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To saute 90 shrimp, we first determine how many batches of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp:
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
     \]
   - Since each batch takes 10 minutes to saute, the total time to saute 90 shrimp is:
     \[
     \text{Time to saute 90 shrimp} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to peel and saute 90 shrimp is the sum of the time to peel and the time to saute:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet the second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet the second time, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, the final answer is:

"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and then subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6. His father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 (from his mother) + $12 (from his father) = $18.

The cost of the trousers is $30. Therefore, the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings is $30 - $18 = $12.

"To find Wilfred's age, let's start by using the information given:

1. The total age of the children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old.
3. Alessandro is 4 years old.
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar: 3 years
- Alessandro: 4 years
- Helene: \( H \) years
- Wilfred: \( W \) years

The total age of the children is the sum of their ages:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]

Simplifying this, we get:
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, Wilfred is 3 years old.

"First, let's calculate the total amount Walter has collected from his neighbors and the online fund:

$500 (from neighbors) + $1500 (from online fund) = $2000

Then, Walter's friend donates an additional $200, so the total amount collected from everyone else is:

$2000 (previous total) + $200 (friend's donation) = $2200

Walter's lawyer has offered to donate three times as much as everyone else donates, so the lawyer's contribution will be:

3 * $2200 = $6600

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of cookies brought by the guests:**
   - There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies.
   - Total cookies = 100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies.

2. **Determine how many cookies were given to the church:**
   - The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church.
   - Cookies given to the church = 1/2 * 1500 cookies = 750 cookies.

3. **Calculate the number of people in the church who received cookies:**
   - Each person in the church received 15 cookies.
   - Number of people in the church = 750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people.

Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is 50.

"To solve this problem, let's first establish the relationship between the sizes of the slices for the adults and the kids. Let's denote the size of a kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of an adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

The total watermelon can be represented as the sum of all the slices. There are 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total watermelon is:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

This means the entire watermelon is divided into 8 parts of size \( x \).

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \), and since the whole watermelon is \( 8x \), the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is:
\[ \frac{2x}{8x} \times 100\% = \frac{2}{8} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the costs and the number of sessions. However, the question does not specify the revenue or the fee charged per student per session, which is necessary to calculate earnings. Instead, I will calculate the total cost of operating the studio for a month based on the information provided.

First, let's calculate the cost of renting the studio for a session:
- Cost per session to rent the studio: $25
- Cost per student per session: $1.50
- Number of students: 10
- Total cost per session for students: 10 students * $1.50/student = $15
- Total cost per session: $25 (rent) + $15 (students) = $40

Next, we calculate the total cost for the week:
- Number of sessions per week: 3
- Total cost per week: 3 sessions * $40/session = $120

Now, we calculate the total cost for the month:
- Assuming 4 weeks in a month, the total cost per month: 4 weeks * $120/week = $480

Since the question asks for the expected earnings and we only have the cost information, we can only provide the total cost. If you meant to ask for the total cost, the answer is:

$480

If you need the earnings, please provide the fee charged per student per session."
"To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we first need to determine how many chocolate bars are in each of their boxes.

"To determine the number of porcupines in the park after a year, we first need to calculate the number of female porcupines and then the number of babies born each month, and finally, the total number of babies born in a year.

1. Calculate the number of female porcupines:
   - The total population of porcupines is 50.
   - The number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population.
   - Number of female porcupines = \( 50 \times \frac{3}{5} = 30 \).

2. Calculate the number of babies born each month:
   - Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
   - Number of babies born each month = \( 30 \times 4 = 120 \).

3. Calculate the total number of babies born in a year:
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Total number of babies born in a year = \( 120 \times 12 = 1440 \).

4. Calculate the total population after a year:

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume to gallons using the given conversion factor.
3. Calculate the cost based on the price per gallon.

Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.
The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) can be calculated using the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 25 \, \text{ft} \times 14 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \]
\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Step 2: Convert the volume to gallons.
The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the volume in gallons.
\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 5.9 \]
\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \]

Step 3: Calculate the cost.
The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon.
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{USD/gallon} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:**
   - Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity on the first day. The tank's capacity is 18,000 gallons, so:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18,000 = 4,500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda on the first day, so:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4,500 = 3,375 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   \[
   \text{Total water on the first day} = 4,500 + 3,375 = 7,875 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Determine the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the second day:**
   - Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, so:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4,500 = 3,000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, so:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3,375 = 1,125 \text{ gallons}

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge of 28%.

1. **Calculate the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 1 hour, the charge is \( x - 0.07x = 0.93x \).
   - After 2 hours, the charge is \( 0.93x - 0.07(0.93x) = 0.93^2x \).
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( 0.93^2x - 0.07(0.93^2x) = 0.93^3x \).

   Given that the final charge is 28%, we have:
   \[
   0.93^3x = 0.28
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.93^3}
   \]
   \[
   x \approx \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

2. **Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 1 hour, the charge is \( y - 0.09y = 0.91y \).
   - After 2 hours, the charge is \( 0.91y - 0.09(0.91y) = 0.91^2y \).
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( 0.91^2y - 0.09(0.91^2y) = 0.91^3y \).
   - After 4 hours, the charge is \( 0.91^3y - 0.09(0.91^3y) = 0.91^4y \).
   - After 5 hours, the charge is \( 0.91^4y - 0.09(0.91^4y) = 0.91^5y \).

   Given that the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was 34.8%, we have:
   \[
   0.91^5y = 0.348
   \]
   Solving for \( y \):
   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.91^5}
   \]
   \[
   y \approx \frac{0.348}{0.624032} \approx 0.558

   - The total earnings from small stuffed animals: \( 4S \).
   - The total earnings from large stuffed animals: \( 12L \).
   - The total earnings equation: \( 4S + 12L = 120 \).

4. **Substitute \( S = 2L \) into the total earnings equation:**
   - \( 4(2L) + 12L = 120 \)
   - \( 8L + 12L = 120 \)
   - \( 20L = 120 \)

5. **Solve for \( L \):**
   - \( L = \frac{120}{20} \)
   - \( L = 6 \)

6. **Find \( S \) using \( S = 2L \):**
   - \( S = 2 \times 6 \)
   - \( S = 12 \)

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"To find out how much money Suzanne has left from her earnings, we need to calculate her total earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes, and then subtract the amount she gave to her sisters.

First, calculate the earnings from the cookies:
80 cookies * $1/cookie = $80

Next, calculate the earnings from the cupcakes:
60 cupcakes * $4/cupcake = $240

Now, add the earnings from both the cookies and cupcakes to find the total earnings:
$80 + $240 = $320

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so the total amount given to her sisters is:
2 sisters * $10/sister = $20

Finally, subtract the amount given to her sisters from the total earnings to find out how much money Suzanne has left:
$320 - $20 = $300

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the amount of ore a dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
   - With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
   - With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which is \(24 + (0.5 \times 24) = 24 + 12 = 36\) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total amount of ore mined by one dwarf with a steel pickaxe in 30 days:**
   - One dwarf can mine \(36\) pounds per day.
   - In 30 days, one dwarf can mine \(36 \times 30 = 1080\) pounds of ore.

3. **Calculate the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in 30 days:**
   - If one dwarf can mine \(1080\) pounds in 30 days, then 40 dwarves can mine \(1080 \times 40 = 43200\) pounds of ore in 30 days.

Therefore, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month with 30 days is:

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to understand the pricing pattern based on the information given for the other two packages.

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, which means the cost per sandwich is:
\[ \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich} \]

The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, which also means the cost per sandwich is:
\[ \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich} \]

Since the prices are proportional, the cost per sandwich for the third package should also be $1.5. Therefore, for 8 sandwiches, the cost would be:
\[ 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the different scenarios where he would not have to turn it in and then subtract that from 100%.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario (50% chance):**
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus will not have to turn in his homework. This is a 50% chance.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario (50% chance):**
   - If the normal teacher is present, there is a 40% chance she will give an extension to the whole class.
   - If the normal teacher does not give an extension to the whole class (60% chance), there is a 20% chance Marcus can convince her to give him a personal extension.

Let's break down the probabilities for the normal teacher scenario:

- **Whole Class Extension (40% chance):**
  - If the normal teacher gives an extension to the whole class, Marcus will not have to turn in his homework. This is a 40% chance within the 50% chance of the normal teacher being present, so the combined probability is:
    \[
    0.5 \times 0.4 = 0.2 \text{ or } 20\%
    \]

- **No Whole Class Extension (60% chance):**
  - If the normal teacher does not give an extension to the whole class, there is a 20% chance Marcus can get a personal extension. The combined probability for this scenario is:
    \[
    0.5 \times 0.6 \times 0.2 = 0.06 \text{ or } 6\%
    \]

Now, we add up all the probabilities where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
\[
50\% + 20\% + 6\% = 76\%
\]

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:
\[
100\% - 76\% = 24\%
\]

"To determine how many tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats available for friends and family by subtracting the seats for graduates and faculty from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.
2. Divide the number of seats available for friends and family by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total seats in the Fine Arts Center: 6000
2. Seats for graduates: 950
3. Seats for faculty: 300

Total seats for friends and family = Total seats - (Seats for graduates + Seats for faculty)
Total seats for friends and family = 6000 - (950 + 300)
Total seats for friends and family = 6000 - 1250
Total seats for friends and family = 4750

Now, we divide the total seats for friends and family by the number of graduates:

Tickets per graduate = Total seats for friends and family / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5

Each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

"To determine how long it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the number of soda bottles he will place and the time it will take to move between them.

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - Number of bottles = 24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles.

2. **Calculate the time to move between bottles:**
   - Richard starts at the first bottle, so he needs to move to 7 more bottles (since he doesn't need to move after the last bottle).
   - Time to move from one bottle to the next is 5 seconds.
   - Total time to move between bottles = 7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds.

3. **Total time to set off all the soda fountains:**
   - Richard will drop the candy into the first bottle immediately, so we only count the time to move between the bottles.
   - Total time = 35 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Jim's college education, including the loans and the income he did not earn while in school, and then determine how long it will take him to earn that amount with his new, higher salary.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the loans:**
   - Jim takes $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.
   - Total loans = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000

2. **Calculate the income Jim did not earn while in school:**
   - Jim could have earned $25,000 per year if he had not gone to college.
   - Total income not earned = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000

3. **Calculate the total cost of college:**
   - Total cost = Total loans + Total income not earned
   - Total cost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

4. **Calculate Jim's new income after college:**
   - His college degree tripled his income.
   - New income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

5. **Calculate the net additional income per year after college:**
   - Net additional income = New income - Previous income
   - Net additional income = $75,000 - $25,000 = $50,000 per year

6. **Determine how long it will take to earn the total cost of college:**
   - Time to earn the total cost = Total cost / Net additional income
   - Time to earn the total cost = $300,000 / $50,000 = 6 years

Therefore, it will take Jim 6 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"To determine how much fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces he will use. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each piece of fabric will be:
6 feet (length of the bed) + 2 feet = 8 feet

And the width of each piece of fabric will be:
8 feet (width of the bed) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
8 feet (length) * 10 feet (width) = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Monday's Deliveries**: The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday's Deliveries**: They delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
   - One-fifth of Monday's deliveries: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - Tuesday's deliveries: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)

3. **Wednesday's Deliveries**: They delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.
   - Twice Tuesday's deliveries: \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \)
   - Wednesday's deliveries: \( 204 + 5 = 209 \)

4. **Total Deliveries from Monday to Wednesday**:
   - Monday: 425
   - Tuesday: 102

"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we first need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Since heights are given in both feet and inches, we will convert everything to inches for simplicity.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we can convert Xavier's height to inches:
4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer, so his new height is:
48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Cole's initial height was 50 inches, and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his new height is:
50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( x = 420 \).

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the equation based on the total number of balls:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we need to find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

So, the new monthly cost is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Next, we calculate the annual cost by multiplying the new monthly cost by 12:
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for his insurance.

"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads he does each week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a year.

1. **Calculate the number of loads per week:**
   - For the 4 twin beds, since he can wash 2 twin sets at a time, he will need to do 2 loads (4 twin sets / 2 twin sets per load = 2 loads).
   - For the 1 king size bed, he will need to do 1 load (1 king set / 1 king set per load = 1 load).

   Therefore, each week, Greg does 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads of laundry.

2. **Calculate the number of loads per year:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - So, the total number of loads per year is 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year.

"To find out how many movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of movies they watch in one weekend and then multiply that by 4.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies.
On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend, they watch a total of 4 (Saturday) + 2 (Sunday) = 6 movies.

Over 4 weeks, they would watch 4 weekends * 6 movies per weekend = 24 movies.

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to calculate the total amount of food consumed per day and then divide the total amount of food by this daily consumption.

1. First, calculate the total amount of food consumed per feeding:
   - Each cat eats 60 grams per feeding.
   - There are 3 cats.
   - Therefore, for one feeding, the total amount of food consumed is \( 60 \text{ grams/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 180 \text{ grams} \).

2. Since the cats are fed twice a day, the total daily consumption is:
   - \( 180 \text{ grams/feeding} \times 2 \text{ feedings/day} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \).

3. Now, to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we divide the total amount of food by the daily consumption:
   - \( 720 \text{ grams} \div 360 \text{ grams/day} = 2 \text{ days} \).

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many slices Jake ate:**
   - Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake.
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Therefore, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices.

2. **Determine how many slices Silvia ate:**
   - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake.
   - Jake ate 7 slices.
   - Therefore, Silvia ate \(2 \times 7 = 14\) slices.

3. **Calculate the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Jake ate 7 slices.
   - Silvia ate 14 slices.
   - Total slices eaten = \(10 + 7 + 14 = 31\).

Thus, the total number of slices they ate is 31.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the time Donovan spent on his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's part can be represented as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time spent on the meal is the sum of the time Betsy and Donovan each spent, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 40 \]

Now, we know that Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which is 18 minutes longer, is:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

So, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

2. The cost of the 30-minute visit: $300/hour * 0.5 hours = $150
3. The cost of the painkillers: $4/pill * 30 pills = $120
4. The cost of the parking: $6/hour * 2 hours = $12

Now, we add all these costs together:

$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482.

"To find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of emails that require a response each day.
2. Multiply the daily number of emails requiring a response by the number of workdays in a week.

First, we determine the number of emails that require a response each day. Since 20% of the emails do not require a response, 80% do require a response. 

80% of 80 emails is calculated as:
\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ emails per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of emails he responds to in a 5-day work week:
\[ 64 \text{ emails/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 320 \text{ emails} \]

So, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week.

"To determine the total cost of postage for Anthony's coupons, we need to calculate the cost for both the small and big coupons and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the number of big coupons:**
   Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since he is sending out 700 small coupons:
   \[
   \text{Number of big coupons} = 2 \times 700 = 1400
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost for the small coupons:**
   Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for the small coupons is:
   \[
   \text{Cost for small coupons} = 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost for the big coupons:**
   Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for the big coupons is:
   \[
   \text{Cost for big coupons} = 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   The total cost for all the coupons is the sum of the costs for the small and big coupons:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents}
   \]

5. **Convert the total cost to dollars:**
   Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar:
   \[
   \text{Total cost in dollars} = \frac{24500}{100} = 245 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:
\[
245

"To determine the cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter, we first need to understand the promotion and how it applies to his purchase.

1. Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter.
2. The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off.""

This means for every two pounds of butter, Dennis will pay full price for one pound and half price for the second pound.

- Cost for 1 pound of butter at full price: $4.00
- Cost for 1 pound of butter at half price: $4.00 / 2 = $2.00

For every 2 pounds of butter, the total cost is:
- $4.00 (full price) + $2.00 (half price) = $6.00

Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, he will buy 3 sets of 2 pounds each:
- 3 sets * $6.00 per set = $18.00

Therefore, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter is $18.00.

"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the cost of the bananas both ways and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought:
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Each bunch averages 4 bananas.
- Total number of bananas = 10 bunches * 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:
- Cost per banana = $0.80.
- Total cost for 40 bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Cost per bunch = $3.00.
- Total cost for 10 bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00.

Finally, we find the savings by subtracting the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:
- Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

"To determine how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during the month, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply by their respective prices.

1. **Total bikes sold**: 300
2. **Trekking bikes sold**: Half of the total bikes, so \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \) Trekking bikes.
3. **BMX bikes sold**: 15% of the total bikes, so \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \) BMX bikes.
4. **MTB bikes sold**: The rest of the bikes, so \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \) MTB bikes.

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:

- **Earnings from Trekking bikes**: \( 150 \times 450 = 67,500 \) dollars.
- **Earnings from BMX bikes**: The price of a BMX bike is half the price of an MTB, so \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \) dollars. Therefore, \( 45 \times 250 = 11,250 \) dollars.
- **Earnings from MTB bikes**: \( 105 \times 500 = 52,500 \) dollars.

   - John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes each day, which totals 8 classes per day.
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.
   - He goes to class for 5 days a week.

   Total minutes per day = 8 classes/day * 40 minutes/class = 320 minutes/day
   Total minutes per week = 320 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes/week

2. **Calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.

   Extra learning time per day (Saturday and Sunday) = 1600 minutes/week * 1/16 = 100 minutes/day
   Total extra learning time for both days = 100 minutes/day * 2 days = 200 minutes

3. **Calculate the total weekly learning time:**
   - Total minutes spent learning in a week = 1600 minutes (class) + 200 minutes (extra learning) = 1800 minutes

4. **Convert the total minutes to hours:**
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - Total hours = 1800 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 30 hours

Therefore, John spends 30 hours a week learning.

"To determine how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial height from which the ball is dropped. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the initial height is:
   \[
   3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. Calculate the height of the first bounce. The ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height, so:
   \[
   72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. Calculate the height of the second bounce. Again, the ball bounces to 2/3rds of the height of the first bounce, so:
   \[
   48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, the ball goes 32 feet high on its second bounce.

"To find the height of the fourth child in inches, let's break down the information step by step:

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.
2. The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.
3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.
4. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is 72 inches.

"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine how many bags of apples were sold and then multiply that by the price per bag.

1. First, we calculate the number of bags sold:
   - Total apples sold: 2000
   - Apples per bag: 10
   - Number of bags sold = Total apples sold / Apples per bag = 2000 / 10 = 200 bags

2. Next, we calculate the total earnings:
   - Price per bag: $5
   - Total earnings = Number of bags sold * Price per bag = 200 * 5 = $1000

The orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. This means that before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 kilograms of meat left after the velociraptors had their share.

2. The velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex. This means that the 270 kilograms is half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Therefore, before the velociraptors ate, there were 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms of meat.

3. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the 540 kilograms is half of the original amount of meat on the triceratops. Therefore, the original amount of meat on the triceratops was 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms.

"To determine the cost to paint the room, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

The north and south walls are each 10 feet wide by 8 feet high, so the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 80 \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are each 5 feet wide by 8 feet high, so the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

The total area to be painted is the sum of the areas of all four walls:
\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

A gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, so the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \times 12 = 144 \]

"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of picking a shaken soda from the remaining sodas.

Initially, there are 12 sodas in total, with 3 of them being shaken. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda, leaving 11 sodas (3 shaken and 8 unshaken). Ellen's brother then takes 1 shaken and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 10 sodas in total (2 shaken and 8 unshaken).

The probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas left divided by the total number of sodas left:

\[ P(\text{shaken soda}) = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas left}}{\text{Total number of sodas left}} = \frac{2}{10} = \frac{1}{5} \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ P(\text{shaken soda}) \times 100 = \frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20\% \]

60 miles/hour * 3 hours = 180 miles

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is:
60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour

In 3 hours, the second train will have traveled:
30 miles/hour * 3 hours = 90 miles

The total distance between the two trains after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each has traveled:
180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

"To determine how many people Billy helps, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy takes off.
3. Calculate the number of days Billy works.
4. Calculate the total number of people he helps based on his working days.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.

Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy takes off.**

Billy takes 20% of the days off.

Number of days off = 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days

**Step 3: Calculate the number of days Billy works.**

Number of working days = Total days - Days off = 50 - 10 = 40 days

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of people he helps.**

Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day.

People helped per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day

Total people helped = Number of working days * People helped per day = 40 days * 6 people/day = 240 people

"To find out how many hours Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to after 5 days, we can break down the calculation as follows:

1. Calculate the total break time per day:
   - Bobby takes 2 breaks of 15 minutes each, so the total break time per day is \(2 \times 15 = 30\) minutes.

2. Calculate the total time for lunch and breaks per day:
   - Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 30 minutes of breaks, so the total time per day is \(30 + 30 = 60\) minutes.

3. Convert the total time per day into hours:
   - Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, the total time per day is 1 hour.

4. Calculate the total time over 5 days:
   - Over 5 days, the total time is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) hours.

So, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours.

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times the distance that Amber ran, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

Micah's distance = 3.5 * Amber's distance
Micah's distance = 3.5 * 8 miles
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Now, we know the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We can find Ahito's distance by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - (Amber's distance + Micah's distance)
Ahito's distance = 52 miles - (8 miles + 28 miles)
Ahito's distance = 52 miles - 36 miles
Ahito's distance = 16 miles

So, Ahito ran 16 miles.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let the total number of jellyfish in the tank be \( x \).
2. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{x}{5} \).
3. A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{x}{5} = \frac{x}{15} \).
4. We are told that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. This means \( \frac{x}{15} = 6 \).

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[
\frac{x}{15} = 6
\]

Multiply both sides by 15:

\[
x = 6 \times 15
\]

\[
x = 90
\]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we can use the information that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school as \( T \).

Given that 40% of \( T \) is 240 boys, we can set up the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

Now, to find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = T - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her 9,300-mile journey in June, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June and then figure out how many miles she plans to hike each day.

June has 30 days. If Soledad hikes twice a day, covering 125 miles each time, she will hike:

\[ 125 \text{ miles/hike} \times 2 \text{ hikes/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total miles she will hike in June at this rate:

\[ 250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7,500 \text{ miles} \]

Soledad's goal is to hike 9,300 miles. The difference between her goal and the distance she will cover at her current plan is:

\[ 9,300 \text{ miles} - 7,500 \text{ miles} = 1,800 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we divide the additional miles needed by the number of days in June:

"To find out how many miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the one-way distance to his parents' house.
2. Double that distance to account for the round trip.
3. Multiply the round trip distance by the number of visits per month.

Step 1: One-way distance
Since it takes John 2 hours to drive to his parents' house at a speed of 70 mph, we can calculate the one-way distance using the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Step 2: Round trip distance
The round trip distance is twice the one-way distance:
\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

Step 3: Monthly distance
John visits his parents twice a month, so the total monthly distance is:
\[ \text{Monthly distance} = 280 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 560 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents is:

- **Toys produced by the first four workers**: 200 toys.
- **Toys produced by the fifth worker**: 380 toys - 200 toys = 180 toys.

The fifth worker worked for 10 hours, so the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is:

180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys/hour.

"To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs, we first need to calculate the weight of each of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog.

Kory’s dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah’s first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah’s second dog is half the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weights of all three dogs:
\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Rob received 7 stickers from Kris.
2. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.
3. Kris received these 16 stickers from Luis, who gave him half of what he had after receiving from Seth. This means Luis had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers before giving them to Kris.
4. Luis received these 32 stickers from Seth, who gave him half of what he had. Therefore, Seth originally had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers.

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total weight of M&M's John buys**: John buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces.
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 3 \times 10 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Total number of M&M's**: Each ounce contains 30 M&M's.
   \[
   \text{Total number of M&M's} = 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&M's/ounce} = 900 \text{ M&M's}
   \]

3. **Number of small bags**: Each small bag contains 10 M&M's.
   \[
   \text{Number of small bags} = \frac{900 \text{ M&M's}}{10 \text{ M&M's/bag}} = 90 \text{ bags}
   \]

So, John can make 90 small bags.

"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth, we need to calculate half of the Earth's circumference and then divide that by the distance Alfie flies each day.

The Earth's circumference is 40,000 kilometers, so half of that is:

40,000 kilometers / 2 = 20,000 kilometers

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day, so the number of days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers is:

20,000 kilometers / 400 kilometers/day = 50 days

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Liam is currently 16 years old.
2. Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.
3. At that time, Liam’s age was twice the age of Vince. So, if Vince's age two years ago was \( V \), then:
   \[
   14 = 2V
   \]
4. Solving for \( V \):
   \[
   V = \frac{14}{2} = 7
   \]
5. This means that two years ago, Vince was 7 years old.
6. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age from two years ago:
   \[
   7 + 2 = 9
   \]

Therefore, Vince is currently 9 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total eggs painted by all four**: 56 eggs.
2. **Total eggs painted by Camden and Sarah**: 30 eggs.
3. **Eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline**: Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56, the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline together is \(56 - 30 = 26\) eggs. Since they painted the same number, each of them painted \(26 \div 2 = 13\) eggs.

4. **Eggs painted by Camden and Sarah**:
   - Let \(S\) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.
   - Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so Camden painted \(S + 12\) eggs.
   - Together, they painted 30 eggs, so \(S + (S + 12) = 30\).

5. **Solve for \(S\)**:
   \[
   2S + 12 = 30
   \]
   \[
   2S = 18
   \]
   \[
   S = 9
   \]
   - Sarah painted 9 eggs.
   - Camden painted \(9 + 12 = 21\) eggs.

6. **How many more eggs did Camden paint than Arnold?**:
   - Camden painted 21 eggs.
   - Arnold painted 13 eggs.
   - The difference is \(21 - 13 = 8\).

Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, and then convert that weight into pounds.

First, let's determine how many boxes Nik will need. Since he has 200 crayons and each box holds 8 crayons, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box:

200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce:

200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces

Now, we calculate the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces:

25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives us the total weight in ounces:

200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound:

400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds

"To determine how much John makes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the usable length of the tree.
2. Determine how many 4-foot logs can be made from the usable length.
3. Calculate the total number of planks from the logs.
4. Calculate the total revenue from selling the planks.

**Step 1: Calculate the usable length of the tree.**

The tree is 80 feet tall, and John can use 80% of it for logs. 

Usable length = 80 feet * 80% = 80 feet * 0.8 = 64 feet

**Step 2: Determine how many 4-foot logs can be made from the usable length.**

Each log is 4 feet long, so the number of logs is:

Number of logs = Usable length / Length of each log = 64 feet / 4 feet = 16 logs

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of planks from the logs.**

From each log, John cuts 5 planks. Therefore, the total number of planks is:

Total planks = Number of logs * Planks per log = 16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks

**Step 4: Calculate the total revenue from selling the planks.**

Each plank is sold for $1.2, so the total revenue is:

Total revenue = Total planks * Price per plank = 80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96

Therefore, John makes $96.

   \[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

2. Calculate their combined monthly earnings:
   \[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

3. Determine their mother's monthly earnings:
   Their mother earns twice their combined salary:
   \[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time Grandma spends walking, which includes the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk.

First, let's find Grandma's walking speed on the beach. We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes. To find her speed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

This means Grandma walks 1 mile in 20 minutes on the beach.

Next, we need to find her speed on the sidewalk. We are told that she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is:

\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we need to calculate the time it takes for her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:

\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:

\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

"To determine how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has already saved and then figure out how much more she needs to save.

Jane saves $4 every week. Over the past 8 weeks, she has saved:
\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

She wants to have a total of $60. Therefore, the amount she still needs to save is:
\[ 60 - 32 = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she saves $4 each week, the number of additional weeks required to save $28 is:
\[ \frac{28}{4} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many marbles Bob has initially.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12 marbles, 2 dozen equals 24 marbles. Therefore, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. We can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

To find the initial number of marbles, we subtract 24 from 60:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles.

Next, we need to determine how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 of the marbles he has. We subtract 10 from the initial number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T_2 \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug.
- The final temperature of the mixture as \( T_f \).

Donny mixes 4 ounces of 33-degree water with 1 ounce of \( T_2 \)-degree water. The total volume of the mixture is 5 ounces.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) when mixing two different temperatures is given by:

\[ T_f = \frac{(m_1 \cdot T_1) + (m_2 \cdot T_2)}{m_1 + m_2} \]

Where:
- \( m_1 \) is the mass (or volume) of the first liquid.
- \( T_1 \) is the temperature of the first liquid.
- \( m_2 \) is the mass (or volume) of the second liquid.
- \( T_2 \) is the temperature of the second liquid.

Substituting the given values:
- \( m_1 = 4 \) ounces
- \( T_1 = 33 \) degrees
- \( m_2 = 1 \) ounce
- \( T_2 \) is the unknown temperature
- \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees

We set up the equation:

\[ 40 = \frac{(4 \cdot 33) + (1 \cdot T_2)}{4 + 1} \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 40 = \frac{132 + T_2}{5} \]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the denominator:

\[ 200 = 132 + T_2 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T_2 \):

\[ T_2 = 200 - 132 \]
\[ T_2 = 68 \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is 68 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the increase in the number of cows and chickens and then add these to the initial numbers.

First, let's calculate the increase in the number of cows:
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
- Over three weeks (21 days), the total number of cows added is 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.

Next, let's calculate the increase in the number of chickens:
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.
- Over three weeks (21 days), the total number of chickens added is 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.

Now, let's add these increases to the initial numbers:
- Initial number of cows: 50
- Initial number of chickens: 20

Total number of cows after three weeks:
50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows

Total number of chickens after three weeks:
20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

Finally, let's add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals:
470 (cows) + 230 (chickens) = 700 animals

"To find out how much each single bagel costs after the discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount.
2. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.
3. Calculate the total number of bagels in 4 packs.
4. Divide the discounted total cost by the total number of bagels to find the cost per bagel.

Let's start with step 1:

- Each pack costs $10.00.
- Russell orders 4 packs.

Total cost without discount = 4 packs * $10.00/pack = $40.00

Next, step 2:

- The discount is 10% of the total cost.
- 10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00

Discounted total cost = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Now, step 3:

- Each pack contains 9 bagels.
- Russell orders 4 packs.

Total number of bagels = 4 packs * 9 bagels/pack = 36 bagels

Finally, step 4:

- The discounted total cost is $36.00.
- The total number of bagels is 36.

Cost per bagel = $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00

So, the cost per bagel after the discount is $1.00.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate:
Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops, which is:
23 - 5 = 18 scoops

Next, we need to figure out how many potatoes are used to make the scoops of mashed potatoes. According to the problem, it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Let's break this down:
- 3 less than 6 potatoes is 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes
- 1 less than 3 scoops is 3 - 1 = 2 scoops

So, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops. We can set up a proportion based on the information that 3 potatoes make 2 scoops:
3 potatoes / 2 scoops = x potatoes / 18 scoops

Solving for x:
x = (3 potatoes * 18 scoops) / 2 scoops
x = 54 / 2
x = 27 potatoes

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

For the next 30 days, Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

The total number of eggs Chester eats over the 60 days is:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Chester needs:
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus before any women alight.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 14 passengers (5 men + 9 women), 5 are men and 9 are women.

Given that the total number of passengers is 84, we can find out how many groups of 14 passengers there are on the bus:
\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{84}{14} = 6 \]

Since there are 6 groups of 14 passengers, the number of men and women can be calculated as follows:
- Number of men = 5 men/group * 6 groups = 30 men
- Number of women = 9 women/group * 6 groups = 54 women

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

"To determine the total number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to consider both the individual sunflowers and the sunflowers that are part of the bouquets.

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day:
- Faraday earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers at $2 each.
- The number of individual sunflowers sold per day is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \).

Next, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
- Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets at $8 each.
- The number of bouquets sold per day is \( \frac{56}{8} = 7 \).

Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, so the number of sunflowers sold as part of bouquets per day is:
- \( 7 \text{ bouquets/day} \times 12 \text{ sunflowers/bouquet} = 84 \text{ sunflowers/day} \).

Now, let's find the total number of sunflowers sold per day:
- Total sunflowers sold per day = individual sunflowers + sunflowers in bouquets
- Total sunflowers sold per day = 13 + 84 = 97.

"To find the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probability of winning with the first ticket by the probability of winning with the second ticket.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.20.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning with the second ticket is 3 times 0.20, which is 0.60.

Now, we multiply the probabilities of each event happening:

0.20 (probability of the first ticket winning) * 0.60 (probability of the second ticket winning) = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the duration of the second song and then add it to the duration of the first song.

The first song is 5 minutes long.

The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes is:
0.60 * 5 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is:
5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now, we add the duration of both songs to find the total time of the cassette:
5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total cassette is 13 minutes long.

"To calculate Linus's profit, we first need to determine the selling price of each mobile device and then calculate the total profit from the devices bought on both days.

1. The original price of one mobile device is $20.
2. The selling price of one mobile device is twice the original price, which is $20 * 2 = $40.
3. The profit from selling one mobile device is the selling price minus the original price, which is $40 - $20 = $20.

Next, we calculate the total profit from the devices bought on both days:

- On Monday, Linus bought 2 devices, so the profit from these is 2 * $20 = $40.
- On Tuesday, Linus bought 4 devices, so the profit from these is 4 * $20 = $80.

The total profit from all the devices is the sum of the profits from Monday and Tuesday, which is $40 + $80 = $120.

"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. Let's start with the information given:

1. Isabel is 7 feet tall.
2. Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned is \(7 - 2 = 5\) feet tall.
3. Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so Carl is \(5 + 1 = 6\) feet tall.

Since Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, the length of Carl's cane is \(6 / 2 = 3\) feet.

"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would have to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people:**
   - Each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy needs.
   - Therefore, to cover 100% of a person's daily energy needs, 5 bottles are required (since 100% / 20% = 5 bottles).

2. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed for 2300 people:**
   - Total bottles needed = 2300 people * 5 bottles/person = 11500 bottles.

3. **Determine the current production capacity:**
   - Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.

4. **Calculate the additional number of bottles needed:**
   - Additional bottles needed = Total bottles needed - Current production capacity
   - Additional bottles needed = 11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 bottles.

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce 7300 more bottles to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of octuplets dressed in each color:**
   - Carla has 8 identical octuplets.
   - 3/4 of them are dressed in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \) octuplets.
   - 1/4 of them are dressed in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \) octuplets.

2. **Determine the number of octuplets wearing bows:**
   - All 2 blue-wearers also wear bows.
   - 1/3 of the 6 purple-wearers also wear bows: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) purple-wearers.

3. **Calculate the total number of octuplets wearing bows:**
   - Total number of bow-wearers = 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4 octuplets.

4. **Determine the number of bow-wearers who are wearing purple:**
   - There are 2 purple-wearers who also wear bows.

5. **Calculate the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:**
   - The probability is the number of purple bow-wearers divided by the total number of bow-wearers, multiplied by 100 to get the percentage:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2}{4} \right) \times 100 = 50\%

"To determine how much money Abraham will earn after selling all his unused land, we need to break down the sales step by step.

1. **Initial Land and First Sale:**
   - Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
   - He sells half of it, which is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.
   - He earns $50 from this sale.

2. **Second Sale:**
   - After the first sale, he has \( 80 - 40 = 40 \) square meters left.
   - He then sells \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining land, which is \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) square meters.
   - He earns $30 from this sale.

3. **Remaining Land and Final Sale:**
   - After the second sale, he has \( 40 - 10 = 30 \) square meters left.
   - He sells the remaining 30 square meters at $3 per square meter.
   - The earnings from this sale are \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars.

4. **Total Earnings:**
   - Adding up all the earnings from the sales:
     - First sale: $50
     - Second sale: $30
     - Final sale: $90
   - Total earnings: \( 50 + 30 + 90 = 170 \) dollars.

Therefore, Abraham will be able to earn a total of $170 after selling all his unused land.

"To find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, let's first determine the total number of eggs and then subtract the number of eggs found by each participant.

1. Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen equals:
   \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) eggs.

2. Lamar finds 5 eggs.

3. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so:
   \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) eggs.

4. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so:
   \( 10 - 2 = 8 \) eggs.

5. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so:

"To find out how much money John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
2. Calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.
3. Calculate the total number of collections John makes in a week.
4. Calculate the total amount of money John makes in a week.

Step 1: The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two, so it has:
\[ 400 \times 1.60 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Step 2: The total number of apartments John collects garbage from is:
\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

Step 3: John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, so the total number of collections in a week is:
\[ 1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections} \]

Step 4: John gets paid $0.40 per collection, so the total amount of money he makes in a week is:
\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, John makes $1248 in a week.

"To find the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old avocado tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
3. A 7-year-old avocado tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
4. A 10-year-old avocado tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.
5. An 8-year-old avocado tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one, which is 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
6. During the ninth year, the avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit, so it produces 0 fruits.

Now, we need to sum up the fruits produced from year 5 to year 10, and assume that the tree does not produce any fruits in the first four years:

- Year 1: 0 fruits
- Year 2: 0 fruits
- Year 3: 0 fruits
- Year 4: 0 fruits
- Year 5: 50 fruits
- Year 6: 150 fruits
- Year 7: 350 fruits
- Year 8: 800 fruits
- Year 9: 0 fruits

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters. According to the problem, the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.

The combined length of the three ropes is given as 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ B = 5 \]

Now that we know the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters, we can find the length of the red rope:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Ronnie was given $5.
2. Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

Next, we know that after giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original amount.

3. Let \( x \) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister. After giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars.
4. According to the problem, \( 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \).

Let's solve for \( x \):

\[
15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
\]

\[
15 - x = 12

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The mural is divided into two main parts: half yellow and the other half a mix of red, white, and purple.
2. Since half the mural is yellow, the other half must be divided equally among red, white, and purple.
3. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

First, calculate the amount of yellow paint:
- Half of the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint is \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) pints.

Next, calculate the amount of paint used for the other colors:
- The remaining half of the mural is 6 pints, which is divided equally among red, white, and purple.
- Therefore, each of these colors (red, white, and purple) uses \( \frac{6}{3} = 2 \) pints.

So, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

"To find the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house, and then sum these areas.

1. **Bedrooms**: Each bedroom measures 20 by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:
   \[
   20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ square feet}
   \]
   Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area for the bedrooms is:
   \[
   4 \times 240 = 960 \text{ square feet}

"To determine how many dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box, we first need to calculate the number of pods in the special size box and then find out the cost per pod.

1. Calculate the number of pods in the special size box:
   - The regular box has 100 pods.
   - The special size box has 20% more pods.
   - 20% of 100 pods is \( 100 \times 0.20 = 20 \) pods.
   - Therefore, the special size box has \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. Calculate the cost per pod in the special size box:
   - The special size box costs $12.
   - The number of pods in the special size box is 120.
   - The cost per pod is \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. Determine how many pods you can get for $1:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills. To find out how many $20 bills he has, we divide $1000 by $20:
   \[ \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills} \]

2. He loses 10 of these $20 bills:
   \[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills} \]

3. He uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill:
   \[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills} \]
   So, he has 20 $20 bills left.

4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he has 20 $20 bills, the total amount of money he has is:
   \[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]
   Tripling this amount:
   \[ 400 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ dollars} \]

5. He then converts all his money into $5 bills. To find out how many $5 bills he has, we divide $1200 by $5:

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, let's expand the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5C + 35}{3} \]
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider both the rate at which Jay makes snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay makes 20 snowballs per hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this means he makes \( \frac{20}{60} = \frac{1}{3} \) of a snowball per minute.

Every 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt. This means that the melting rate is \( \frac{2}{15} \) snowballs per minute.

The net rate of snowball accumulation is the difference between the making rate and the melting rate:
\[ \text{Net rate} = \frac{1}{3} - \frac{2}{15} = \frac{5}{15} - \frac{2}{15} = \frac{3}{15} = \frac{1}{5} \text{ snowballs per minute} \]

To find out how long it will take to accumulate 60 snowballs at this net rate, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total snowballs needed}}{\text{Net rate}} = \frac{60}{\frac{1}{5}} = 60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Converting 300 minutes into hours:
\[ 300 \text{ minutes} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the year Digimon came out:**
   - Digimon had its 20th anniversary, which means it came out 20 years ago.
   - If the current year is 2023, then Digimon came out in 2023 - 20 = 2003.

2. **Determine John's age when Digimon came out:**
   - John is 28 years old now (in 2023).
   - Therefore, in 2003, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

3. **Determine Jim's age when Digimon came out:**
   - When Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - If John was 8 years old, then Jim was 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

4. **Determine Jim's current age:**
   - Since 20 years have passed since 2003, Jim's current age is 4 + 20 = 24 years old.

So, Jim is 24 years old now.

"To determine how many bandages the nurses' station started with on the first day, we can work backwards from the information provided.

1. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered 2 bulk packs, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.
   - They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

   Therefore, the total number of bandages at the start of the third day before using any is:
   \[
   78 + 25 = 103 \text{ bandages}
   \]

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
   - They did not order any new bandages on the second day.

   Therefore, the total number of bandages at the start of the second day before using any is:
   \[
   103 + 28 = 131 \text{ bandages}
   \]

3. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack, which is 50 bandages.

   Therefore, the total number of bandages at the start of the first day before using any is:
   \[
   131 + 38 - 50 = 119 \text{ bandages}
   \]

Thus, the nurses' station started with 119 bandages on the first day.

"To find the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut based on the length of hair cut off and add the cost of the hair color.

1. Calculate the length of hair cut off: May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so the length cut off is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.
2. Calculate the cost of the haircut: The cost is $30 per inch, so for 2 inches, the cost is 2 * $30 = $60.
3. Add the cost of the hair color: The color costs $40.

Total cost = Cost of haircut + Cost of color = $60 + $40 = $100.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider both her hourly wage and her attendance bonus.

First, we calculate her earnings from her hourly wage:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her weekly earnings from her hourly wage are:
7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * $1.5/hour = 67.5 hours/week * $1.5/hour = $101.25/week

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her monthly earnings from her hourly wage are:
$101.25/week * 4 weeks = $405

Next, we add her attendance bonus:
- Jen receives an additional $10 for complete attendance each week.
- Since she had no absences for all 4 weeks, she receives the bonus for each week.

So, her total attendance bonus for April is:
$10/week * 4 weeks = $40

Now, we add her earnings from her hourly wage and her attendance bonus to find her total earnings for April:
$405 (hourly wage) + $40 (attendance bonus) = $445

Therefore, Jen will receive $445 in April.

"To calculate how much money Jason earned, we need to multiply the amount he earns for each task by the number of times he completed the task and then sum these amounts.

- Laundry: $3.00 * 1 = $3.00
- Cleaning his room: $1.50 * 1 = $1.50
- Taking the trash out: $0.75 * 2 = $1.50
- Emptying the dishwasher: $0.50 * 6 = $3.00

Now, we add up all the amounts:

$3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (cleaning room) + $1.50 (trash) + $3.00 (dishwasher) = $9.00

So, Jason earned a total of $9.00 in the two-week period.

"To find the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, we can break down the problem into parts and add the numbers together.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first (in the morning) had entered the restaurant, which is 3 * 50 = 150 people.

Now, we add all these numbers together to get the total number of people:

50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) + 80 (after a while) + 150 (evening) = 320

"To find out how many pens Alain has, we need to calculate the total number of red and black pens.

First, we know that Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens. So, the total number of red pens is:
5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens

Next, she bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens. Since there are 5 packs of red pens, she bought:
2 * 5 packs = 10 packs of black pens

Each pack of black pens also has 5 pens, so the total number of black pens is:
10 packs * 5 pens/pack = 50 black pens

Now, to find the total number of pens, we add the number of red pens and black pens together:
25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens

Therefore, Alain has 75 pens in total.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cost of Scotch:**
   - John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600.
   - Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:
     \[
     \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Number of Bottles of Cognac:**
   - John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch.
   - Therefore, the number of bottles of cognac is:
     \[
     2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles}
     \]

3. **Cost per Bottle of Cognac:**
   - The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch.
   - Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:
     \[
     60 + (0.5 \times 60) = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Total Cost of Cognac:**
   - The total cost for 20 bottles of cognac is:
     \[
     20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **First Day Planting:**
   - Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
   - He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees. Therefore, he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

2. **Second Day Planting:**
   - On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees. So, the total number of White Oak trees planted on the second day is \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
   - He planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he did on the first day. So, the number of additional Lodgepole Pine trees is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \) more trees.
   - Therefore, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is \(40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

3. **Total Trees Planted:**
   - Total White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\)
   - Total Lodgepole Pine trees: \(40 + 50 = 90\)

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge as \( m \).

The problem states that ""eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" is equal to 40. This can be written as:
\[ 4m + 8 = 40 \]

Next, we solve for \( m \):

1. Subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4m + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4m = 32 \]

2. Divide both sides by 4:
\[ \frac{4m}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ m = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 8.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many fish have red stripes and then how many of the remaining fish have blue stripes.

1. Calculate the number of fish with red stripes:
   - One-third of the fish have red stripes, so we calculate \( \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \) fish with red stripes.

2. Calculate the number of remaining fish:
   - After removing the fish with red stripes, there are \( 66 - 22 = 44 \) fish left.

3. Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish:
   - \( \frac{5}{11} \) of the remaining 44 fish have blue stripes, so we calculate \( \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \) fish with blue stripes.

4. Add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes to get the total:
   - \( 22 + 20 = 42 \)

Therefore, the total number of fish that have either red stripes or blue stripes is 42.

"To determine how many eyeshadow colors Amy has left, let's break down the information:

- Amy originally had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, which totals:
  \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors from the palettes.

- She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, which totals:
  \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors from the makeup sets.

- Her sister steals one of the palettes, so Amy loses 4 colors:
  \(8 - 4 = 4\) colors left from the palettes.

- Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. One makeup set has 6 colors, so half of these colors is:
  \(6 \div 2 = 3\) colors used.

- Therefore, the number of colors left from the makeup sets is:
  \(18 - 3 = 15\) colors.

- Adding the remaining colors from the palettes and the makeup sets gives:
  \(4 + 15 = 19\) colors.

So, Amy has 19 eyeshadow colors left.

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information about the average distance walked by the dogs. The average distance walked by the 4 dogs is 3 miles per day. This means the total distance walked by all 4 dogs combined is 4 dogs * 3 miles/dog = 12 miles.

We know the distances for the first three dogs:
- The first dog walks 1 mile.
- The second dog walks 4 miles.
- The third dog walks 3 miles.

Adding these distances together gives us 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

To find the distance the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total distance walked by the first three dogs from the total distance all four dogs need to walk:
12 miles (total) - 8 miles (first three dogs) = 4 miles.

The last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we first need to determine the capacity of the classes in each school.

Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students. Since Ali is the dean of a private school and teaches only one class, the capacity of the private school is 120 students.

John's school, a public school, has two classes, each with a capacity that is 1/8 of Ali's class. Therefore, the capacity of each of John's classes is:

120 students / 8 = 15 students

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for his school is:

15 students/class * 2 classes = 30 students

Now, to find the combined capacity of both schools, we add the capacities together:

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to calculate the total number of jelly beans he estimated and then find out how many of those he thought were red. We can then compare this to the true number of red jelly beans, which is 900.

First, let's calculate the volume of the jar:
\[ \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \, \text{inches} \times 6 \, \text{inches} \times 15 \, \text{inches} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

Next, we account for the packing efficiency:
\[ \text{Effective volume for jelly beans} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches} \times 0.80 = 432 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar:
\[ \text{Total number of jelly beans} = \frac{\text{Effective volume for jelly beans}}{\text{Volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432 \, \text{cubic inches}}{0.15 \, \text{cubic inches per jelly bean}} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans} \]

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red:
\[ \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans} \times 0.30 = 864 \, \text{red jelly beans} \]

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we calculate the difference:
\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

So, Tim's guess was off by 36 red jelly beans.

"To determine how much Pauline spent on all her visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost of visits before the price increase and the cost of visits after the price increase.

1. **Cost of visits before the price increase:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - The cost of one visit is $2.
   - She visits the museum for 5 years.
   - Total cost for 5 years = 3 visits/year * $2/visit * 5 years = $30.

2. **Cost of visits after the price increase:**

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece, which is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, is:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To determine how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning he will need, we first need to figure out how many pounds of ground beef he will use to make 80 meatballs.

Given that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can calculate the number of pounds needed for 80 meatballs as follows:

\[ \text{Number of pounds} = \frac{\text{Total number of meatballs}}{\text{Number of meatballs per pound}} \]
\[ \text{Number of pounds} = \frac{80}{16} = 5 \]

Now that we know Aiden will use 5 pounds of ground beef, we can calculate the amount of seasoning needed. He uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef, so for 5 pounds, he will need:

\[ \text{Total seasoning} = \text{Number of pounds} \times \text{Tablespoons of seasoning per pound} \]
\[ \text{Total seasoning} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning.

"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call with the given pricing structure, we need to break the call into two segments: the first 16 minutes and the remaining minutes after the price drops.

1. For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute:
   \( 16 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.25/\text{minute} = \$4.00 \)

2. For the remaining 20 minutes (36 minutes total - 16 minutes), the cost is $0.20 per minute:
   \( 20 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.20/\text{minute} = \$4.00 \)

3. Adding the costs of both segments together gives the total cost of the call:
   \( \$4.00 + \$4.00 = \$8.00 \)

The total cost of a 36-minute call is $8.00.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of treats needed:**
   - Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats.
   - Total treats needed = 5 people * 2 treats/person = 10 treats.

2. **Set up the relationship between the number of cupcakes and brownies:**
   - Let \( c \) be the number of cupcakes.
   - According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.
   - Therefore, the number of brownies \( b \) can be expressed as: \( b = 3c - 2 \).

3. **Set up the equation for the total number of treats:**
   - The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and the number of brownies.
   - Total treats = \( c + b \).
   - Substitute \( b \) with \( 3c - 2 \):
     \[
     c + (3c - 2) = 10
     \]

4. **Solve the equation:**
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     c + 3c - 2 = 10
     \]
     \[
     4c - 2 = 10
     \]
   - Add 2 to both sides:
     \[
     4c = 12
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 4:
     \[
     c = 3
     \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"To calculate the total cost for Karen, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of a manicure and a pedicure with the 20% discount.
2. Calculate the cost of the nail art.
3. Add the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art.

First, let's find the combined cost of the manicure and pedicure before the discount:
- Manicure: $35
- Pedicure: $40
- Combined cost: $35 + $40 = $75

Now, apply the 20% discount to the combined cost:
- Discount: 20% of $75 = 0.20 * $75 = $15
- Discounted cost: $75 - $15 = $60

Next, calculate the cost of the nail art. Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, which means 10 nails in total:
- Cost per nail: $3
- Total cost for nail art: 10 * $3 = $30

Finally, add the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art:
- Total cost: $60 + $30 = $90

Therefore, Karen would pay $90 in all.

"To find out how many paintings Kim has, we can start by setting up the relationships described in the problem with the information given.

Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as \( K \).

According to the problem, Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, so we can express the number of paintings Shelley has as \( K + 8 \).

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and we know that Samantha has 27 paintings. Therefore, we can express the number of paintings Samantha has as \( (K + 8) - 12 \).

Since we know Samantha has 27 paintings, we can set up the equation:

\[ (K + 8) - 12 = 27 \]

Solving for \( K \):

\[ K + 8 - 12 = 27 \]
\[ K - 4 = 27 \]
\[ K = 27 + 4 \]
\[ K = 31 \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings.

"To find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we need to calculate the total distance he has traveled and then compare it to the total distance.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael has traveled in 3 days. Since he is traveling at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we need to know how many hours he travels in 3 days.

There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, there are:
3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance he has traveled:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours = 3600 km

Now, we have the distance Michael has traveled (3600 km) and the total distance between Alaska and Texas (6000 km). To find the percentage of the distance he has covered, we use the formula:

Percentage covered = (Distance traveled / Total distance) * 100

Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage covered = 0.6 * 100
Percentage covered = 60%

So, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

"To find out how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the weekly cost and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

First, let's calculate the weekly cost:
- The cost of the pasta is $1.00 per box.
- The cost of the cheddar cheese is $3.00.
- The cost of the gruyere cheese is twice the cost of the cheddar cheese, which is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00.

Now, we add these costs together to get the total weekly cost:
- Total weekly cost = Cost of pasta + Cost of cheddar cheese + Cost of gruyere cheese
- Total weekly cost = $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00
- Total weekly cost = $10.00

Next, we calculate the yearly cost by multiplying the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year (52 weeks):
- Yearly cost = Total weekly cost * Number of weeks in a year
- Yearly cost = $10.00 * 52
- Yearly cost = $520.00

Therefore, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year.

"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test to move on to the 7th grade, we need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly across both tests, and then see how many more she needs to reach that total.

First, let's calculate the total number of questions across both tests:
- The first test has 70 questions.
- The second test has 40 questions.
- Total questions = 70 + 40 = 110 questions.

Next, we calculate the number of questions she needs to answer correctly to pass, which is 70% of the total questions:
- 70% of 110 = 0.70 * 110 = 77 questions.

Now, we need to find out how many questions Audrey got right on the first test:
- She got 60% of the 70 questions correct.
- 60% of 70 = 0.60 * 70 = 42 questions.

To find out how many more questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she already got right from the total number of questions she needs to get right:
- Questions needed to pass = 77
- Questions already correct = 42

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which can be written as:

\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can write:

\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation, we get:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6, we find:

\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting \( S \) back into the equation for \( B \):

\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

"To solve this, let's break down the time John takes for each side of the Rubik's cube:

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first, so they each take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes.
- The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first, so they each take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

"To find out how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish, we need to calculate the total drying time for both the old and new varnishes and then find the difference.

First, we calculate the total drying time for the old varnish:
- Time for one painting to dry with the old varnish: 7 minutes
- Total drying time for 6 paintings with the old varnish: 7 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 42 minutes

Next, we calculate the total drying time for the new varnish:
- Time for one painting to dry with the new varnish: 12 minutes
- Total drying time for 6 paintings with the new varnish: 12 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 72 minutes

Now, we find the difference in drying time:
- Difference in drying time: 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes

Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish.

"To determine the total amount of water Crista needs for her plants every day, we can break down the calculation by the different water requirements of the plants.

1. **Plants needing half a cup of water:**
   - Number of plants: 4
   - Water needed per plant: 0.5 cups
   - Total water for these plants: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2\) cups

2. **Plants needing one cup of water:**
   - Number of plants: 8
   - Water needed per plant: 1 cup
   - Total water for these plants: \(8 \times 1 = 8\) cups

3. **Plants needing a quarter of a cup of water:**
   - Total number of plants: 20
   - Number of plants already accounted for: 4 + 8 = 12
   - Number of remaining plants: \(20 - 12 = 8\)
   - Water needed per plant: 0.25 cups
   - Total water for these plants: \(8 \times 0.25 = 2\) cups

"To determine how long it will take Phineas Frog to return home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to travel both the land and water portions of his journey.

First, we need to find the distance Phineas needs to travel on land and in water. Since the total distance is 200 yards and half of it is on land and the other half in water, we can divide the total distance by 2:

- Distance on land: 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards
- Distance in water: 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each part of the journey:

- Time on land: Distance on land / Speed on land = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes
- Time in water: Distance in water / Speed in water = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Finally, we add the times together to get the total time:

- Total time = Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

Therefore, it will take Phineas 15 minutes to return home.

"To determine how long it would take John to speak 10 pages after his training, we first need to calculate his new speaking speed and then the total number of words he needs to speak.

1. **Calculate the new speaking speed:**
   - John's original speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM).
   - After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster.
   - New speaking speed = 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM.

2. **Calculate the total number of words in 10 pages:**
   - Each page has 450 words.
   - Total words in 10 pages = 450 words/page * 10 pages = 4500 words.

3. **Calculate the time it takes to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM:**
   - Time (in minutes) = Total words / Speaking speed
   - Time = 4500 words / 375 WPM = 12 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **First Day**: Conor saw 50 people.
2. **Second Day**: 20 more people than the first day, so:
   \[
   50 + 20 = 70 \text{ people}
   \]
3. **Third Day**: Twice the number of people as the second day, so:
   \[
   2 \times 70 = 140 \text{ people}
   \]
4. **Rest of the Week (4 days)**: Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Therefore, the total number of people he saw over these 4 days is:
   \[
   60 \times 4 = 240 \text{ people}
   \]

Now, we sum up the total number of people Conor saw over the entire week:

"To find out how many pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat, let's break down the popping process into the four 30-second intervals and the residual popping after the heat is turned off.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
3. In the following 30 seconds, four times the initial amount pop, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so 80 / 2 = 40 kernels pop.
5. After the heat is turned off, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, let's add up all the kernels that popped:

20 (first 30 seconds) + 60 (second 30 seconds) + 80 (third 30 seconds) + 40 (fourth 30 seconds) + 10 (residual popping) = 210

So, Garrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to eat.

"To determine how many lemons Tim will need, let's break down the requirements:

1. For the pool party, Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade. Since 1 gallon of lemonade requires 1 cup of lemon juice, 4 gallons will require 4 cups of lemon juice.
2. Each cup of lemon juice requires 6 lemons, so 4 cups will require \(4 \times 6 = 24\) lemons.

3. For Allen, Tim needs to make 1 gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart. This means it will require twice the amount of lemon juice, so 2 cups of lemon juice.
4. Since 1 cup of lemon juice requires 6 lemons, 2 cups will require \(2 \times 6 = 12\) lemons.

Adding the lemons needed for the pool party and the extra gallon for Allen, Tim will need \(24 + 12 = 36\) lemons in total.

"To find out how much Helen paid for her hotel and bus travels during her trip through Germany, we need to calculate the costs for both the hotel and the bus rides.

First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel:
- Helen stayed for 3 nights.
- The cost of one night at the hotel is $80.
- Therefore, the total cost for the hotel is 3 nights * $80/night = $240.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the bus rides:
- Helen rode the bus 7 times.
- Each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel.
- The cost of one bus trip is 10% of $80, which is 0.10 * $80 = $8.
- Therefore, the total cost for the bus rides is 7 trips * $8/trip = $56.

Now, we add the total cost of the hotel and the total cost of the bus rides to find the total amount Helen paid:
- Total cost = Cost of hotel + Cost of bus rides = $240 + $56 = $296.

Helen paid $296 for the hotel and bus travels during her trip.

"To find out how much time Charisma has spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time spent on meditation:
- Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so that's 15 minutes * 2 = 30 minutes per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she meditates for 30 minutes * 7 days = 210 minutes.
- In 4 weeks, she will meditate for 210 minutes * 4 = 840 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on yoga:
- Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour, 5 days a week. 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes.
- In one week, she practices yoga for 60 minutes * 5 days = 300 minutes.
- In 4 weeks, she will practice yoga for 300 minutes * 4 = 1200 minutes.

Now, let's add the time spent on meditation and yoga together:
- Total time spent = 840 minutes (meditation) + 1200 minutes (yoga) = 2040 minutes.

To convert the total time into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
- 2040 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 34 hours.

"To find the total square footage of the quilt, we need to multiply the number of shirts of each size by their respective square footage and then add all the results together.

For the small shirts:
11 small shirts * 3 square feet per shirt = 33 square feet

For the medium shirts:
8 medium shirts * 4 square feet per shirt = 32 square feet

For the large shirts:
6 large shirts * 6 square feet per shirt = 36 square feet

Now, we add the square footage of all the shirts together:
33 square feet + 32 square feet + 36 square feet = 101 square feet

The quilt will be 101 square feet.

"To find the total number of sunflower seeds, we first need to calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower and then the number of seeds in a large sunflower.

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen equals 12, the small sunflower has:
3 dozen * 12 seeds/dozen = 36 seeds

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of the small sunflower's seeds:
50% of 36 seeds = 0.5 * 36 seeds = 18 seeds

So, the large sunflower has:
36 seeds + 18 seeds = 54 seeds

To find the total number of seeds in both the small and large sunflower, we add the seeds together:
36 seeds + 54 seeds = 90 seeds

"To find out how tall Jackie was before summer, let's break down the information step by step:

1. Albert's height is 36 inches.
2. Anne is twice the size of Albert, so Anne's height is \( 36 \times 2 = 72 \) inches.
3. Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne, so Jackie's current height is \( 72 - 2 = 70 \) inches.
4. Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer, so her height before the summer was \( 70 - 3 = 67 \) inches.

Therefore, Jackie was 67 inches tall before the summer.

"To calculate the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to consider the discounts on both the T-shirts and the shoes.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts with the buy one get one 50% off deal:
- The original price of each T-shirt is $8.
- For the first T-shirt, Jake pays the full price: $8.
- For the second T-shirt, Jake pays 50% of the original price: $8 * 0.5 = $4.

So, the total cost for the T-shirts is:
$8 (first T-shirt) + $4 (second T-shirt) = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes with the 40% discount:
- The original price of the shoes is $40.
- The discount is 40%, so Jake pays 60% of the original price: $40 * 0.6 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends:
$12 (T-shirts) + $24 (shoes) = $36.

Therefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is:
$36."
"First, let's calculate how much allowance Ryan has earned over 3 weeks. Since he earns $6 each week, we multiply $6 by 3:

\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

So, Ryan has $18.

Next, we calculate the cost of the ice cream cones. Ryan bought ice cream for himself and 3 friends, which is a total of 4 ice cream cones. Each ice cream cone costs $1.25, so we multiply $1.25 by 4:

\[ 1.25 \times 4 = 5 \]

So, the total cost for the ice cream cones is $5.

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total allowance to find out how much money he has left:

\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \]

Ryan has $13 left.

Finally, we need to determine how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining $13. Each movie ticket costs $6.50, so we divide $13 by $6.50:

\[ 13 \div 6.50 = 2 \]

Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.

"To calculate the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his special honey and jam mix, we first need to determine the cost to produce one jar and then the total cost for 10 jars. After that, we can calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars and subtract the total cost to find the profit.

1. **Cost to produce one jar:**
   - Passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
   - Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
   - Honey: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20
   - Total cost for one jar = $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

2. **Total cost for 10 jars:**
   - Total cost for 10 jars = 10 * $44 = $440

3. **Total revenue from selling 10 jars:**
   - Selling price per jar = $50
   - Total revenue = 10 * $50 = $500

4. **Profit from selling 10 jars:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Profit = $500 - $440 = $60

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation:**
   - The dog digs 6 holes a day.
   - Nate is on vacation for 14 days.
   - Total holes dug = 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.

2. **Determine the net number of holes filled each day after Nate returns:**
   - Nate fills 9 holes a day.
   - The dog digs 6 new holes each night.
   - Net holes filled per day = 9 holes filled - 6 holes dug = 3 holes filled per day.

3. **Calculate the number of days it takes to fill all the holes:**
   - Total holes to fill = 84 holes.
   - Net holes filled per day = 3 holes/day.
   - Number of days to fill all holes = 84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days.

4. **Convert the number of days into weeks:**
   - 1 week = 7 days.
   - Number of weeks = 28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks.

Therefore, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Given that Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students, and Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students, we can calculate Butler High School's enrollment as follows:

\[ \text{Butler High School enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 \]

\[ \text{Butler High School enrollment} = 3000 \]

Now, to find out how much greater the enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract Butler High School's enrollment from Norman High School's enrollment:

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 4000 - 3000 \]

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 1000 \]

1. Dr. Grumpus requested:
   - 16 test tubes
   - 7 beakers
   - 14 Petri dishes

2. Igor gathered:
   - Half as many test tubes as requested: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes
   - Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes
   - The correct number of beakers: 7 beakers

3. Total items Igor placed on the lab bench: 29

Let's denote the number of beakers Igor lost as \( x \). Therefore, the number of beakers Igor actually placed on the lab bench is \( 7 - x \).

Now, we can set up the equation for the total number of items on the lab bench:

\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29 \]
\[ 31 - x = 29 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 31 - 29 = x \]
\[ x = 2 \]

So, Igor lost 2 beakers.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in one hour and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of oranges each person can peel in one hour.

- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange. Therefore, in one hour (60 minutes), she can peel:
  \[
  \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

1. Each chicken has 2 legs, and each cow has 4 legs.
2. The total number of animals is 20, so we have:
   \[
   C + K = 20
   \]
3. The total number of legs is 70, so we have:
   \[
   2C + 4K = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[
C + 2K = 35
\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
C + K = 20 \\
C + 2K = 35
\end{cases}
\]

To solve for \( C \) and \( K \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20
\]
\[
K = 15
\]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[
C + 15 = 20
\]
\[
C = 5
\]

So, the number of chickens is 5.
