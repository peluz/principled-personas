"To determine the total number of bolts needed for a robe, we need to add the bolts of blue fiber and the bolts of white fiber together.

- The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.
- It requires half as much white fiber as blue fiber, which means it needs 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

Adding these together:

2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts in total.

"To determine Josh's profit, we first need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150% of the original purchase price.

1. Calculate the increase in value:
   150% of $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000

2. Add the increase in value to the original purchase price to find the new value of the house:
   $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

3. Calculate the total cost of the house including the purchase price and the repairs:
   $80,000 (purchase price) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000

4. Subtract the total cost from the new value of the house to find the profit:
   $200,000 (new value) - $130,000 (total cost) = $70,000

Therefore, Josh's profit is $70,000.

"To find out how many total meters James runs a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints he does each session by the distance of each sprint, and then multiply that by the number of times he runs per week.

He runs 3 sprints each session, and each sprint is 60 meters. So for each session, he runs:

3 sprints/session * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/session

Since he runs 3 times a week, the total distance he runs in a week is:

180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

So, the total meters James runs a week is:

540"
"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed required for the entire day for all her chickens.

Each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per day. With 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
\[ 3 \text{ cups/chicken/day} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups/day} \]

Next, we need to account for the feed already given during the morning and afternoon meals:
- Morning meal: 15 cups
- Afternoon meal: 25 cups

The total feed given by the end of the afternoon is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how many cups of feed are needed for the final meal, we subtract the total feed already given from the total daily requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To calculate the total cost for 16 glasses where every second glass is 60% of the price, we can break down the purchase into pairs of glasses. Each pair consists of one full-price glass and one discounted glass.

1. The cost of one full-price glass is $5.
2. The cost of one discounted glass is 60% of $5, which is $5 * 0.60 = $3.

For each pair of glasses, the total cost is:
$5 (full price) + $3 (discounted price) = $8.

Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, he is buying 8 pairs of glasses. The total cost for 8 pairs is:
8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

"To determine the total time it takes for Carla to download the 200 GB file, we need to account for the time spent downloading before the restart, the time lost due to the restart, and the time to download the file again from the beginning.

1. **Time to download 40% of the file:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 200 \times 0.40 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, downloading 80 GB takes \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Time lost due to the restart:**
   - The restart takes 20 minutes.

3. **Time to download the file again:**
   - Since the download has to start from the beginning, the entire 200 GB needs to be downloaded again.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, downloading 200 GB takes \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) minutes.

4. **Total time:**
   - Total time = Time to download 40% + Time lost due to restart + Time to download the file again
   - Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 100 minutes = 160 minutes

"To determine how far John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled away from home and then subtract the distance he traveled back towards home.

1. **Distance traveled away from home:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Distance traveled back towards home:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles.
   - For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - For the remaining 1.5 hours (since 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours), he drives at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total distance traveled back towards home:**
   - Total distance = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

4. **Net distance from home:**
   - Net distance = Distance away from home - Distance back towards home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

John is 45 miles from home at the end of the 4 hours.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to consider both her regular pay for the first 40 hours and her overtime pay for the additional hours she worked.

1. Calculate the regular pay for the first 40 hours:
   Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

2. Calculate the number of overtime hours:
   Overtime hours = Total hours worked - Regular hours = 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours

3. Calculate the overtime pay rate:
   Overtime pay rate = Regular hourly rate * 1.2 = $10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour

4. Calculate the total overtime pay:
   Overtime pay = Overtime hours * Overtime pay rate = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

5. Calculate the total earnings for the week:
   Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460.

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. First month: 60 downloads.
2. Second month: The number of downloads is three times the first month, so 60 * 3 = 180 downloads.
3. Third month: The number of downloads is reduced by 30% from the second month. A 30% reduction means the program retains 70% of the second month's downloads. So, 180 * 0.7 = 126 downloads.

Now, we add the downloads from all three months to get the total:

60 (first month) + 180 (second month) + 126 (third month) = 366 downloads.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit per year and see when the total profit exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: $90
2. **Annual Income from Lemons**: 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5
3. **Annual Cost for Watering and Feeding**: $3

**Net Annual Profit**:
\[ \text{Net Annual Profit} = \text{Annual Income} - \text{Annual Cost} \]
\[ \text{Net Annual Profit} = \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5 \]

To find out how many years it will take to recover the initial cost:
\[ \text{Number of Years} = \frac{\text{Initial Cost}}{\text{Net Annual Profit}} \]
\[ \text{Number of Years} = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12 \]

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"To determine how many vacuum cleaners Melanie started with, we can work backwards from the information given.

1. Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left after selling half of what was left at the orange house. This means that before selling at the orange house, she had 5 * 2 = 10 vacuum cleaners.

2. Before selling at the orange house, she had 10 vacuum cleaners, which is after selling 2 more to the red house. So, before selling to the red house, she had 10 + 2 = 12 vacuum cleaners.

3. The 12 vacuum cleaners represent the amount left after selling a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. If 12 is two-thirds of the original amount (since she sold a third at the green house), then the original amount is 12 * (3/2) = 18 vacuum cleaners.

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we first need to calculate the total time she should take to complete the 12-mile trail.

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given that Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour over a 12-mile trail, we can set up the equation:
\[ 4 = \frac{12}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Solving for Total Time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already taken 2 hours to walk the first 6 miles (1 hour for the first 4 miles and another hour for the next 2 miles). Therefore, she has 1 hour left to complete the remaining 6 miles.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, we use the formula for speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in both the orange drink and the pineapple drink, and then sum these amounts after accounting for the spill.

First, let's calculate the amount of water in the orange drink:
- The orange drink is 10 liters, and two-thirds of it is water.
- Therefore, the amount of water in the orange drink is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \) liters.

Since 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, the remaining amount of orange drink is 9 liters. The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:
- \( \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \) liters.

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink:
- The pineapple drink is 15 liters, and three-fifths of it is water.
- Therefore, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \) liters.

Now, we add the amounts of water from both drinks:
- Water from the remaining orange drink: 6 liters
- Water from the pineapple drink: 9 liters

The total amount of water in the 24 liters of mixed drink is:
- \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) liters.

"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Raymond's current age.
2. Calculate the age of Raymond when his son was born.
3. Subtract the age of Raymond when his son was born from his current age to find out how many years ago his son was born.

First, we know that Samantha is 31 years old and Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha. So, Raymond's current age is:

31 (Samantha's age) + 6 (years older than Samantha) = 37 years old.

Raymond had his son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract the age Raymond was when his son was born from his current age:

37 (Raymond's current age) - 23 (age when his son was born) = 14 years ago.

So, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.

"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday, we can break down the sales by the number of DVDs each group of customers bought:

- The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so that's 3 customers * 1 DVD/customer = 3 DVDs.
- The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so that's 2 customers * 2 DVDs/customer = 4 DVDs.
- The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so that's 3 customers * 0 DVDs/customer = 0 DVDs.

Now, we add up all the DVDs sold:

3 DVDs + 4 DVDs + 0 DVDs = 7 DVDs

Therefore, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

"To find the original price of the book, we can set up the equation based on the information that Kyle bought the book at a 25% discount. If \( P \) is the original price, then the price Kyle paid is 75% of \( P \) (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

The equation is:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]
\[ P = 26.00 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to calculate the total cost of the other items she bought and then subtract that from the total amount she paid. After that, we can divide the remaining amount by the cost of one box of pizza to find out how many boxes she ordered.

First, let's calculate the cost of the chicken meal, the milk, and the apples:

- The chicken meal costs $12.
- The 5 packs of milk cost 5 * $3 = $15.
- The 4 apples cost 4 * $1.50 = $6.

Now, let's add up these costs:

$12 (chicken meal) + $15 (milk) + $6 (apples) = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50, so the amount spent on pizza is:

$50 (total) - $33 (other items) = $17.

Now, we divide the amount spent on pizza by the cost of one box to find out how many boxes she ordered:

$17 / $8.50 (cost per box) = 2.

Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

Step 1: Total servings consumed in 60 days
Cynthia eats 1 serving per day, so in 60 days, she will eat:
1 serving/day * 60 days = 60 servings

Step 2: Number of cartons needed
Each carton contains 15 servings, so the number of cartons needed is:
60 servings / 15 servings/carton = 4 cartons

Step 3: Total cost
Each carton costs $4.00, so the total cost for 4 cartons is:
4 cartons * $4.00/carton = $16.00

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to consider the distances given:

- The total trip is 60 miles.
- The first stop was after 20 miles.
- The second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, which means it was at the 45-mile mark (60 miles - 15 miles = 45 miles).

The distance between the first and second stops is the difference between the distance at the second stop and the distance at the first stop:

45 miles - 20 miles = 25 miles

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

"To find the cost of the boots, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pairs of high heels. One pair of heels costs $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, which is $33 * 2 = $66.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots, we can set up the following equation to find the cost of the boots:

Cost of boots = Cost of two pairs of high heels + $5

Cost of boots = $99 + $5 = $104

Therefore, the boots cost $104.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and their total age.

The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11. This means that for every 7 units of Darrell's age, Allen's age is 11 units. Together, these units add up to 162, which is their total age.

Let's denote Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The equation for their total age is:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combine like terms:
\[18x = 162\]

Solve for \(x\):
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we can find their current ages:
- Darrell's age = \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)
- Allen's age = \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109.

"To find the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to first determine what each friend guessed and then calculate the average of those guesses.

1. The first friend guessed 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guessed 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guessed 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 80 + 20, which is 100.

Now, we add up all the guesses and divide by the number of guesses to find the average:

80 (first guess) + 60 (second guess) + 100 (third guess) = 240

To find the average:

240 / 3 = 80

The average guess is 80.

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:

\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( S \):

\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:

\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To find out how many total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the second 20 minutes and then add them to the points he scored in the first 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4 points:
25% of 4 = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 1 point more than the 4 points he scored in the first 20 minutes:
4 points + 1 point = 5 points

Now, we add the points from both periods to get the total points:
4 points (first 20 minutes) + 5 points (second 20 minutes) = 9 points

2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts

Step 2: Cost per yogurt
The sale price is 4 yogurts for $5.00, so the cost per yogurt is:
$5.00 / 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt

Step 3: Total cost for 30 days
The total cost for 60 yogurts is:
60 yogurts * $1.25 per yogurt = $75.00

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

"John initially has 13 lego sets. After selling them, he uses the money to buy video games and has $5 left. To find out how many lego sets he still has, we need to determine if he sold all of them or not.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets:
13 lego sets * $15 per set = $195

Next, we calculate the total cost of the video games he buys:
8 video games * $20 per game = $160

John has $5 left after buying the video games, so the total amount of money he spent is:
$160 (cost of video games) + $5 (leftover) = $165

Since the total amount of money John had after selling his lego sets is $195 and he spent $165, this means he did indeed sell all his lego sets.

Therefore, the number of lego sets John still has is:
0

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his average speed. Speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time.

John runs 60 miles a week over 3 days. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. On the other two days, he runs for half as much time, which is 1.5 hours each day.

First, let's calculate the total time he spends running in a week:
- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: 1.5 hours
- Third day: 1.5 hours

Total time = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours

Now, we can calculate his average speed:
- Total distance = 60 miles
- Total time = 6 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine Dana's walking and running speeds based on the information given about her skipping speed.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - We know that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and this is half as fast as she can run.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk.
   - If her running speed is 6 miles per hour, then her walking speed is \(6 \div 4 = 1.5\) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking over a total of 6 hours.
   - Time spent running: \(6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2\) hours.
   - Time spent walking: \(6 \times \frac{2}{3} = 4\) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running and walking:**
   - Distance while running: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 6 \text{ miles per hour} = 12\) miles.
   - Distance while walking: \(4 \text{ hours} \times 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} = 6\) miles.

5. **Total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking = \(12 + 6 = 18\) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 18 miles.

"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we first need to calculate the total number of pie pieces Grandma Jones initially had. Since she baked 5 apple pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is:

5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces:

40 pieces - 14 pieces remaining = 26 pieces taken

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26.

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to calculate the total number of calories you can still consume without exceeding your daily calorie target.

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume are:

2000 calories (daily target) - 1800 calories (already consumed) = 200 calories

Next, we need to find out how many grams of chips correspond to 200 calories. We know that one serving of chips is 250 calories. The 300g bag has 5 servings, so each serving is:

300g / 5 servings = 60g per serving

Since 250 calories are in 60g of chips, we can calculate the number of grams that contain 200 calories:

(200 calories / 250 calories) * 60g = 48g

Therefore, you can eat 48 grams of chips without exceeding your daily calorie target.

"To determine Charlie's net profit from making and selling 20 candles, we need to calculate the total cost of the supplies and the total revenue from selling the candles, then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

1. **Calculate the total number of pounds of beeswax needed:**
   - Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, to make 20 candles, Charlie needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the beeswax and wicks:**
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00. Therefore, for 2 pounds, the cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times 10 \text{ dollars per pound} = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - If each candle is sold for $2.00, the total revenue from 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times 2 \text{ dollars per candle} = 40 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
     \[
     40 \text{ dollars} - 20 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:

"To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to determine the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply by the average time it takes to write one article.

1. **Monday:**
   - Number of articles: 5
   - Time spent: 5 articles * 4 hours/article = 20 hours

2. **Tuesday:**
   - Number of articles: 2/5 times more than Monday
   - Additional articles: 5 * (2/5) = 2
   - Total articles on Tuesday: 5 + 2 = 7
   - Time spent: 7 articles * 4 hours/article = 28 hours

3. **Wednesday:**
   - Number of articles: twice the number of articles on Tuesday
   - Total articles on Wednesday: 7 * 2 = 14
   - Time spent: 14 articles * 4 hours/article = 56 hours

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice used at work.
2. Calculate the total number of Post-it notes Candice had after purchasing the package.
3. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she originally had from the total to find out how many were in the package.

Candice placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee, so she used 220 Post-it notes at work.

She had 23 Post-it notes remaining overall after using 220, so the total number of Post-it notes she had before using them is:

220 (used) + 23 (remaining) = 243 (total before using)

Candice originally had 80 Post-it notes in her purse, so the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is:

243 (total before using) - 80 (originally had) = 163 (in the package)

The number of Post-it notes in the package is 163.

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he buys is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Therefore, the cost of each red tie is:

Cost per red tie = Cost per blue tie + (50% of Cost per blue tie)
Cost per red tie = $40 + (0.5 * $40)
Cost per red tie = $40 + $20
Cost per red tie = $60

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
Total spent on red ties = 10 * $60
Total spent on red ties = $600

Finally, we can calculate the total amount spent on all ties:

Total spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
Total spent on ties = $200 + $600
Total spent on ties = $800

"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.
2. Calculate the daily income from selling the eggs.
3. Calculate the weekly income by multiplying the daily income by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Step 1: Number of dozens of eggs produced per day
There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.
252 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 21 dozens

Step 2: Daily income from selling the eggs
Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, so we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen.
21 dozens * $2 per dozen = $42

Step 3: Weekly income
To find the weekly income, we multiply the daily income by 7.
$42 per day * 7 days = $294

Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week.

"To determine how long it takes Tom to get back, we first need to calculate the distance he travels from 1 to 4 PM.

Tom's ship travels at 10 miles per hour, and he sails from 1 to 4 PM, which is a total of 3 hours. The distance he travels is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to travel back the same distance at a rate of 6 miles per hour, we use the formula for time:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

"First, let's calculate the total weight of the 30 comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, the total weight of the comic books is:

30 comic books * 1/4 pound/comic book = 7.5 pounds

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, he still needs to remove:

15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds

Now, we need to find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove to get rid of the remaining 7.5 pounds. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys he needs to remove is:

7.5 pounds / (1/2 pound/toy) = 7.5 pounds * (2 toys/pound) = 15 toys

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

"To determine how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we first need to calculate the total revenue for each day.

**Thursday:**
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires at $60 each.
- The mechanic repairs 4 car tires at $40 each.

Revenue from truck tires on Thursday:
\[ 6 \text{ tires} \times \$60/\text{tire} = \$360 \]

Revenue from car tires on Thursday:
\[ 4 \text{ tires} \times \$40/\text{tire} = \$160 \]

Total revenue on Thursday:
\[ \$360 + \$160 = \$520 \]

**Friday:**
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 each.

Revenue from car tires on Friday:
\[ 12 \text{ tires} \times \$40/\text{tire} = \$480 \]

Total revenue on Friday:
\[ \$480 \]

Now, we compare the total revenue for both days to find the difference:

"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after accounting for the weight of the driver and the empty truck.
2. Divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of one box to find out how many boxes can be loaded.

First, let's find the remaining weight capacity of the bridge:

Remaining weight capacity = Bridge's weight limit - Weight of driver and empty truck
Remaining weight capacity = 5000 pounds - 3755 pounds
Remaining weight capacity = 1245 pounds

Now, we can determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded:

Maximum number of boxes = Remaining weight capacity / Weight of one box
Maximum number of boxes = 1245 pounds / 15 pounds per box
Maximum number of boxes = 83

Since we can't load a fraction of a box, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded is 83.

"To determine Marcy's annual pension if she quits after 30 years, we need to calculate the percentage of the full pension she is entitled to based on her years of service.

1. Marcy is entitled to 5% of the full pension for each year of service after 20 years.
2. She works for 30 years, which means she has 10 years of service beyond the 20-year mark.
3. For each of these 10 years, she earns an additional 5% of the full pension.
4. Therefore, she earns 10 * 5% = 50% of the full pension.

The full pension is $50,000/year. So, 50% of $50,000 is:

"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency and then use that to find out the total distance she can travel with a full tank.

1. First, we calculate the car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg). Since Sophia traveled 100 miles and needed 4 gallons to refill the tank, her car's fuel efficiency is:
   \[ \text{Fuel efficiency} = \frac{\text{Distance traveled}}{\text{Gallons used}} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ mpg} \]

2. Next, we use the car's fuel efficiency to determine the total distance she can travel on a full tank. The car's tank holds 12 gallons, so:
   \[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Fuel efficiency} \times \text{Tank capacity} = 25 \text{ mpg} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

"To find out how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week, the total number of students she teaches, and then multiply that by the amount she charges per student.

First, let's calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week:
- On weekdays (Monday to Friday), she teaches 5 classes each day. So for 5 days, that's 5 classes/day * 5 days = 25 classes.
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.

So, the total number of classes in a week is 25 (weekdays) + 8 (Saturday) = 33 classes.

Next, we calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week:
- Each class has 15 students, so for 33 classes, that's 33 classes * 15 students/class = 495 students.

Finally, we calculate the total amount of money she makes:
- She charges $15.00 per student, so for 495 students, that's 495 students * $15.00/student = $7,425.00.

Therefore, Judy makes $7,425.00 in one week.

"To determine how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to calculate the total cost of the cell phones including the interest, and then divide that total by the number of months in the installment plan.

1. Calculate the total cost of the cell phones without interest:
   \( 5 \text{ phones} \times \$150 \text{ per phone} = \$750 \)

2. Calculate the total interest for all the phones:
   \( 2\% \text{ interest} \times \$750 = 0.02 \times \$750 = \$15 \)

3. Add the interest to the total cost to get the total amount to be paid:
   \( \$750 + \$15 = \$765 \)

4. Divide the total amount by the number of months in the installment plan to find the monthly payment:
   \( \$765 \div 3 \text{ months} = \$255 \)

Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months.

"To solve this problem, we first need to round the prices of each type of flower to the nearest dollar and then calculate the total earnings based on the number of pots sold.

1. Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3.00 per pot.
2. Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2.00 per pot.
3. Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2.00 per pot.

Next, we calculate the total earnings for each type of flower:

1. Earnings from marigolds: 12 pots * $3.00 = $36.00
2. Earnings from petunias: 9 pots * $2.00 = $18.00
3. Earnings from begonias: 17 pots * $2.00 = $34.00

Finally, we add up the earnings from all the flowers to find the total:

Total earnings = $36.00 + $18.00 + $34.00 = $88.00

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level, starting from the top and working our way down.

Given that the top level (Level 4) has a square footage of 16, and each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of the other levels as follows:

- Level 4: 16 square feet
- Level 3: 16 * 2 = 32 square feet
- Level 2: 32 * 2 = 64 square feet
- Level 1: 64 * 2 = 128 square feet

Now, to find the average square footage, we sum the square footage of all levels and divide by the number of levels:

Average square footage = (128 + 64 + 32 + 16) / 4

Let's calculate the sum and then the average:

Sum = 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = 240

Average = 240 / 4 = 60

The average square footage of a level is 60.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, determine how much water each girl received. Since each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water:
   \[ \text{Water per girl} = \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

2. Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they received together is:
   \[ \text{Total water for girls} = 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

3. The boy received 6 liters of water.

4. Now, calculate the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy:
   \[ \text{Total water taken} = 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

5. Finally, subtract the total amount of water taken from the initial 24 liters to find out how much water is left:
   \[ \text{Water left} = 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( W \) represent the number of games won, and \( L \) represent the number of games lost. According to the problem, the team played 22 games in total, so we have:

\[ W + L = 22 \]

We are also told that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which gives us another equation:

\[ W = L + 8 \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 22 - 8 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know \( L \) (the number of games lost), we can find \( W \) (the number of games won) using the second equation:

\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"To find out how many quilt blocks Gene has in total, we need to calculate the number of vacations he has been on since he was 23 years old until he is 34 years old. 

First, we determine the number of years he has been going on vacations:
34 years old (current age) - 23 years old (age when he started vacationing) = 11 years of vacationing.

Since he goes on four vacations a year, we multiply the number of years by the number of vacations per year:
11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations.

Each vacation corresponds to one quilt block, so the total number of quilt blocks is 44.

"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the salary increases she will receive over these years, starting from the point where she has completed five years of service.

1. **Initial Monthly Salary**: $600
2. **Initial Annual Salary**: $600 * 12 = $7,200

Since Sylvie has just completed five years of service, she is eligible for her first 10% salary increase.

3. **First Salary Increase (after 5 years)**:
   - New Monthly Salary: $600 + ($600 * 10%) = $600 + $60 = $660
   - New Annual Salary: $660 * 12 = $7,920

After the first year of the increase (6 years of service), she will receive another 10% increase.

4. **Second Salary Increase (after 6 years)**:
   - New Monthly Salary: $660 + ($660 * 10%) = $660 + $66 = $726
   - New Annual Salary: $726 * 12 = $8,712

After the second year of the increase (7 years of service), she will receive another 10% increase.

5. **Third Salary Increase (after 7 years)**:
   - New Monthly Salary: $726 + ($726 * 10%) = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60
   - New Annual Salary: $798.60 * 12 = $9,583.20

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be $9,583.20.

"To determine how much Christina will spend on gift bags, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of guests who will actually attend the party.
2. Determine the number of gift bags needed based on the attendance.
3. Calculate the total cost of the gift bags.

Step 1: Calculate the number of guests who will actually attend the party.
Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, 3/4 of the invited guests will attend. Christina invited 16 friends, so the number of attendees will be:
\[ 16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12 \]

Step 2: Determine the number of gift bags needed.
Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per attending guest. Therefore, the number of gift bags needed is:
\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the gift bags.
Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost will be:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Therefore, Christina will spend $18 on gift bags.

"To determine how many pounds of potato salad Ted the T-Rex needs to bring to the picnic, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of potato salad the adult dinosaurs will eat.
2. Calculate the total amount of potato salad the child dinosaurs will eat.
3. Add the two amounts together to get the total amount of potato salad needed.

First, we calculate the amount of potato salad the adult dinosaurs will eat:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adult dinosaurs.
- Therefore, the total amount of potato salad for the adults is \( 10 \text{ lbs/adult} \times 20 \text{ adults} = 200 \text{ lbs} \).

Next, we calculate the amount of potato salad the child dinosaurs will eat:
- Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats \( 10 \text{ lbs} / 2 = 5 \text{ lbs} \).
- There are 5 child dinosaurs.
- Therefore, the total amount of potato salad for the children is \( 5 \text{ lbs/child} \times 5 \text{ children} = 25 \text{ lbs} \).

Finally, we add the two amounts together to get the total amount of potato salad needed:
- Total potato salad needed = \( 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs} \).

So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Gerald's original time:**
   - We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
   - Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald.
   - Therefore, Gerald's original time was 38 seconds + 2 seconds = 40 seconds.

2. **Calculate Gerald's improved time:**
   - Gerald improved his speed by 10%.
   - A 10% improvement in speed means he can run the same distance in 90% of his original time.
   - To find 90% of Gerald's original time, we calculate 0.90 * 40 seconds.

3. **Perform the calculation:**

James's sleep time = 2/3 * Harry's sleep time
James's sleep time = 2/3 * 9
James's sleep time = 6 hours

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract James's sleep time from Harry's sleep time:

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial volume of tomatoes before cooking.
2. Calculate how many cans of tomatoes were used.
3. Convert the number of cans into the number of tomatoes.

First, since the volume of the tomatoes is reduced by half when cooked into sauce, the initial volume of the tomatoes must have been twice the volume of the sauce. Freda made 32 ounces of sauce, so the initial volume of the tomatoes was:

\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes were used to get 64 ounces of tomatoes. We divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can:

\[ 64 \text{ ounces} \div 16 \text{ ounces/can} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Each can contains three tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is:

\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. We start with 30 cars on the motorway.
2. Some of these cars drive through in the first 15 minutes.
3. 20 more cars drive through in the next 15 minutes.
4. 5 cars take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the 20 cars that drove through in the next 15 minutes. This can be expressed as:
\[ x + 20 \]

The total number of cars that did not drive through the traffic jam is the 5 cars that took an exit. Therefore, the number of cars that did not drive through is 5.

The total number of cars that were originally on the motorway is the sum of the cars that drove through and the cars that did not drive through:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]

Subtract 25 from both sides to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the information given about the rate at which the fog bank moves. The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. We need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles.

First, we calculate the number of 3-mile segments in 42 miles:
42 miles / 3 miles per segment = 14 segments

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover one 3-mile segment, we can find the total time by multiplying the number of segments by the time it takes to cover one segment:
14 segments * 10 minutes per segment = 140 minutes

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box by subtracting the thickness of the walls from each dimension. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The inner dimensions will be:

- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:

Inner volume of one box = Length * Width * Height
Inner volume of one box = 3 inches * 4 inches * 2 inches
Inner volume of one box = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume:

Total inner volume = Inner volume of one box * Number of boxes
Total inner volume = 24 cubic inches * 3
Total inner volume = 72 cubic inches

2. The 115 cookies are 15 more than he intended to bake, so he intended to bake 115 - 15 = 100 cookies.
3. He intended to bake twice as many as he did last year, so last year he baked 100 / 2 = 50 cookies.

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate on average, we first need to calculate the total area of the fruit roll-ups each of them ate. The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its width by its length.

For Beatrice:
- Width = 2 roll-ups
- Length = 24 roll-ups
- Area (total eaten) = 2 * 24 = 48 roll-ups

For Marcell:
- Width = 3 roll-ups
- Length = 14 roll-ups
- Area (total eaten) = 3 * 14 = 42 roll-ups

Now, to find the average, we add the total amount eaten by both and divide by 2 (since there are two people).

Total eaten by both = 48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups
Average eaten = 90 / 2 = 45 roll-ups

"To determine how much water Julia's boat took on by the time she reached shore, we need to calculate the total distance she rowed and then use that to find out how much water entered the boat.

First, we know that it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet. The shore was 64 seconds away, so we can calculate the total distance she rowed by setting up a proportion:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{x \text{ feet}}{64 \text{ seconds}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{20 \text{ feet} \times 64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}} \]
\[ x = \frac{1280 \text{ feet} \cdot \text{seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}} \]
\[ x = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. To find out how much water the boat took on over 80 feet, we set up another proportion:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = \frac{y \text{ liters}}{80 \text{ feet}} \]

Solving for \( y \):

\[ y = \frac{2 \text{ liters} \times 80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} \]
\[ y = \frac{160 \text{ liters} \cdot \text{feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} \]
\[ y = 16 \text{ liters} \]

So, by the time Julia reached shore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water.

"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue she will make from selling it at the new, increased price. Then, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - She bought 10 boards at $10 each.
   - Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

2. **Calculate the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - She bought 5 boards at $16 each.
   - Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

3. **Calculate the total cost of all the lumber:**
   - Total cost = $100 (2 x 4 x 10 boards) + $80 (4 x 4 x 10 boards) = $180.

4. **Determine the new selling price for each type of board:**
   - The price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards increased by 50%, so the new price is $10 * 1.5 = $15 per board.
   - The price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards also increased by 50%, so the new price is $16 * 1.5 = $24 per board.

5. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $15/board = $150.

6. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $24/board = $120.

7. **Calculate the total revenue from selling all the lumber:**
   - Total revenue = $150 (2 x 4 x 10 boards) + $120 (4 x 4 x 10 boards) = $270.

8. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $270 - $180 = $90.

Sasha makes a profit of $90.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many teaspoons of sugar Katy used, given the total amount of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water and the ratio of sugar to water.

The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total parts in the ratio are 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined. We can set up the following proportion to find out how many of these 120 parts are teaspoons of sugar:

\[
\frac{7}{20} = \frac{x}{120}
\]

Where \( x \) is the number of teaspoons of sugar. To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[
x = \frac{7}{20} \times 120
\]

\[
x = 7 \times 6
\]

\[
x = 42
\]

So, Katy used 42 teaspoons of sugar.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. On the first day, there were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles. So, the total number of vehicles on the first day is:
   \( 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \)

2. On the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. This total includes the vehicles from the first day and the vehicles from the second day. So, the number of vehicles added on the second day is:
   \( 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \)

3. Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:
   \( 20 \text{ vehicles} \div 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 4 \text{ containers} \)

Therefore, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.
   - Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago.
   - Therefore, \( 40,000 = L + 0.30L \)
   - \( 40,000 = 1.30L \)
   - \( L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} \)
   - \( L = 30,769.23 \) (approximately)

2. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later:**
   - Adrien's salary increased by 40% from four years ago.
   - New salary for Adrien = \( 40,000 + 0.40 \times 40,000 \)
   - New salary for Adrien = \( 40,000 + 16,000 \)
   - New salary for Adrien = \( 56,000 \)

3. **Calculate Lylah's salary four years later:**
   - Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's.
   - Percentage increase for Adrien = 40%
   - New salary for Lylah = \( 30,769.23 + 0.40 \times 30,769.23 \)
   - New salary for Lylah = \( 30,769.23 + 12,307.69 \)
   - New salary for Lylah = \( 43,076.92 \) (approximately)

4. **Calculate the total salary for both four years later:**
   - Total salary = Adrien's new salary + Lylah's new salary
   - Total salary = \( 56,000 + 43,076.92 \)
   - Total salary = \( 99,076.92 \)

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is approximately $99,076.92.

"To calculate the total cost, we need to first determine which items are nonfood and then apply the 10% tax to those items. Milk and eggs are food items, so they are not taxed. The nonfood items are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps.

The cost of the food items is:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
Total cost of food items: $2 + $3 = $5

The cost of the nonfood items before tax is:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4
Total cost of nonfood items: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

The tax on the nonfood items is 10% of $10, which is:
$10 * 0.10 = $1

The total cost of the nonfood items after tax is:
$10 + $1 = $11

The total cost of all items is the sum of the cost of food items and the cost of nonfood items after tax:
$5 + $11 = $16

"To calculate Kim's weekly profit, we need to determine his total expenses and subtract them from his total income.

First, let's calculate the total number of clients:
- Current clients: 3
- Potential clients: 5
- Total clients: 3 + 5 = 8

Next, we calculate the total expenses for the cleaning supplies:
- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
- Cost of bleach per bottle: $2
- Cost of a pack of cloths: $5

Total cost of bleach for all clients:
- 2 bottles/client * 8 clients * $2/bottle = 16 * $2 = $32

Total cost of cloths for all clients:
- 1 pack/client * 8 clients * $5/pack = 8 * $5 = $40

Total expenses:
- Total cost of bleach + Total cost of cloths = $32 + $40 = $72

Now, we calculate the profit:
- Total income: $92
- Total expenses: $72
- Profit: $92 - $72 = $20

Therefore, Kim will make a profit of $20 each week.

"To find out how many blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the total number of pieces from all the Lego sets he dumped on the floor.

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, which means it has \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first set, which means it has \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

Now, we add up all the pieces from the three sets:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

So, Johnny picks up 2125 blocks.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and calculate the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the 30 bees return, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.
3. In the following 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 bees leave the hive, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.
4. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before and hadn't already returned comes back to the hive. This means the bees that left in the first 6 hours (30 bees) and the bees that left in the third 6-hour period (60 bees) minus the bees that returned in the second 6-hour period (15 bees) will return.

So, the total number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is:
\[ 30 + 60 - 15 = 75 \]

Therefore, Debra saw 75 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then add the change she received to this amount.

The cost of 1 adult ticket is $12.
The cost of 1 child ticket is $10.

The total cost for 1 adult and 1 child ticket is:
$12 (adult ticket) + $10 (child ticket) = $22

Brittany's mom received $8 in change, which means the amount she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets plus the change she received:
$22 (total cost of tickets) + $8 (change) = $30

Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30.

"To determine how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home and then find the difference between these times.

First, we need to convert the distances from miles to feet because the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance to home in feet:
3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet

Tim's distance to home in feet:
2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to get home.

Steve's time to get home:
15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes

Tim's time to get home:
10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

The difference in time between the two is:
40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

The winner will be waiting for 4 minutes before the loser finishes the race.

"To calculate how much Shawnda made, we need to determine the total number of tires she inflated and then multiply that by the cost per tire.

- Bicycles have 2 tires each. If 5 people came by with bicycles, that's 5 bicycles * 2 tires/bicycle = 10 tires.
- Tricycles have 3 tires each. If 3 people came by with tricycles, that's 3 tricycles * 3 tires/tricycle = 9 tires.
- A unicycle has 1 tire. If 1 person came by with a unicycle, that's 1 unicycle * 1 tire/unicycle = 1 tire.

Now, we add up all the tires: 10 tires (bicycles) + 9 tires (tricycles) + 1 tire (unicycle) = 20 tires.

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, so the total amount made is 20 tires * 25 cents/tire = 500 cents.

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert 500 cents to dollars: 500 cents / 100 cents/dollar = 5 dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final number of fries left to find the original number of fries in the pack.

1. We start with the 5 fries left after the ants took one. Before the ants took the fry, there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries.
2. The raccoon took two thirds of the fries before the ants, which means the 6 fries left were one third of the fries before the raccoon took them. So, before the raccoon, there were 6 * 3 = 18 fries.
3. The three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so before the pigeons, there were 18 + (3 * 3) = 18 + 9 = 27 fries.
4. The seagull ate half the amount that Dave ate, which was 14 / 2 = 7 fries. So, before the seagull, there were 27 + 7 = 34 fries.
5. Dave ate 14 fries, so before he ate any, there were 34 + 14 = 48 fries.

Therefore, the original number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was 48.

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we can break down the calculation as follows:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends in class on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
   - He has 3 classes each day, and each class is 1 hour long.
   - Therefore, he spends 3 hours each of these days.
   - There are 3 such days in a week.
   - So, in one week, he spends \(3 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week}\).

2. Calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends in class on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
   - He has 2 classes each day, and each class is 2 hours long.
   - Therefore, he spends 4 hours each of these days.
   - There are 2 such days in a week.
   - So, in one week, he spends \(4 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days/week} = 8 \text{ hours/week}\).

3. Add the hours from both parts of the week to get the total number of hours per week:
   - Total hours per week = \(9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week}\).

4. Multiply the total number of hours per week by the number of weeks in the semester to get the total number of hours in the semester:
   - Total hours in the semester = \(17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}\).

Therefore, Kimo spends 272 hours attending classes in one semester.

"To determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser, we first need to calculate the total distance each person runs.

**Blake's Distance:**
Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Each back and forth is 200 yards (100 yards there and 100 yards back).

\[ \text{Blake's total distance} = 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

**Kelly's Distance:**
Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field, and then she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. The distance to the 40-yard line and back is 80 yards (40 yards there and 40 yards back).

\[ \text{Kelly's total distance} = 1 \times 200 + 34 \times 80 \]
\[ \text{Kelly's total distance} = 200 + 2720 = 2920 \text{ yards} \]

**Difference in Distance:**
To find out how much farther the winner runs than the loser, we subtract the smaller distance from the larger distance.

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the original price of the bag of marbles: $20.
2. Determine the number of 2-month periods in 36 months: \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) periods.
3. Calculate the price increase for each period. A 20% increase means the price is multiplied by 1.20 (100% + 20% = 120% = 1.20) for each period.
4. Apply the increase over the 18 periods: \( 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \).

Now, let's calculate the final price:

\[ 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Using a calculator to find \( (1.20)^{18} \):

\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 38.3376 \]

Now, multiply this by the original price:

"Let's denote Seth's current age as \( S \) and Brooke's current age as \( B \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

We can simplify the second equation:
\[ S + 2 + B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):

"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the total time for peeling and cutting all 60 potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel all the potatoes:
- It takes 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total peeling time is \( 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut all the potatoes:
- It takes 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- For 60 potatoes, the total cutting time is \( 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 300 \text{ seconds} \).

Convert the cutting time from seconds to minutes:
- \( 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 5 \text{ minutes} \).

Now, add the peeling and cutting times together:
- Total time = 90 minutes (peeling) + 5 minutes (cutting) = 95 minutes.

"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to first calculate their total revenue and then their total costs, including the cost of lemons.

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They made a profit of $25.
   - Let's denote the total revenue as \( R \) and the total cost as \( C \).
   - The profit formula is: \( \text{Profit} = R - C \).
   - Given that the profit is $25, we have: \( 25 = R - C \).

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The cost to make one gallon of lemonade is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, totaling $5 per gallon.
   - Let \( G \) be the number of gallons they made.
   - The total cost \( C \) is then \( 5G \).

3. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon.
   - The revenue from one gallon is \( 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \) dollars.
   - The total revenue \( R \) from \( G \) gallons is \( 10G \).

4. **Set up the profit equation:**
   - Substitute \( R \) and \( C \) into the profit equation: \( 25 = 10G - 5G \).
   - Simplify the equation: \( 25 = 5G \).
   - Solve for \( G \): \( G = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) gallons.

5. **Calculate the cost of lemons:**
   - The cost of lemons per gallon is $3.
   - For 5 gallons, the total cost of lemons is \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) dollars.

Therefore, the amount spent on lemons is $15.

   \[ \text{Remaining} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \]

4. **Donation to Charity**: Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[ \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \]

5. **Remaining Amount After Donation**:
   \[ \text{Remaining After Donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \]

6. **Expenses for Daughter and Wife**:
   \[ \text{Total Given to Daughter and Wife} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

7. **Final Amount Left**:
   \[ \text{Final Amount} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \]

Therefore, after all these expenses and donations, Zaid will still have 350$.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Bo has 40 crabs.
2. Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has \(40 - 4 = 36\) crabs.
3. Rani has ten more crabs than Monic, so Rani has \(36 + 10 = 46\) crabs.

Now, to find the total number of crabs the three have together, we add the number of crabs each person has:

\[40 + 36 + 46 = 122\]

"To find out how much Lloyd earned for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, he tutored for 5 hours at a rate of $10 per hour:
5 hours * $10/hour = $50

For the second week, he tutored for 8 hours at the same rate:
8 hours * $10/hour = $80

Now, we add the earnings from both weeks to find the total:
$50 + $80 = $130

Lloyd earned $130 for the first two weeks.

"To find the number of votes the loser got, we first need to determine the number of votes the winner received. The winner got 3/4 of the total votes. Since the total number of students who voted is 80, we calculate the winner's votes as follows:

Winner's votes = (3/4) * 80

Now, to find the number of votes the loser got, we subtract the winner's votes from the total number of votes:

Loser's votes = Total votes - Winner's votes

Let's do the calculations:

Winner's votes = (3/4) * 80 = 60

Loser's votes = 80 - 60 = 20

The number of votes the loser got is 20.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identate the ages:**
   - Let \( J \) be Jean's current age.
   - Let \( M \) be Mark's current age.
   - Jan's current age is given as 30.

2. **Express the relationships:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark: \( J = M + 2 \).
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.

3. **Determine Jan's age two years ago:**
   - Jan's age two years ago was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).

4. **Express the relationship two years ago:**
   - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
   - According to the problem, \( M - 2 = 5 + \frac{28}{2} \).

5. **Solve for Mark's age:**
   - \( M - 2 = 5 + 14 \)
   - \( M - 2 = 19 \)
   - \( M = 21 \)

6. **Determine Jean's age:**
   - Since \( J = M + 2 \), we have \( J = 21 + 2 \).
   - \( J = 23 \)

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old.

"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time each team takes to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay.

**Team A (Well-Rounded Team):**
Each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time for Team A = 4 * 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

**Team B (Less Well-Rounded Team):**
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Total time for Team B = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

**Difference in Time:**
The difference in time between the two teams is:
222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

1. The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die:
   - The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - The probability is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \) or 50%.

2. The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on one roll is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \).
   - Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \) or 25%.

Now, we need to find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row. This can be calculated as the difference in probabilities, expressed as a percentage of the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[ 50\% - 25\% = 25\% \]

To express this difference as a percentage of the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:
\[ \frac{25\%}{25\%} \times 100\% = 100\% \]

So, it is 100% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"To find out how many rats are in each cage, let's break down the information given:

1. The total number of pieces of straw distributed is 160.
2. The rats are kept in 3 cages, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
3. There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
4. There is a pen of rabbits, and 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters and the rabbits:

- Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw, and there are 10 cages of hamsters, so the total number of pieces of straw for the hamsters is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) pieces.
- The rabbits get 20 pieces of straw.

So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters and the rabbits is \(50 + 20 = 70\) pieces.

Now, subtract this from the total number of pieces of straw distributed to find out how many pieces are given to the rats:

- Total pieces of straw for the rats = \(160 - 70 = 90\) pieces.

Since each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, we can find the total number of rats by dividing the total pieces of straw for the rats by the number of pieces each rat gets:

- Total number of rats = \(90 \div 6 = 15\) rats.

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, the number of rats in each cage is:

- Number of rats in each cage = \(15 \div 3 = 5\).

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is:

\[ A = P(1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of months the money is invested or borrowed for.

Given:
- \( P = 100 \) dollars
- \( r = 2\% = 0.02 \)
- \( n = 3 \) months

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ A = 100(1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100(1.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 \]
\[ A = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, Mandy should give Benedict $106.12.

"To determine the number of bags the trader sold, we can set up an equation based on the information provided.

Let \( x \) be the number of bags the trader bought and sold.

The cost of buying the bags is \( 20x \) dollars.
The cost of transporting the bags is \( 2x \) dollars.
The total cost for the trader is \( 20x + 2x = 22x \) dollars.

The selling price of the bags is \( 30x \) dollars.

The profit is the selling price minus the total cost:
\[ \text{Profit} = 30x - 22x = 8x \]

We know the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 8x = 400 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

The trader sold 50 bags.

"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide that total by the number of friends.

1. **Cost of tickets**: They spent $20.25 on 3 tickets.
2. **Cost of food**: They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets, so the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.
3. **Cost of rides**: They went on 2 different rides, each costing $33, so the total cost for the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost of tickets: $20.25
- Total cost of food: $15.75
- Total cost of rides: $66

Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102

Since there are 3 friends, we divide the total cost by 3 to find out how much each friend paid:
$102 / 3 = $34

Each friend paid $34.

"To find out how many pounds of insects ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per week for ten ducks.
2. Divide the weekly total by 7 to find the daily requirement.

Step 1: Total weekly requirement for ten ducks
Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, so for ten ducks:
3.5 pounds/duck/week * 10 ducks = 35 pounds/week

Step 2: Convert the weekly requirement to a daily requirement
35 pounds/week ÷ 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

So, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day.

"To determine how many trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the net number of trees Tom plants each year.
2. Determine the total number of trees after 10 years.
3. Calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years.
4. Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees to find the final number of trees.

Step 1: Net number of trees planted each year
Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year, so the net number of trees he adds each year is:
10 - 2 = 8 trees

Step 2: Total number of trees after 10 years
Starting with 50 trees, after 10 years, the total number of trees will be:
50 + (8 * 10) = 50 + 80 = 130 trees

Step 3: Number of trees that die after 10 years
30% of the trees die, so the number of trees that die is:
30% of 130 = 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees

Step 4: Final number of trees
Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees:
130 - 39 = 91 trees

The final number of trees Tom has left is:

1. **Friday Morning:**
   - Sue starts with 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Saturday Morning:**
   - The neighbors take back one third of the pink flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - So, 6 pink flamingos are taken back and painted white.
   - The remaining pink flamingos are \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - The 6 white flamingos are then placed back on the yard.
   - At the end of Saturday, Sue has 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

3. **Sunday Morning:**

"To find out how much 8 pens will cost, we first need to determine the cost of one pen. According to the information provided, a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined.

The cost of a pencil is $1.20 and the cost of an eraser is $0.30. Therefore, the cost of one pen is:

Cost of one pen = Cost of one pencil + Cost of one eraser
Cost of one pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of one pen = $1.50

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

Cost of 8 pens = 8 * Cost of one pen
Cost of 8 pens = 8 * $1.50
Cost of 8 pens = $12.00

"To determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the 40 restaurants. Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots.

Total carrots distributed = Number of restaurants × Carrots per restaurant
Total carrots distributed = 40 × 2
Total carrots distributed = 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the total amount of carrots distributed from the total amount of carrots available to find out how many pounds will not be used.

Pounds of carrots not used = Total pounds of carrots - Total carrots distributed
Pounds of carrots not used = 200 - 80
Pounds of carrots not used = 120

"To find out how many Pokemon cards Elaine has now in total, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. After a month, she collected three times the initial number, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is 60 + 40 = 100 cards. So, in the third month, she collected 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, to find the total number of cards Elaine has, we add the initial number of cards to the cards collected in each of the three months:

Initial cards: 20
First month: 60
Second month: 40
Third month: 200

Total cards = 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320

"To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we first need to calculate the number of sentences he edits for each publisher and then calculate the earnings from each publisher.

Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B each week.

Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, Mark earns:
500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays 10 cents per sentence. For 500 sentences, Mark earns:
500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

Adding the earnings from both publishers, we get:
2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

Therefore, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week.

"To determine the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the lowest score among the first five tests.
2. Calculate the total points needed for an average of 93 over the five highest scores.
3. Determine the score required on the sixth test to reach this total.

First, let's identify the lowest score among the first five tests:
- Scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86
- The lowest score is 71.

Next, we calculate the total points needed for an average of 93 over the five highest scores:
- The formula for the average is: (Sum of the scores) / (Number of scores)
- We want the average to be 93 over 5 tests, so the total points needed is: 93 * 5 = 465

Now, we need to find out the sum of the four highest scores from the first five tests:
- Scores (excluding the lowest score of 71): 89, 92, 100, 86
- Sum of these scores: 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367

Let \( x \) be the score Brinley needs on the sixth test. The total sum of the five highest scores (including the sixth test score) should be 465:
- 367 + \( x \) = 465
- \( x \) = 465 - 367
- \( x \) = 98

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 98 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score.

"To find out how many kilometers Michael rode in total, we can break down the problem into two parts: the distance he rode in the first four weeks and the distance he rode in the following three weeks.

1. For the first four weeks:
- He rides 5 times a week.
- Each ride is 25 kilometers.
- So, each week he rides 5 * 25 = 125 kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rides 4 * 125 = 500 kilometers.

2. For the next three weeks:
- He rides 2 times a week.
- Each ride is 60 kilometers.
- So, each week he rides 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rides 3 * 120 = 360 kilometers.

Adding the distances from both periods gives us the total distance:
500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40g. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars * 40g/chocolate bar = 1000g

Next, we are told that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. Therefore, the weight of each candied apple is:
40g / 2 = 20g

With 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 candied apples * 20g/candied apple = 1600g

Now, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag:
1000g (chocolate bars) + 1600g (candied apples) = 2600g

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600 grams.

"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:
2 pairs * $20/pair = $40

The total cost for the jacket and shoes is:
$30 (jacket) + $40 (shoes) = $70

Sara already has $10 saved, so the remaining amount she needs to save is:
$70 (total cost) - $10 (already saved) = $60

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so her earnings from babysitting are:
4 times * $5/time = $20

Adding her babysitting earnings to her savings, she now has:
$10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting earnings) = $30

The remaining amount she needs to save is:
$70 (total cost) - $30 (current savings) = $40

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to save the remaining $40, we divide the remaining amount by her earnings per lawn mowed:
$40 / $4/lawn = 10

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day.
2. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
3. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

We can set up the following equation based on the total number of eggs collected each day:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a certain distance \( d \) at a constant speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substitute the perimeter for \( d \) and Gary's walking speed for \( v \):

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park.

"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the first day: 100 customers.
2. Calculate the number of customers on the second day: 100 customers (first day) + 50 more customers = 150 customers.
3. Calculate the total number of customers over the three days: 500 customers.
4. Subtract the number of customers from the first two days from the total to find the number of customers on the third day: 500 customers (total) - 100 customers (first day) - 150 customers (second day).

Now, let's do the math:

500 - 100 - 150 = 250

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( B \) be the amount of water in the big pool now, and \( S \) be the amount of water in the small pool now. Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool was \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons, and the amount of water in the small pool was \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

First, substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase. The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00, given that she earns $8.00 per hour. We do this by dividing the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ 352.00 \div 8.00 = 44 \]

So, Lori will need to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we first need to determine the number of dahlias. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, and there are 4 roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, to find the total number of flowers, we add the number of roses to the number of dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's current age is given as 21 years.
2. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age. Therefore, Adrian's current age is:
   \[
   3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack. Therefore, Zack's current age is:
   \[
   2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
   \]

Next, we need to calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years will be:
  \[
  21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years}
  \]
- Adrian's age in three years will be:
  \[
  63 + 3 = 66 \text{ years}
  \]
- Zack's age in three years will be:
  \[
  42 + 3 = 45 \text{ years}
  \]

Now, we calculate the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \text{ years}
\]

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna, and then subtract the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the overall total of 251 points.

1. Naomi's score is given as 68 points.
2. Yuri's score is 10 more than half of Naomi's score. Half of Naomi's score is \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \), so Yuri's score is \( 34 + 10 = 44 \) points.
3. Brianna's score is 17 points more than Naomi's score, so Brianna's score is \( 68 + 17 = 85 \) points.

Now, we add up the scores of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[ 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \]

Finally, we subtract this sum from the total points to find Jojo's score:
\[ 251 - 197 = 54 \]

Jojo scored 54 points.

"To find out how much time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on each type of puzzle and then add them together.

For the crossword puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- So, the time spent on crossword puzzles is 10 minutes/puzzle * 3 puzzles = 30 minutes.

For the sudoku puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.
- So, the time spent on sudoku puzzles is 5 minutes/puzzle * 8 puzzles = 40 minutes.

Now, we add the time spent on both types of puzzles:
- Total time spent = time spent on crossword puzzles + time spent on sudoku puzzles
- Total time spent = 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes.

Therefore, Carmen spent 70 minutes playing these games over the weekend.

- Water type: 40

Total initial cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

Next, we account for the changes:
- He loses 8 water type cards: 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards
- He buys 14 grass type cards: 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards

Now, let's calculate the new total number of cards:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 34
- Water type: 32

New total cards = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the initial pens Ram buys and the additional pens he can create by mixing the ink from the empty ones.

1. Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. After using these 25 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen. So, from the 25 empty pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.
3. After using these 5 new pens, he will have 5 more empty pens, which he can again mix to make 1 more pen.
4. After using this 1 pen, he will have 1 more empty pen, but he won't have enough to make another pen since he needs 5 empty pens to make one new pen.

So, the total number of pens Ram gets to use is the initial 25 pens plus the 5 new pens plus the 1 additional pen he made.

"To determine how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we first need to calculate the number of cookies each of them ate on both days and then convert those numbers into calories.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of cookies Sue ate on Monday.**
Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday. Her sister ate 5 cookies.
Sue's cookies on Monday = 4 * 5 = 20 cookies

**Step 2: Calculate the number of cookies Sue ate on Tuesday.**
Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday. Her sister ate 13 cookies.
Sue's cookies on Tuesday = 2 * 13 = 26 cookies

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of cookies each ate over the two days.**
Sue's total cookies = 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies
Her sister's total cookies = 5 (Monday) + 13 (Tuesday) = 18 cookies

**Step 4: Convert the number of cookies into calories.**
1 cookie = 200 calories
Sue's total calories = 46 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 9200 calories
Her sister's total calories = 18 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 3600 calories

**Step 5: Calculate the difference in calories consumed.**
Difference in calories = Sue's total calories - Her sister's total calories
Difference in calories = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

"To find out how many boys are in the third class, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students in the school.
2. Determine the total number of girls in the school.
3. Use the information about the number of girls in the first and second classes to find the number of girls in the third class.
4. Subtract the number of girls in the third class from the total number of students in the third class to find the number of boys.

Step 1: Total number of students in the school
There are 3 classes, each with 20 students.
Total students = 3 classes * 20 students/class = 60 students

Step 2: Total number of girls in the school
The school is 50% girls, so half of the students are girls.
Total girls = 50% of 60 students = 0.5 * 60 = 30 girls

Step 3: Number of girls in the third class
The first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls.
Total girls in the first and second classes = 15 girls + 12 girls = 27 girls
Number of girls in the third class = Total girls - Girls in the first and second classes
Number of girls in the third class = 30 girls - 27 girls = 3 girls

Step 4: Number of boys in the third class
Each class has 20 students, so the third class has 20 students.
Number of boys in the third class = Total students in the third class - Number of girls in the third class
Number of boys in the third class = 20 students - 3 girls = 17 boys

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Last night, Rick killed:
   - 10 wolves
   - 15 cougars

2. Today, Rick killed:
   - Three times as many wolves as cougars.
   - Three fewer cougars than the previous night, which means he killed \(15 - 3 = 12\) cougars today.

3. Since today Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars, and he killed 12 cougars, the number of wolves he killed today is \(3 \times 12 = 36\).

4. Now, let's add up all the animals Rick killed:
   - Last night: \(10 + 15 = 25\) animals
   - Today: \(36 + 12 = 48\) animals

5. The total number of animals Rick killed is \(25 + 48 = 73\).

"To find out how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to first determine how many times Anne went down the slide. 

Mitchel went down the slide 30 times. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find 30% of Mitchel's 30 slides, we calculate:

30% of 30 = 0.30 * 30 = 9

So, Anne went down the slide 9 times less than Mitchel. Therefore, the number of times Anne went down the slide is:

30 - 9 = 21

Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4:

21 * 4 = 84

Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

"First, let's determine the total number of cows before Mr. Sylas buys the additional 40 cows. There are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so the total number of cows initially is:

10 stalls * 20 cows/stall = 200 cows

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. This means each stall gets:

40 cows / 20 stalls = 2 cows/stall

Now, each stall will have the original 20 cows plus the 2 new cows:

20 cows/stall + 2 cows/stall = 22 cows/stall

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:

22 cows/stall * 8 stalls = 176 cows

So, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is 176.

"To find out how much money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the total value of each type of coin and dollar bill and then sum them up.

1. The value of the pennies: 100 pennies * $0.01/penny = $1.00
2. The value of the nickels: 40 nickels * $0.05/nickel = $2.00
3. The value of the dimes: 20 dimes * $0.10/dime = $2.00
4. The value of the dollar bills: 40 dollar bills * $1.00/dollar bill = $40.00

Now, we add up all the values:
$1.00 (pennies) + $2.00 (nickels) + $2.00 (dimes) + $40.00 (dollar bills) = $45.00

Therefore, Brady has $45.00 in his piggy bank.

"To determine the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
3. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the original total weight to find the current weight of the tree.

First, we calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it. The tree is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. Therefore, the number of 10-foot sections in the tree is:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

The total weight of the tree is:

\[ 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the weight of the wood that the termites ate. Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, the weight of the wood they ate is:

\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.30 = 2400 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the original total weight to find the current weight of the tree:

\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

The current weight of the redwood tree is 5600 pounds.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of apples Jamal has:**
   - Andrea has 52 apples.
   - Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
   - Therefore, Jamal has \(52 - 8 = 44\) apples.

2. **Determine the number of bananas Jamal has:**
   - Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.
   - Therefore, Jamal has \(44 + 4 = 48\) bananas.

3. **Determine the number of bananas Andrea has:**
   - Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.
   - Therefore, Andrea has \(\frac{48}{2} = 24\) bananas.

4. **Calculate the total number of fruits:**
   - Andrea's fruits: 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits.
   - Jamal's fruits: 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92 fruits.

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we first calculate the amount needed for each day and then sum these amounts.

1. Calculate the flour needed for 36 cookies:
   - Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies, we can find the amount needed for 36 cookies by setting up a proportion:
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{36 \text{ cookies}}
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 36 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = 6 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. Calculate the flour needed for 30 cookies:
   - Similarly, for 30 cookies:
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{y \text{ cups}}{30 \text{ cookies}}
   \]
   Solving for \( y \):
   \[
   y = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 30 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = 5 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. Add the amounts of flour needed for both days:
   \[
   6 \text{ cups} + 5 \text{ cups} = 11 \text{ cups}
   \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

12 team members * 2 guests/team member = 24 guests

Adding the team members, the guests, and the coaches, the total number of people is:
12 team members + 24 guests + 3 coaches = 39 people

Each pizza serves 3 people, so the number of pizzas needed is:
39 people / 3 people/pizza = 13 pizzas

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost is:
13 pizzas * $15/pizza = $195

Therefore, Maddy will spend $195 on pizza.

"To determine how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we first need to calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones and then find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads.

1. Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
2. The total length of the topaz gemstones is \( 8 \times 1 = 8 \) inches.
3. The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, so the remaining length for the sterling silver beads is \( 25 - 8 = 17 \) inches.
4. Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, so the number of sterling silver beads needed to fill 17 inches is \( 17 \div 0.25 = 68 \).

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. In the second week, they each doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week.

So, in the second week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stories they wrote over the two weeks:
- Alani wrote \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Adding these together gives the total number of stories:
\(60 + 120 + 180 = 360\)

"To find out how many rows of 5 stars there are on the flag, we can start by calculating the total number of stars in the rows that are not 5-star rows.

There are three rows of 8 stars each, so:
3 rows * 8 stars/row = 24 stars

There are two rows of 6 stars each, so:
2 rows * 6 stars/row = 12 stars

Now, we can add the stars from the 8-star rows and the 6-star rows to find the total number of stars that are not in the 5-star rows:
24 stars + 12 stars = 36 stars

The flag has 76 stars in total, so the number of stars in the 5-star rows is:
76 stars - 36 stars = 40 stars

Since each of the 5-star rows contains 5 stars, the number of 5-star rows is:
40 stars / 5 stars/row = 8 rows

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane and then use that speed to calculate the time it took to cover 480 miles.

1. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour.
2. The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles/hour.
3. To find the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover 480 miles, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of medals Izzy has:**
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali.
   - Therefore, Izzy has \( 22 - 5 = 17 \) medals.

2. **Calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:**
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 17 medals.
   - Together, they have \( 22 + 17 = 39 \) medals.

3. **Determine the total number of medals given out for counting:**
   - According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out.
   - Let \( T \) be the total number of medals given out.
   - Therefore, \( 39 = \frac{T}{10} \).

4. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - Multiply both sides of the equation by 10 to isolate \( T \):
   - \( T = 39 \times 10 = 390 \).

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390.

"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars. There are 8 packets, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, so:

\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars/packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we need to determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get in total. There are 4 adults, and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars/adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, and these 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them, so each child will get:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars/child} \]

Each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

"To determine how much money Susan earns, we first need to calculate the total time she spends working, excluding her half-hour pause.

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this is equivalent to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

She takes a half-hour pause, which is 30 minutes. Therefore, the total time she spends working is 180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes.

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide 150 by 10, which gives us 150 / 10 = 15 intervals.

Since she earns $5 for each interval, her total earnings are 15 intervals * $5/interval = $75.

   - Mike has 21 points.
   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
   - Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

2. **Points After the Fourth Round:**
   - Mike has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point. Mike's new total is \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
   - Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point. Jim's total remains 18 points.
   - Tony has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point. Tony's new total is \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

3. **Total Points After the Fourth Round:**
   - Mike: 22 points
   - Jim: 18 points
   - Tony: 43 points

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much weight Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can calculate the weekly weight loss for Joey as follows:

8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Now, we know that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will also lose 2 pounds, but it will take her 4 weeks to do so.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we can set up the following proportion:

If 2 pounds are lost in 4 weeks, then 8 pounds will be lost in \( x \) weeks.

We can solve for \( x \) by setting up the equation:

2 pounds / 4 weeks = 8 pounds / \( x \) weeks

Cross-multiplying gives us:

2 * \( x \) = 8 * 4

\( x \) = (8 * 4) / 2

\( x \) = 32 / 2

\( x \) = 16

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \). According to the problem, the number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the offense has \( 2D \) players. The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the special teams have \( \frac{D}{2} \) players.

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:

\[ 2 \cdot 3D + 2 \cdot \frac{D}{2} = 2 \cdot 105 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 6D + D = 210 \]

\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7:

\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]

\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

"To find out how many people show up for Martha's party, let's break down the information step by step:

1. Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each, which totals:
   2 families * 6 people/family = 12 people

2. She also invited 3 families with 4 people each, which totals:
   3 families * 4 people/family = 12 people

3. Adding these together, the total number of people invited is:

"To find the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has after buying from Johanna and receiving more from his father.
2. Multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble to find the total weight.

First, let's calculate the total number of marbles:

- Solomon initially had 50 marbles.
- He bought 20 more marbles from Johanna, so he now has 50 + 20 = 70 marbles.
- His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since he bought 20 marbles, his father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \) marbles.
- Adding the marbles from his father, Solomon now has 70 + 8 = 78 marbles.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the marbles:

- Each marble weighs 2 kg.
- The total weight is therefore 78 marbles * 2 kg/marble = 156 kg.

The total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is 156 kg.

1. **Number of Boys**: The problem states there are 30 boys in the classroom.

2. **Number of Girls**: The problem states there are 3 times as many girls as boys. Therefore, the number of girls is:
   \[
   3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

3. **Number of Nongendered Children**: The problem states there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. Therefore, the number of nongendered children is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

4. **Total Number of Children**: To find the total number of children, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:

   - Total: 25 + 15 = 40

2. **Number of people who left after an hour:**
   - 1/4 of the total number of people left.
   - 1/4 of 40 = 40 / 4 = 10 people left.

3. **Number of people remaining after an hour:**
   - Total remaining: 40 - 10 = 30 people.

4. **Number of men who stayed:**
   - 22 men stayed.

5. **Number of women who stayed:**

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. We know that Jam has a total of 26 pencils, with 2 of them being loose. This means the pencils in the boxes total 26 - 2 = 24 pencils. Since these 24 pencils are evenly distributed among three boxes, each box contains 24 / 3 = 8 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes Meg would need for her 46 pencils, assuming each box can hold 8 pencils. We divide 46 by 8 to find out how many full boxes Meg can fill and if there are any pencils left over. 46 / 8 = 5 with a remainder of 6. This means Meg needs 5 full boxes and 1 additional box for the 6 leftover pencils, totaling 6 boxes.

Now, we add the number of boxes Jam has to the number of boxes Meg needs. Jam has 3 boxes, and Meg needs 6 boxes, so together they need 3 + 6 = 9 boxes.

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon’s iced coffee is, we need to calculate the total amount of liquid added to the coffee, which includes both the ice cubes and the cream.

First, we calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, the number of ice cubes required is:

\[ \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Each ice cube adds 12 milliliters of water to the coffee, so the total amount of water added by the ice cubes is:

\[ \text{Water added by ice cubes} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters} \]

Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream. Therefore, the total amount of liquid added to the coffee is:

\[ \text{Total liquid added} = 60 \text{ milliliters (from ice cubes)} + 15 \text{ milliliters (cream)} = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of junior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees.
   - Number of junior programmers = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \).

2. **Determine the number of senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of senior programmers = Total employees - Number of junior programmers.
   - Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60.

3. **Determine the monthly salary of senior programmers:**
   - Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month.
   - Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers.
   - Monthly salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400 = $2400.

4. **Calculate the total monthly salary for junior programmers:**
   - Number of junior programmers = 40.
   - Monthly salary of each junior programmer = $2000.
   - Total monthly salary for junior programmers = 40 \times $2000 = $80,000.

5. **Calculate the total monthly salary for senior programmers:**
   - Number of senior programmers = 60.
   - Monthly salary of each senior programmer = $2400.
   - Total monthly salary for senior programmers = 60 \times $2400 = $144,000.

6. **Calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month:**
   - Total monthly salary for all programmers = Total monthly salary for junior programmers + Total monthly salary for senior programmers.
   - Total monthly salary for all programmers = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $224,000.

"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got in. Therefore, the number of people on the bus after the second stop is \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

Simplifying this, we get:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We are given that there were 20 people heading to the third stop, so:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has:
   24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 out to his friends, so he has:
   22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends. Since he gave 14 to his friends, he buys:
   2 * 14 = 28 lollipops.
5. Adding the new lollipops to what he has left, he now has:
   8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
6. He eats 3 more that night, so he has:
   36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left.
7. He eats 2 more in the morning, so he has:
   33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

"To determine the final value of Maria's shares, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial total cost of the shares.
2. Calculate the value of the shares after the first year's increase.
3. Calculate the value of the shares after the second year's decrease.

**Step 1: Initial total cost of the shares**
Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each.
Initial cost = 8 shares * $8/share = $64

**Step 2: Value after the first year's increase**
The stock price increases by 50%.
Increase = 50% of $8 = 0.50 * $8 = $4
New price per share = $8 + $4 = $12
Value after first year = 8 shares * $12/share = $96

**Step 3: Value after the second year's decrease**
The stock price decreases by 25%.
Decrease = 25% of $12 = 0.25 * $12 = $3
New price per share = $12 - $3 = $9
Value after second year = 8 shares * $9/share = $72

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group, therefore, has \( x - 10 \) students.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation to represent the total:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( C \) represent the number of cows and \( H \) represent the number of chickens. According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of animals is 60.
2. There are twice as many chickens as cows.

We can express these as the following equations:
\[ C + H = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times C) + (2 \times H) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times 20) + (2 \times 40) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is:

- The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
- The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, to find the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself, we add the weights together:

"To find out how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to first determine the total time he spent on his vacation. We know that the time he spent watching shows (3 shows at 2 hours each) is 30% of his total vacation time.

First, let's calculate the total time he spent watching shows:
3 shows * 2 hours/show = 6 hours

Since this is 30% of his total vacation time, we can set up the equation:

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost for one person to participate in all the activities and then see how many people can be accommodated within the $90 budget.

1. **Cost of one round of mini-golf:** $5
2. **Cost of arcade tokens:** $5
3. **Cost of two go-kart rides:** 2 * $10 = $20

The total cost for one person (including Morgan) to participate in all activities is:
\[ 5 + 5 + 20 = 30 \]

Now, we need to see how many people can be accommodated with the $90 budget:
\[ \frac{90}{30} = 3 \]

This means Morgan can invite 2 friends (since one of the 3 people is Morgan herself).

"To find out how much money Marisa puts in her piggy bank over 5 days, we need to calculate her daily savings and then multiply by the number of days.

First, let's calculate how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day:
- Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops.
- Total cost of lollipops per day = 4 lollipops * 25 cents/lollipop = 100 cents = $1.00

Next, we determine how much money she saves each day:
- Marisa gets $5.00 as pocket money each day.
- She spends $1.00 on lollipops.
- Daily savings = $5.00 - $1.00 = $4.00

Now, we calculate her total savings over 5 days:
- Daily savings = $4.00
- Total savings over 5 days = $4.00/day * 5 days = $20.00

So, Marisa puts $20.00 in her piggy bank over 5 days.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since each gumball costs $0.05 and he bought 40 gumballs, the total cost for the gumballs is:
   \[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

2. Billy spent half of his change on gumballs, which means the total change he had before buying gumballs was twice the amount he spent on gumballs:
   \[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

3. Since Billy started with $10 and had $4 left as change after buying candy, the amount he spent on candy is:
   \[ 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

4. The cost of candy is $1.50 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy he bought, we divide the amount he spent on candy by the cost per pound:
   \[ 6 \div 1.5 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \).

According to the problem, Carver is 5 years less than twice his son's age. This can be written as:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the train travels in one complete trip between the three cities, then multiply that by the number of trips it makes in a day, and finally determine how many days it can operate before reaching the 18,000-mile service interval.

1. Calculate the distance from the third city to the first city:
   - The combined distance from the first city to the second and then to the third is 75 miles + 100 miles = 175 miles.
   - The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than 175 miles, which is 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles.

2. Calculate the total distance for one complete trip:
   - The total distance for one trip is the sum of the distances between all cities: 75 miles + 100 miles + 125 miles = 300 miles.

3. Calculate the total distance traveled in one day:
   - The train makes 3 trips a day, so the total distance traveled in one day is 300 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 900 miles/day.

4. Determine how many days the train can operate before needing service:
   - The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it can operate, divide the service interval by the daily distance: 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days.

The train goes 20 days between services.

"To determine how many pounds of stuffing Mark needs, we first need to calculate the amount of stuffing required for a collie bed. A collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

The amount of stuffing for a Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds, and for a chihuahua bed, it is 2 pounds. The average is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of stuffing required for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds:

\[
\text{Total stuffing for 4 chihuahua beds} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]
\[
\text{Total stuffing for 3 collie beds} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks be \( x \). According to the problem, \( x = 3 \).

2. The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of people who refused to wear masks, minus 5. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   4x - 5
   \]
   Substituting \( x = 3 \):
   \[
   4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7
   \]

3. The number of people kicked out for physical violence is three times the number of shoplifters:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21
   \]

4. The total number of people kicked out is the sum of those kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence, plus those kicked out for other reasons. Let \( y \) be the number of people kicked out for other reasons. The total is given as 50:
   \[
   x + (4x - 5) + 3(4x - 5) + y = 50
   \]
   Substituting \( x = 3 \):
   \[
   3 + 7 + 21 + y = 50

"To find out how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to determine her total points after scoring and then subtract the 14 points she just scored.

First, we know that after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara. Sara has 8 points, so three times more than Sara's points is:

3 * 8 = 24 points

This means that after scoring 14 points, Erin has 24 points. To find out how many points Erin had before, we subtract the 14 points she scored:

24 - 14 = 10 points

So, Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points.

"To determine the monthly payment Karan has to make, we first need to calculate the total interest on the loan and then the total amount to be repaid, which includes both the principal and the interest. After that, we divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment.

1. **Calculate the interest:**
   The interest is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   Here, the principal (P) is $3,650, the rate (R) is 10% or 0.10, and the time (T) is 5 months. Since the interest rate is annual, we need to convert the time into years:
   \[
   \text{Time in years} = \frac{5 \text{ months}}{12 \text{ months/year}} = \frac{5}{12} \text{ years}
   \]
   Now, calculate the interest:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 = 152.08
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} = 3650 + 152.08 = 3802.08
   \]

3. **Calculate the monthly payment:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{\text{Total amount}}{\text{Number of months}} = \frac{3802.08}{5} = 760.42
   \]

Therefore, Karan has to pay $760.42 per month.

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up the problem as follows:

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially. According to the problem, he sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]

\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]

\[ x = 32 \]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many popsicles each person has based on the given ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. Together, they have 5 + 6 = 11 parts of the total number of popsicles.

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find out how many popsicles each part represents by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \text{Number of popsicles per part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number Sam has:

"To determine how much money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to streaming services, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services and then subtract this from the cost of the cable package.

1. **Cost of Netflix**: $10 per month.
2. **Cost of Hulu and Disney Plus**:
   - Normally, each service costs $10 per month.
   - Since Tim is bundling these services, he gets a 20% discount on each.
   - The discount on each service is 20% of $10, which is $2.
   - Therefore, the discounted price for each service is $10 - $2 = $8 per month.
   - The total cost for both Hulu and Disney Plus is $8 + $8 = $16 per month.

3. **Total cost of streaming services**:
   - Netflix: $10
   - Hulu and Disney Plus: $16

"To find the percentage of time Carol spent editing her song, we first need to calculate the total time she spent on all activities and then determine what portion of that time was spent editing.

1. Time spent writing the song: 4 hours
2. Time spent recording the song: 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
3. Time spent editing the song: 90 minutes, which is 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours

Now, let's add up the total time spent on all activities:
Total time = 4 hours (writing) + 2 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7.5 hours

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we use the formula:
Percentage of time spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total time) * 100

Substituting the values we have:
Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 / 7.5) * 100

Now, let's calculate the percentage:
Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 / 7.5) * 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20%

So, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing the song.

"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, let's break down the information step by step:

1. Erica initially made 20 Valentine's cards.
2. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards, with 15 cards in each box, so that's 2 * 15 = 30 cards.
3. Adding the cards she made to the pre-made cards, Erica had a total of 20 + 30 = 50 cards.
4. She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so she passed out a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.
5. Subtracting the cards she passed out from the total she had, Erica has 50 - 29 = 21 cards left.
6. She received 17 cards from family and friends, which adds to the number of cards she has.

So, the total number of cards Erica now has is 21 + 17 = 38.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The pizza has 12 slices in total.
2. Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since 1/3 of 12 is 4, Bill gets 4 slices.
3. Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. Since 1/4 of 12 is 3, Mark gets 3 slices.
4. Jenny eats 2 slices herself.

Now, let's calculate the total number of slices given away and eaten:

- Slices given to Bill: 4
- Slices given to Mark: 3
- Slices eaten by Jenny: 2

Total slices given away and eaten: 4 + 3 + 2 = 9

Finally, we subtract the total slices given away and eaten from the original number of slices:

12 - 9 = 3

So, the number of slices left is 3.

"To determine how many days Mark needs to save to buy a bike that costs $300, we first need to calculate the total amount he needs to save. Since he already has $50 in his bank account, the additional amount he needs is:

$300 - $50 = $250

Mark earns $10 per day. To find out how many days he needs to save $250, we divide the total amount he needs by his daily earnings:

$250 / $10/day = 25 days

Therefore, Mark needs to save for 25 days.

"To find the total number of bugs Nancy counted, let's break down the information given:

1. Nancy saw 90 spiders.
2. The number of millipedes is 1/3rd the number of spiders. So, the number of millipedes is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \).
3. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, the number of stink bugs is \( 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \).

Now, to find the total number of bugs, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs together:

\[ 90 \text{ (spiders)} + 30 \text{ (millipedes)} + 48 \text{ (stink bugs)} = 168 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of flour and milk needed for a quadruple batch:**
   - The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk.
   - For a quadruple batch, Mark needs:
     - Flour: \(3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups}\)
     - Milk: \(1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups}\)

2. **Calculate the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk required:**
   - Flour is sold in 2-cup bags.
     - Number of bags needed: \( \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bag}} = 6 \text{ bags}\)
   - Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles.
     - Number of bottles needed: \( \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bottle}} = 2 \text{ bottles}\)

3. **Determine how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy:**
   - Number of bags of flour: 6

"To determine how many kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days by reducing the time he uses the air conditioner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner:
   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour.
   - Mel uses it for 8 hours a day.
   - Daily energy consumption = 900 watts/hour * 8 hours/day = 7200 watt-hours/day.

2. Convert the daily energy consumption to kilowatt-hours (kWh):
   - 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) = 1000 watt-hours.
   - Daily energy consumption in kWh = 7200 watt-hours/day / 1000 = 7.2 kWh/day.

3. Calculate the energy consumption if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day:
   - New usage time = 8 hours/day - 5 hours/day = 3 hours/day.
   - New daily energy consumption = 900 watts/hour * 3 hours/day = 2700 watt-hours/day.
   - New daily energy consumption in kWh = 2700 watt-hours/day / 1000 = 2.7 kWh/day.

4. Calculate the daily energy savings:
   - Daily energy savings = Original daily consumption - New daily consumption.
   - Daily energy savings = 7.2 kWh/day - 2.7 kWh/day = 4.5 kWh/day.

5. Calculate the total energy savings over 30 days:
   - Total energy savings = Daily energy savings * 30 days.
   - Total energy savings = 4.5 kWh/day * 30 days = 135 kWh.

Therefore, Mel will save 135 kilowatts of electric energy in 30 days.

"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

Jane counts:
- Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\) stripes
- One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\) stripes
- One zebra with half as many stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes: \(36 / 2 = 18\) stripes

Now, we add up all the stripes:
\(34 + 36 + 18 = 88\) stripes

There are a total of 4 zebras, so to find the average number of stripes per zebra, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
\(88 / 4 = 22\)

The average number of stripes per zebra is 22.

"To determine how much Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we first need to calculate the number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people served per sandwich:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches, Tyson will need:

5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, and the cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound. So, the total cost for the meat and cheese is:

5 pounds of meat * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
5 pounds of cheese * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

Adding the cost of the meat and the cheese together gives us the total cost:

$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

Therefore, Tyson would spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Quantities:**
   - Allan has 40 cannolis.
   - There is twice as much corn as cannolis, so the number of corns is \(2 \times 40 = 80\).

2. **After Buying More Cannolis:**
   - Allan buys 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).

3. **New Quantity of Corns:**
   - Allan now has 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Since he has 100 cannolis, the number of corns is \(100 - 40 = 60\).

4. **Combined Total:**
   - The combined total of corns and cannolis is \(100 + 60 = 160\).

"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 5,000 steps. He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. This means he has taken a total of 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps so far. After his jog, he has 2,000 steps left to reach his goal. Therefore, the number of steps he has taken after the jog is 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps. To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we subtract the steps he had already taken before the jog from the total steps he had taken after the jog: 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps.

"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:

45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Next, we'll determine how long it will take Toby to read the book at his reading rate:

9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

Toby needs to account for the 10 minutes it takes to get to the airport, so the total time he needs to allocate for reading and traveling is:

30 minutes (reading) + 10 minutes (travel) = 40 minutes

Since Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport, we can calculate how many minutes early he will be:

60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

Toby will be 20 minutes early.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total payment for May.
2. Determine the number of employees who continued working in June.
3. Calculate the total payment for June.
4. Add the payments from May and June to get the total amount paid over the two months.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**

- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hours worked per week: 40
- Pay rate per hour: $15

Total payment for one employee in May:
\[ 40 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 160 \text{ hours} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$2400 \]

Total payment for all employees in May:
\[ 40 \text{ employees} \times \$2400/\text{employee} = \$96,000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of employees who continued working in June.**

- 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees continued working.
- Number of employees who continued working in June:
\[ 40 \text{ employees} \times \frac{3}{4} = 30 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for June.**

Total payment for one employee in June:
\[ 40 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 160 \text{ hours} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$2400 \]

Total payment for all employees in June:

"To determine how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of her purchases and subtract that from the $10 her parents gave her.

1. **Taffy Cost Calculation:**
   - The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off.""
   - The first pound costs $3.
   - The second pound is half off, so it costs $3 * 0.5 = $1.50.
   - Total cost for 2 pounds of taffy: $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

2. **Seashells Cost:**
   - The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

3. **Magnets Cost:**

"To find out how much Tim spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks after the discount and then add the cost of the finale firework.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the two packages of fireworks before the discount:
- The first package costs $400.
- The second package costs twice as much as the first, so it costs $400 * 2 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages before the discount is:
$400 + $800 = $1200.

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the $1200:
- A 20% discount means he pays 80% of the original price.
- 80% of $1200 is $1200 * 0.80 = $960.

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted price of the two packages:
$960 + $150 = $1110.

Therefore, Tim spent a total of $1110 on fireworks.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog. We know that Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of them will explode. Out of the candles that are more dangerous (the 1% that will explode), 5% also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

First, let's find out how many candles will explode:
1% of 50,000 candles = 0.01 * 50,000 = 500 candles

Next, we need to find out how many of these 500 exploding candles also smell like wet dog:
5% of 500 candles = 0.05 * 500 = 25 candles

So, 25 candles will both explode and smell like wet dog.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Joanne gathers an unknown number of apples from the average trees, let's call this number \( x \).

For her sister:
1. She gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. She gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. She gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ \text{Joanne's apples} + \text{Sister's apples} = 500 \]
\[ (30 + 15 + x) + (60 + 45 + 0) = 500 \]
\[ 45 + x + 105 = 500 \]
\[ 150 + x = 500 \]
\[ x = 500 - 150 \]
\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 180.
2. The total number of humps is 304.

We can write these as two equations:
1. \( C + D = 180 \) (since each animal has one head)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \) (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump)

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of \( C \) and \( D \).

First, we can solve the first equation for \( D \):
\[ D = 180 - C \]

Next, we substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[ 2C + (180 - C) = 304 \]
\[ 2C + 180 - C = 304 \]
\[ C + 180 = 304 \]
\[ C = 304 - 180 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we have \( C \), we can find \( D \) using the first equation:
\[ D = 180 - C \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is 56.

"To find out how big Timothy's locker is, we can start by determining the size of Zack's locker based on the information given about Peter's locker. We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and that it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. Therefore, we can calculate the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4:

Zack's locker size = Peter's locker size * 4
Zack's locker size = 5 cubic inches * 4
Zack's locker size = 20 cubic inches

Now that we know Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches, we can find out the size of Timothy's locker. We are told that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so we can calculate Timothy's locker size by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2:

Timothy's locker size = Zack's locker size * 2
Timothy's locker size = 20 cubic inches * 2
Timothy's locker size = 40 cubic inches

So, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

"To calculate the total cost of the streaming service for 2 years, we need to break down the costs into the different periods and then sum them up.

1. The first 6 months are at the special introductory rate of $8 per month.
   - Cost for the first 6 months: 6 months * $8/month = $48

2. The next 8 months are at the normal rate of $12 per month.
   - Cost for the next 8 months: 8 months * $12/month = $96

3. After the first 14 months (6 months + 8 months), the rate increases to $14 per month. Since 2 years is 24 months, there are 10 months left at this rate (24 months - 14 months).
   - Cost for the last 10 months: 10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, we add up all the costs to get the total cost for 2 years:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the original prices of the jeans:**
   - Let \( T \) be the original price of the tattered jeans.
   - Let \( J \) be the original price of the jogger jeans.
   - The tattered jeans are on sale for $28, so the discount on the tattered jeans is \( T - 28 \).
   - The jogger jeans are on sale for $22, so the discount on the jogger jeans is \( J - 22 \).

3. **Total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.
   - He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The savings from the tattered jeans is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the original prices:**
   - The discount on the tattered jeans is $4, so the original price \( T \) is \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The discount on the jogger jeans is $2, so the original price \( J \) is \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:**
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans. However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, which is a negative value in this context. The correct interpretation is that the tattered jeans originally cost $8 more than the jogger jeans.

"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles rented for the trip.

First, we calculate the capacity of the buses:
4 buses * 60 employees per bus = 240 employees

Next, we calculate the capacity of the minibusses:
6 minibusses * 30 employees per minibus = 180 employees

Then, we calculate the capacity of the minivans:
10 minivans * 15 employees per minivan = 150 employees

Finally, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles to get the total number of employees that can join the day trip:
240 employees (buses) + 180 employees (minibusses) + 150 employees (minivans) = 570 employees

"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders and the store-bought feeders separately, and then sum these numbers.

1. **Homemade Feeders:**
   - Lillian builds 3 homemade feeders.
   - Each homemade feeder attracts 20 birds plus an additional 10 birds, making it 30 birds per feeder.
   - Total birds attracted by homemade feeders: \(3 \times 30 = 90\).

2. **Store-Bought Feeders:**
   - Lillian buys 3 store-bought feeders.
   - Each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds.
   - Total birds attracted by store-bought feeders: \(3 \times 20 = 60\).

3. **Total Birds:**
   - Total birds attracted by all feeders: \(90 + 60 = 150\).

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

"To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner, let's break down the costs of each item she ordered:

1. **Bagel**: The cost of the bagel is given as $4.
2. **Soup**: The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find the cost of the soup:
   \[
   \text{Cost of soup} = \text{Cost of bagel} + 25\% \times \text{Cost of bagel}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of soup} = 4 + 0.25 \times 4 = 4 + 1 = 5
   \]
   So, the soup costs $5.
3. **Cake**: The cake costs half the price of the bagel. To find the cost of the cake:
   \[
   \text{Cost of cake} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of bagel} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2
   \]
   So, the cake costs $2.

Now, we add up the costs of all the items to find the total cost:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of bagel} + \text{Cost of soup} + \text{Cost of cake} = 4 + 5 + 2 = 11
\]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered.

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( C \).

Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards, so he sells 2/3 of his cards. The amount of money he makes from selling the cards is the number of cards he sells multiplied by the price per card, which is $1.5.

The money from selling the cards is:
\[ \text{Money from selling cards} = \left(\frac{2}{3}C\right) \times 1.5 \]

Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 left over, so the total amount of money he makes from selling the cards is $150. We can set up the equation:
\[ \left(\frac{2}{3}C\right) \times 1.5 = 150 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C = \frac{150}{1.5} \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C = 100 \]
\[ C = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} \]
\[ C = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The caterer was initially preparing for 36 guests.
2. He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. This means he prepared for 18 guests to have two hotdogs and the other 18 guests to have one hotdog.
3. The total number of hotdogs prepared is therefore:
   - 18 guests * 2 hotdogs each = 36 hotdogs
   - 18 guests * 1 hotdog each = 18 hotdogs
   - Total = 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs

4. However, 40 guests showed up, and each wanted a second hotdog. This means each of the 40 guests wanted 2 hotdogs.
5. The total number of hotdogs needed for 40 guests, each having 2 hotdogs, is:
   - 40 guests * 2 hotdogs each = 80 hotdogs

6. The caterer only had 54 hotdogs prepared, so the number of hotdogs short is:
   - 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs

7. Since each guest who did not get a second hotdog is missing 1 hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26.

"To find out how much Charlotte's order was after the 20% discount, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. 

The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.
The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
The cost of the 5 utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Adding these together, the total cost before the discount is:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Now, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost.

The amount she pays is 80% of $165.00, which is:
0.80 * $165.00 = $132.00.

So, the final cost of her order is $132.00.

"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy:

- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Dora has:

- Money saved from allowance: $2
- Money given by her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, we subtract the total money Dora has from the total cost of the items:

$19 - $18 = $1

Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount George spent:**
   - George had 1% of his money left, which means he spent 99% of his money.
   - If $5 is 100%, then 99% of $5 is \( 5 \times 0.99 = 4.95 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost of the chips:**
   - George bought 3 bags of chips, and each bag costs 40 cents.
   - The total cost for the chips is \( 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \) dollars.

3. **Determine the amount spent on candy bars:**
   - The total amount spent is $4.95.
   - The amount spent on chips is $1.20.
   - The amount spent on candy bars is \( 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the number of candy bars:**
   - Each candy bar costs 75 cents, or $0.75.

"To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we first need to calculate the total number of oranges that Sitti and Juris have together. Sitti has 34 oranges, and Juris has 22 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is:

34 (Sitti's oranges) + 22 (Juris's oranges) = 56 oranges

Next, we need to divide the total number of oranges equally among Sitti, Juris, and their 6 other friends. This means the oranges will be shared among 8 people (Sitti, Juris, and the 6 friends).

So, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of people:

56 oranges ÷ 8 people = 7 oranges per person

Therefore, everyone will get 7 oranges.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Wayne's travel time:** Wayne's travel time to the theater is 4 minutes.

2. **Determine Bernadette's travel time:** Since Bernadette's travel time is four times Wayne's travel time, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Bernadette's travel time} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Determine the time difference needed for Bernadette to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne:** 
   - Wayne arrives at the theater at time \( T \).
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to arrive at \( T - 5 \) minutes.
   - Since Bernadette's travel time is 16 minutes, she needs to leave 16 minutes before \( T - 5 \).

4. **Calculate the total time Bernadette needs to leave before Wayne:**
   - Wayne leaves at time \( T - 4 \) (since his travel time is 4 minutes).
   - Bernadette needs to leave at \( T - 5 - 16 = T - 21 \).

5. **Determine the difference in their departure times:**
   - Wayne leaves at \( T - 4 \).
   - Bernadette leaves at \( T - 21 \).
   - The difference in their departure times is:
     \[
     (T - 4) - (T - 21) = 21 - 4 = 17 \text{ minutes}

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. We know the area of the room and the length, so we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Given:
- The area of the room is 360 square feet.
- The length of the room is 3 yards. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length in feet is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) feet.

Now, we can solve for the width:

\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{Width} \]

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet.

"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 beads, so:
- Red beads: 1 pack * 20 beads/pack = 20 beads
- Clear beads: 2 packs * 20 beads/pack = 40 beads

Total beads Elizabeth bought = 20 beads (red) + 40 beads (clear) = 60 beads

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

Each pack contains 20 beads, so:
- Blue beads: 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads
- Red beads: 4 packs * 20 beads/pack = 80 beads

Total beads Margareth bought = 60 beads (blue) + 80 beads (red) = 140 beads

Now, we find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters:
140 beads (Margareth) - 60 beads (Elizabeth) = 80 beads

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of the Super Ticket**: $20
2. **Cost of the Movie Ticket**: $12
3. **Cost of the Soda**: $3
4. **Savings**: $2

If you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2, it means the total cost of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda was $2 less than the cost of the super ticket plus the extra $1 for the popcorn and soda.

Let's denote the regular price of the popcorn as \( P \).

The total cost of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda is:
\[ 12 + P + 3 \]

The cost of the super ticket plus the extra $1 for the popcorn and soda is:
\[ 20 + 1 = 21 \]

According to the problem, you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket:
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 21 - 2 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 19 \]
\[ 15 + P = 19 \]
\[ P = 19 - 15 \]
\[ P = 4 \]

So, the regular price of the popcorn is \( \boxed{4} \)."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the original cost per balloon before the price increase. We know that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of balloons}} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \]

So, the original cost per balloon was $45.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = \text{Original cost per balloon} + 20 = 45 + 20 = 65 \]

Now, we need to calculate how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons at the new price:

\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = \text{New cost per balloon} \times \text{Number of balloons} = 65 \times 170 = 11050 \]

Therefore, Bentley paid $11,050 to fill 170 balloons after the price increase.

Volume of one bed = 2 feet (width) * 8 feet (length) * 2 feet (height) = 32 cubic feet

Step 2: Total volume of soil needed
Total volume = Volume of one bed * Number of beds
Total volume = 32 cubic feet/bed * 10 beds = 320 cubic feet

Step 3: Number of bags of potting soil required
Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil.
Number of bags = Total volume / Volume per bag
Number of bags = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags

Step 4: Total cost
Each bag costs $12.
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
Total cost = 160 bags * $12/bag = $1920

The total cost for the potting soil will be $1920.

"To find the total number of cards, we first need to determine the number of green and yellow cards based on the information provided.

1. **Red Cards**: There are 15 red cards.

2. **Green Cards**: There are 60% more green cards than red cards. To find the number of green cards, we calculate 60% of 15 and add it to 15:
   \[
   \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + (0.60 \times 15) = 15 + 9 = 24
   \]

3. **Yellow Cards**: The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the number of red and green cards:
   \[
   \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 = 39
   \]

4. **Total Number of Cards**: To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards together:
   \[
   \text{Total number of cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

Total number of puppies = Jennifer's puppies + Brandon's puppies
Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Total number of puppies with spots = Jennifer's spotted puppies + Brandon's spotted puppies
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, to find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

Percentage of puppies with spots = (Total number of puppies with spots / Total number of puppies) * 100

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100

Let's calculate the percentage:

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed. After that, we can divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find out how many trips are necessary.

1. **Sugar cubes**: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
2. **Carrots**: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
3. **Hay**: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
4. **Oats**: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed:

Total weight = 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats)
Total weight = 4500 pounds

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip
Number of trips = 2

Since the number of trips is a whole number, the farmer will need exactly 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To find out how many cents Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate the weekly earnings from both the aluminum cans and the plastic bottles, and then multiply by four.

First, let's calculate the weekly earnings:
- Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week, and each can is worth 2 cents. So, the weekly earnings from cans are 3 cans * 2 cents/can = 6 cents.
- Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week, and each bottle is worth 3 cents. So, the weekly earnings from bottles are 5 bottles * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents.

Now, let's add the weekly earnings from cans and bottles:
- Total weekly earnings = 6 cents (from cans) + 15 cents (from bottles) = 21 cents.

Finally, to find the earnings for a four-week month, we multiply the total weekly earnings by 4:
- Monthly earnings = 21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents.

"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to follow the information given step by step.

First, we determine how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

60% of 10 plants = 0.60 * 10 = 6 plants

So, Toni has 10 plants (Frederick's amount) + 6 plants (the additional 60%) = 16 plants.

Next, we need to find out how many plants Shondra has. Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. Since Toni has 16 plants:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7 = 9 plants

Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants.

"First, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has:

6 decks * 25 cards/deck = 150 basketball cards

Next, we calculate the total number of baseball cards:

5 boxes * 40 cards/box = 200 baseball cards

Now, we add the basketball and baseball cards to find the total number of cards:

150 basketball cards + 200 baseball cards = 350 cards

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so we subtract those from the total:

350 cards - 50 cards = 300 cards

These 300 cards are the ones she gives to her students. If each student gets 10 cards, we can find the number of students by dividing the number of cards given away by the number of cards each student receives:

300 cards / 10 cards/student = 30 students

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost for both Becky and Kelly, taking into account the discounts they received, and then find the difference between the two amounts.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Becky:
- Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each.
- The total cost before the discount is \( 20 \times 45 \) cents.
- This equals \( 900 \) cents or \( 9 \) dollars.
- Becky received a $1 discount, so the final cost for Becky is \( 9 - 1 = 8 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for Kelly:
- Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each.
- The total cost before the discount is \( 20 \times 50 \) cents.
- This equals \( 1000 \) cents or \( 10 \) dollars.
- Kelly received a 10 percent discount, so the discount amount is \( 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \) dollar.
- The final cost for Kelly is \( 10 - 1 = 9 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference between what Kelly paid and what Becky paid:
- Kelly paid \( 9 \) dollars.
- Becky paid \( 8 \) dollars.
- The difference is \( 9 - 8 = 1 \) dollar.

So, Kelly paid $1 more than Becky.

"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry for 80 rooms, we need to calculate the number of each type of laundry item per room and then multiply by the number of rooms.

1. **Sheets per room**: Each room has 2 sheets.
2. **Comforters per room**: Each room has 1 comforter.
3. **Pillow cases per room**: Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so 2 sheets * 2 = 4 pillow cases.
4. **Towels per room**: Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so 4 pillow cases * 2 = 8 towels.

Now, we sum up the total number of each type of laundry item per room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforters: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

Total items per room = 2 (sheets) + 1 (comforter) + 4 (pillow cases) + 8 (towels) = 15 items per room.

For 80 rooms, the total number of items is:
15 items/room * 80 rooms = 1200 items.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Frank starts with 200 shoes.
2. On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since a pair is 2 shoes, he gets 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.
3. On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
4. On Friday, he gains 30 pairs, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.
5. On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of shoes he has on Sunday:

Starting shoes: 200
Shoes after Monday: 200 + 10 = 210
Shoes after Wednesday: 210 + 30 = 240

"To determine how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set the equation equal to 5:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the shark's length and the remoras' lengths to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet and the remoras' lengths in inches, we will convert the shark's length to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.
2. Calculate the total length of the remoras.
3. Divide the total length of the remoras by the shark's length in inches to get the fraction of the shark's length that the remoras represent.
4. Convert this fraction to a percentage by multiplying by 100.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Shark's length in inches: 10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches
2. Total length of the remoras: 2 * 6 inches = 12 inches
3. Fraction of the shark's length: 12 inches / 120 inches = 0.1

"To find out how many kids in Gina's class are not allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

First, we add the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number of kids allergic to peanuts:
9 (dairy) + 6 (peanuts) = 15

However, this sum counts the kids who are allergic to both dairy and peanuts twice, so we need to subtract the number of kids who are allergic to both:
15 - 3 = 12

This means that 12 kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. To find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we subtract this number from the total number of kids in the class:
32 (total kids) - 12 (allergic to dairy or peanuts) = 20

So, 20 kids are not allergic to anything.

3. **Applying the Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - Subtract the coupon from the cost of 2 packs:
     \[
     \$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00
     \]

4. **Total Number of Razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - Heather buys 2 packs, so the total number of razors is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors per pack} = 8 \text{ razors}
     \]

5. **Cost Per Razor:**
   - The total cost for 8 razors is $2.00.
   - The cost per razor is:
     \[
     \frac{\$2.00}{8 \text{ razors}} = \$0.25 \text{ per razor}
     \]

6. **Convert to Cents:**
   - $0.25 is equivalent to 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor after all discounts is:

"To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to add up the heights of the cheerleaders, starting from the bottom and moving to the top.

The pyramid structure is as follows:
- 4 cheerleaders on the bottom
- 3 cheerleaders on the next level
- 2 cheerleaders on the next level
- 1 cheerleader at the top

Given that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall and the 10th is 60 inches tall, the shortest girl (60 inches) will be at the top.

The height of the pyramid is the sum of the heights of the cheerleaders, which is:
- 4 cheerleaders at 64 inches each: \(4 \times 64 = 256\) inches
- 3 cheerleaders at 64 inches each: \(3 \times 64 = 192\) inches
- 2 cheerleaders at 64 inches each: \(2 \times 64 = 128\) inches
- 1 cheerleader at 60 inches: \(1 \times 60 = 60\) inches

Adding these together:
\[256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636\] inches

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[636 \div 12 = 53\] feet

Therefore, the height of the human pyramid is 53 feet.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.
3. At that time, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. So, Angela will be 3 * 14 = 42 years old in four years.
4. To find out how old Angela is right now, we subtract 4 years from her age in four years: 42 - 4 = 38.

Angela is currently 38 years old.

"To find out how much money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the cost of the morning rides:
   - Paul drives in the morning twice a day, and each ride costs $6.
   - The cost for one day of morning rides is 2 rides/day * $6/ride = $12/day.
   - For 14 days, the total cost of morning rides is 14 days * $12/day = $168.

2. Calculate the cost of the afternoon rides:
   - Paul drives in the afternoon twice a day, and each ride costs $2.
   - The cost for one day of afternoon rides is 2 rides/day * $2/ride = $4/day.
   - For 14 days, the total cost of afternoon rides is 14 days * $4/day = $56.

3. Add the total costs of morning and afternoon rides to get the total cost:
   - Total cost = cost of morning rides + cost of afternoon rides
   - Total cost = $168 + $56 = $224.

Therefore, Paul spent $224 on driving his car during these two weeks.

"To determine how many Greek orange pies Brianne and Ashley can make, we first need to calculate the total number of oranges they have.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box:
5 boxes * 10 oranges/box = 50 oranges

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley:
50 oranges + 20 oranges = 70 oranges

The total number of oranges they have together is:
50 oranges (Ashley) + 70 oranges (Brianne) = 120 oranges

Each Greek orange pie requires 3 oranges, so the number of pies they can make is:
120 oranges / 3 oranges/pie = 40 pies

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation where the total cost of each venue is the same.

Let \( x \) be the number of guests.

**Cost for the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per person
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost for the second venue:**
- Cost per person: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We set the total costs equal to each other to find the number of guests \( x \) where the costs are the same:

\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

"To solve this problem, let's set up some equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( B \) represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
2. David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found \( \frac{B}{2} \) insects.
3. Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( \frac{B}{2} + 7 \) insects.
4. Together, they found 43 insects, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   B + \frac{B}{2} + \left(\frac{B}{2} + 7\right) = 43
   \]

Now, let's simplify and solve for \( B \):

\[
B + \frac{B}{2} + \frac{B}{2} + 7 = 43
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
B + B + 7 = 43
\]

\[
2B + 7 = 43
\]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[
2B = 36
\]

Divide by 2:

\[
B = 18
\]

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find out how many David and Lily found:

- David found \( \frac{B}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) insects.
- Lily found \( \frac{B}{2} + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \) insects.

So, Lily found 16 insects.

"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to add the fractions of the skein they each used and then multiply by the total number of yards in a skein.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein. First, we add these fractions:

1/4 + 1/2 = 1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4

This means they used 3/4 of a skein of yarn together. Now, we need to find out how many yards 3/4 of a skein is. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we multiply 364 by 3/4:

364 * 3/4 = 364 * 0.75 = 273

So, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"To find out how many gifts Cherrie bought in total, we need to calculate the number of gifts for each group of friends and then add the extra gifts she decided to buy.

First, for the 2 friends who each want 5 gifts:
2 friends * 5 gifts per friend = 10 gifts

Next, for the 3 friends who each want 2 gifts:
3 friends * 2 gifts per friend = 6 gifts

Now, we add the 10 extra random gifts:
10 extra gifts

Adding all the gifts together:
10 gifts (for the first 2 friends) + 6 gifts (for the other 3 friends) + 10 extra gifts = 26 gifts

So, Cherrie bought a total of 26 gifts.

"To find the length of the couch, we first need to determine the width of the rug and then use that to find the length of the couch.

1. The chair is 3 feet wide.
2. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so the width of the rug is 3 feet + 5 feet = 8 feet.
3. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. So, the length of the couch is 2 * 8 feet + 2 feet = 16 feet + 2 feet = 18 feet.

The couch is 18 feet long.

"To find out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost, let's break down the information given:

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. Two of these packs were strawberry flavored.
3. One pack was grape flavored, which cost $2.
4. One pack was green apple flavored, which cost half as much as the grape pack, so it cost $2 / 2 = $1.
5. The total cost for all the packs was $7.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \).

The total cost can be represented as:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]
\[ 2S = 7 - 3 \]
\[ 2S = 4 \]
\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

"To determine the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the number of sticks he can get from each type of wood and then see how many of each he can buy with his $24.

First, let's calculate the number of sticks per dollar for each type of wood:
- A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and provides 200 sticks. So, the number of sticks per dollar is \( \frac{200 \text{ sticks}}{4 \text{ dollars}} = 50 \text{ sticks per dollar} \).
- A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and provides 400 sticks. So, the number of sticks per dollar is \( \frac{400 \text{ sticks}}{6 \text{ dollars}} \approx 66.67 \text{ sticks per dollar} \).

Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood provides more sticks per dollar, it is the more cost-effective option. However, the question asks for the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber, which is the 2 x 4 piece of wood.

Now, let's calculate how many 2 x 4 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with $24:
- Each 2 x 4 piece costs $4, so with $24, he can buy \( \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars per piece}} = 6 \text{ pieces} \).

Next, we calculate the total number of sticks he can get from 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood:
- Each piece provides 200 sticks, so 6 pieces provide \( 6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks} \).

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make if he buys the cheapest lumber is 1200.

"To determine the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs and the cost per pair.

Step 1: Total number of legs
Each dog has 4 legs, and Mario has 6 dogs.
Total legs = 4 legs/dog * 6 dogs = 24 legs

Step 2: Number of pairs of snowshoes
Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2 to find the number of pairs.
Number of pairs = 24 legs / 2 legs/pair = 12 pairs

Step 3: Total cost
Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
Total cost = 12 pairs * $12.00/pair = $144.00

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $144.00.

"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we first need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day, and each trip costs $2.20. Therefore, the cost per day for her bus trips is:
\[ 2 \times 2.20 = 4.40 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she takes these trips five days a week, the total cost for the week is:
\[ 4.40 \times 5 = 22.00 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of a weekly bus pass is $20.00. To find out how much she saves, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of her bus trips:
\[ 22.00 - 20.00 = 2.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Janet would save:
\[ 2.00 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. Since the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has \(20 / 2 = 10\) sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals on the farm and in the zoo:

- Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
- Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

Combined, the farm and the zoo have:

40 (farm) + 80 (zoo) = 120 animals

"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to determine the quantities based on the information that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the amount that Sophia bought, we can set up the following equations:

- Let \( O \) be the number of onions Sophia bought.
- Let \( P \) be the number of potatoes Sophia bought.

According to the problem, Rose's purchases are 4 times those of Sophia's, so:
- \( 4O = 12 \) (for onions)
- \( 4P = 4 \) (for potatoes)

We can solve these equations to find \( O \) and \( P \):

1. \( 4O = 12 \)
   \[
   O = \frac{12}{4} = 3
   \]

2. \( 4P = 4 \)
   \[
   P = \frac{4}{4} = 1
   \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add these together:

\[
3 + 1 = 4
\]

Therefore, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes.

"To calculate the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to reach his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of days Andy has to reach his goal.
2. Calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 lbs.
3. Divide the total number of calories by the number of days to find the daily calorie deficit.

Step 1: Calculate the number of days from December 31st to July 19th.
- December 31st to January 1st is 1 day.
- January has 31 days.
- February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year).
- March has 31 days.
- April has 30 days.
- May has 31 days.
- June has 30 days.
- July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.

Adding these together: 1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 201 days.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of calories to lose 30 lbs.
- 1 pound = 3500 calories.
- 30 pounds = 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

Step 3: Calculate the daily calorie deficit.
- Daily calorie deficit = Total calories to lose / Number of days.
- Daily calorie deficit = 105,000 calories / 201 days ≈ 522.39 calories.

Since Andy can't burn a fraction of a calorie, we'll round to the nearest whole number.

"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah will need to drink, we first need to calculate the total distance she will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she needs to run 8 laps, we can calculate the total distance as follows:

Total distance = Number of laps × Distance per lap
Total distance = 8 laps × 0.25 km/lap
Total distance = 2 km

Now that we know the total distance, we can calculate the amount of water she needs to drink. Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs, so:

Total water needed = Total distance × Water per kilometer
Total water needed = 2 km × 60 ml/km
Total water needed = 120 ml

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Now, solve for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house:

\[ H = 3L \]
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost $90,000.

\[ \text{Cookies made by Josh} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 \]
\[ \text{Cookies made by Josh} = 9 \]

Next, the problem states that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we calculate the number of cookies Kelsie made as follows:

\[ \text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times \text{Cookies made by Josh} \]
\[ \text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times 9 \]
\[ \text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 18 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of chairs Ophelia has:**
   - Ophelia has 20 sofas.
   - Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs.
   - Therefore, Ophelia has \(20 + 2 = 22\) chairs.

2. **Determine the number of chairs Jenna has:**
   - Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia.
   - Therefore, Jenna has \(3 \times 22 = 66\) chairs.

3. **Determine the number of sofas Jenna has:**
   - Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs.
   - Therefore, Jenna has \(66 - 2 = 64\) sofas.

4. **Calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:**
   - Ophelia's total: \(20\) sofas + \(22\) chairs = \(42\)
   - Jenna's total: \(64\) sofas + \(66\) chairs = \(130\)
   - Combined total: \(42 + 130 = 172\)

The total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is 172.

"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not purchased the headphone set, we first need to determine the cost of the headphone set. We know that Tom paid a total of $48 for both the CD and the headphone set, and the CD cost $4.

The cost of the headphone set can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Cost of headphone set} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Cost of CD} \]
\[ \text{Cost of headphone set} = 48 - 4 = 44 \]

Now, to find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set, we divide the cost of the headphone set by the cost of one CD:
\[ \text{Number of additional CDs} = \frac{\text{Cost of headphone set}}{\text{Cost of one CD}} \]
\[ \text{Number of additional CDs} = \frac{44}{4} = 11 \]

So, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had not bought the headphone set.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we can break down the information given:

- For 5 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week.
- For 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week.
- For 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours.

First, we calculate the total hours for the 5 weeks where he worked out 4 hours each week:
5 weeks * 4 hours/week = 20 hours

Next, we calculate the total hours for the 2 weeks where he worked out 5 hours each week:
2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours

Finally, for the 1 week where he worked out 6 hours:
1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

Now, we add all these hours together to get the total:
20 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 36 hours

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of people on the bus is now:
   \( 48 - 8 = 40 \)
3. Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 times 8 is:
   \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \)
   So, 40 people get on the bus, and the number of people on the bus is now:
   \( 40 + 40 = 80 \)
4. On the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of people on the bus is now:
   \( 80 - 21 = 59 \)
5. Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. ""3 times fewer"" means one-third of the number who got off, which is:
   \( \frac{21}{3} = 7 \)
   So, 7 people get on the bus, and the number of people on the bus is now:
   \( 59 + 7 = 66 \)

Therefore, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is 66.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \).

2. **Determine Jame's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.

3. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, the cousin's age in 8 years will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \).

4. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If the cousin will be 55 in 8 years, the cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \).

5. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - The current age difference is \( 47 - 22 = 25 \).

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is 25.

"To find the cost of one monitor, let's break down the information given:

1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
2. The computer costs $1,100.
3. The printer costs $400 less than the computer, so the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 monitors. We can do this by subtracting the cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost:

Total cost of 2 monitors = Total cost - Cost of computer - Cost of printer
Total cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - $1,100 - $700
Total cost of 2 monitors = $600

Since this is the cost for 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor would be half of that:

Cost of one monitor = Total cost of 2 monitors / 2
Cost of one monitor = $600 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $300

So, one monitor costs $300.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of boys and girls:**
   - There are 20 kids in total, and they are divided into two equal groups of girls and boys.
   - Therefore, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

2. **Calculate the number of seashells brought by each boy:**
   - Each boy brought back 60 shells.

3. **Calculate the number of seashells brought by each girl:**
   - Each girl brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.
   - This can be expressed as: \( 60 + 4 \times 60 \).

4. **Perform the calculation:**
   - \( 60 + 4 \times 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 \).

So, each girl brought back 300 seashells.

"To find out how old Anne is, we first need to determine Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4 years
Alyana's age = 10 years - 4 years
Alyana's age = 6 years

Now, we know that Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. So, we can calculate Anne's age as follows:

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2 years
Anne's age = 6 years + 2 years
Anne's age = 8 years

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old.

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to add the thickness of each book together. Let's break it down:

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 mm = 62 mm thick.

Now, we add the thickness of all four books together:

31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm

18 vlogs (first week) + 21 vlogs (second week) + 15 vlogs (third week) = 54 vlogs

Now, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her monthly goal:

72 vlogs (monthly goal) - 54 vlogs (already made) = 18 vlogs

Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs for the month.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly saving target of $1125, given that he saves twice as much daily in the second half as in the first half.

April has 30 days, so the first half of the month consists of 15 days, and the second half also consists of 15 days.

Let's denote the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of the month as \( x \). Therefore, in the first half of the month, he saves \( 15x \).

In the second half of the month, he saves twice as much each day, so he saves \( 2x \) per day. Over the 15 days in the second half, he saves \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings from the first half and the second half:
\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

We know that the total savings for the month should be $1125:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of the month. In the second half, he saves twice this amount:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 each day in the second half of the month.

"To find out how much change Verna received, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits she bought and then subtract that from the $20 she gave.

First, let's calculate the cost of each type of fruit:
- The cost of the apples is 3 apples * $1.50/apple = $4.50
- The cost of the oranges is 5 oranges * $0.80/orange = $4.00
- The cost of the peaches is 6 peaches * $0.75/peach = $4.50

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:
Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50
Total cost = $13.00

Verna gave $20, so the change she received is:
Change = Amount given - Total cost
Change = $20 - $13.00
Change = $7.00

So, Verna received $7.00 in change.

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( B \) represent the amount of money Brad gets. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \).

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

So, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

"To find out how many miles Jeff walks in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the distance Jeff walks in one day: Since Jeff's work is 3 miles away, he walks 3 miles to get there and 3 miles to get back. So, in one day, he walks a total of 3 miles + 3 miles = 6 miles.

2. Calculate the distance Jeff walks in one week: Since Jeff works 5 times a week, we multiply the distance he walks in one day by the number of days he works in a week. So, 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week.

Therefore, Jeff walks 30 miles in a week.

1. **Determine Ray's swimming time for 1 mile in warm water:**
   - When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.
   - When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold.
   - Twice the time it takes to swim a mile in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
   - Adding 2 minutes to this time gives \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.

2. **Calculate the time to swim 3 miles in cold water:**

"To find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we first need to determine each of their weights.

1. Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds.
2. Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so:
   Susan's weight = Mark's weight - 20 pounds
   Susan's weight = 150 pounds - 20 pounds
   Susan's weight = 130 pounds

3. Bob's weight is twice as much as Susan's, so:
   Bob's weight = 2 * Susan's weight
   Bob's weight = 2 * 130 pounds
   Bob's weight = 260 pounds

Now, to find the average weight, we add the weights of all three friends and divide by the number of friends:

Average weight = (Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight) / 3
Average weight = (150 pounds + 130 pounds + 260 pounds) / 3
Average weight = 540 pounds / 3
Average weight = 180 pounds

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the angle the sun moves relative to the ground, not just the pyramid. The sun moves 5 degrees an hour straight upward from the pyramid, and it does so for 10 hours. This means the sun will have moved 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees from the tip of the pyramid.

Since the pyramid itself is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground, we need to add this angle to the angle the sun has moved to find the total angle from the ground to the sun.

Total angle from the ground to the sun = angle of the pyramid + angle the sun has moved

- Therefore, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we need to convert the total reading time into the number of pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- The number of pages she reads per minute is \( \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \).

Now, we calculate the number of pages read in the first week:
- \( 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \).

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

Finally, we add the pages read in both weeks:
- \( 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \).

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( n \) be the current age of Shiloh's nephew.

In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, in 7 years, his nephew will be \( n + 7 \) years old.

The equation based on the given information is:
\[ 51 = 3(n + 7) \]

Now, let's solve for \( n \):

\[ 51 = 3(n + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3n + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3n \]
\[ 30 = 3n \]
\[ n = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"To find out how much money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we can break down the payments as follows:

1. For the first tooth, Sharon received $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, Sharon received $1.00 each, so for three teeth, that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half of $1.00, which is $0.50, for each tooth. So for two teeth, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, we add up all the payments:

$5.00 (first tooth) + $3.00 (next three teeth) + $1.00 (last two teeth) = $9.00

So, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is:

"To determine how many total action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the number of wooden and plastic action figures he buys and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the amount of money Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. There are 4 days in this period, and he spends an equal amount each day. The total amount of money he has is $70, and he will spend this equally over 7 days, so each day he spends:

\[ \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Since he spends $10 each day on wooden action figures for 4 days, the total amount spent on wooden action figures is:

\[ 10 \times 4 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Each wooden action figure costs $5, so the number of wooden action figures he buys is:

\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ wooden action figures} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of money he has left after buying the wooden action figures:

\[ 70 - 40 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

For the remaining 3 days (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures, which cost $2 each. Since he spends $10 each day, the total amount spent on plastic action figures is:

\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Each plastic action figure costs $2, so the number of plastic action figures he buys is:

\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ plastic action figures} \]

Finally, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is the sum of the wooden and plastic action figures:

\[ 8 + 15 = 23 \]

"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we first need to calculate the total number of roses required by the flower shops and the number of roses Ford can supply in a month.

1. Calculate the total number of roses required by the flower shops per week:
   - First shop: 20 roses
   - Second shop: 15 roses
   - Third shop: 30 roses
   Total per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

2. Calculate the total number of roses required by the flower shops per month (assuming 4 weeks in a month):
   Total per month = 65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses

3. Calculate the number of roses Ford can supply per month:
   - Ford grows 40 roses per week
   Total per month = 40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses

4. Determine the shortage:
   Shortage = Total required per month - Total supplied per month
   Shortage = 260 roses - 160 roses = 100 roses

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw each day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the seven days and then divide that number by 7 (the number of days).

First, let's add up the total number of birds:
- Days one and two: 50 birds
- Day three: 0 birds
- Days four and five: 120 birds
- Day six: 20 birds
- Day seven: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

Now, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days to find the average:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then apply that percentage to the desired temperature of 520 degrees.

First, let's find the percentage error in the oven's temperature setting. The oven is set to 450 degrees, but it reaches 468 degrees. The difference is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \text{ degrees} \]

The percentage error is then:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is 4% hotter than the set temperature. To find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to for a desired temperature of 520 degrees, we need to account for this 4% increase.

Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set the oven to. The actual temperature will be \( x + 0.04x = 1.04x \). We want this to equal 520 degrees:

\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]

\[ x = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set the oven to 500 degrees.

"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, the first movie is:
1 hour * 60 minutes/hour + 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. So, the second movie is:
2 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Now, we add the duration of both movies together:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

"To find out how much each pair of contacts will cost Pete if he buys 2 boxes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost for 2 boxes of contacts with the 10% discount.
2. Determine the total number of contacts Pete will get from 2 boxes.
3. Divide the total cost by the total number of contacts to find the cost per contact.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The original price for 1 box is $100.00. With a 10% discount, the price for 1 box is:
   \[ 100.00 - (100.00 \times 0.10) = 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]
   So, the price for 1 box with the discount is $90.00.
   For 2 boxes, the total cost is:
   \[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

2. Each box contains 90 contacts, so 2 boxes will contain:
   \[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \]
   contacts.

3. To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
   \[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per contact is $1.00.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. We can express these relationships as follows:

- Number of red jelly beans, \( R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \)
- Number of green jelly beans, \( G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \)

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \):

\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms:

\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

- Number of red jelly beans, \( R = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Number of green jelly beans, \( G = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents, since each gumball costs 5 cents (a nickel).

- Quarters: 8 quarters * 25 cents/quarter = 200 cents
- Dimes: 6 dimes * 10 cents/dime = 60 cents
- Nickels: 14 nickels * 5 cents/nickel = 70 cents
- Pennies: 15 pennies * 1 cent/penny = 15 cents

Now, we add up all the cents:

200 cents (from quarters) + 60 cents (from dimes) + 70 cents (from nickels) + 15 cents (from pennies) = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:

345 cents / 5 cents/gumball = 69 gumballs

"To find the total number of legs, we need to consider the number of legs each type of animal has and then multiply that by the number of each type of animal in the store.

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 * 4 = 20 legs.
Cats also have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 * 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 * 2 = 20 legs.

Adding these together, the total number of legs is 20 (from dogs) + 8 (from cats) + 20 (from birds) = 48 legs.

"Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He increases the weight by 50%, which means he adds 50% of 8 pounds to the original weight.

50% of 8 pounds is:
0.50 * 8 = 4 pounds

So, the new weight is:
8 + 4 = 12 pounds

However, this weight is too heavy for him, so he uses a weight that is 2 pounds lighter:
12 - 2 = 10 pounds

The weight that Jamaal now uses is:

"To determine how many games Steve has after 3 years, let's break down the information and calculate step by step.

1. **Initial Games:**
   - Steve starts with 5 games from his birthday.

2. **Games Purchased in the First Year:**
   - He buys 1 game per month for 12 months.
   - Total games bought in the first year: \(1 \times 12 = 12\)

3. **Games Purchased in the Second Year:**
   - He buys 2 games per month for 12 months.
   - Total games bought in the second year: \(2 \times 12 = 24\)

4. **Games Purchased in the Third Year:**
   - He buys 4 games per month for 12 months.
   - Total games bought in the third year: \(4 \times 12 = 48\)

5. **Games Received for Christmas:**
   - He gets 5 games each Christmas for 3 years.
   - Total games received for Christmas: \(5 \times 3 = 15\)

Now, let's add all these together to find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years:

\[5 \text{ (initial)} + 12 \text{ (first year)} + 24 \text{ (second year)} + 48 \text{ (third year)} + 15 \text{ (Christmas)} = 104\]

So, the total number of games Steve has after 3 years is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The speed of the plane can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Given that the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, the speed of the plane is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 additional hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Ruiz's production rate:**
   Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours. Therefore, his production rate is:
   \[
   \text{Ruiz's rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour}
   \]

2. **Determine Marissa's production rate:**
   Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, Marissa's production rate is:
   \[
   \text{Marissa's rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ pounds} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total production for 12 hours:**
   - Ruiz's total production in 12 hours:
     \[
     \text{Ruiz's total} = 60 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - Marissa's total production in 12 hours:
     \[
     \text{Marissa's total} = 90 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Calculate the combined total production:**
   \[
   \text{Total production} = \text{Ruiz's total} + \text{Marissa's total} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 1080 \text{ pounds} = 1800 \text{ pounds}

"To find out how much money Howard has left after spending at the arcade, we need to calculate his total spending over the three days and subtract it from his original amount of $100.

1. On Monday, Howard spends $8.
2. On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as on Monday, which is 2 * $8 = $16.
3. On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as on Tuesday, which is 4 * $16 = $64.

Now, let's add up his total spending:
$8 (Monday) + $16 (Tuesday) + $64 (Wednesday) = $88.

Subtracting this total from his original amount:
$100 - $88 = $12.

So, Howard has $12 left.

"To calculate the total earnings, we need to break down the sales into two parts and then sum the earnings from each part.

1. For the first four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. The earnings for this period are calculated as follows:
   - Number of cups sold in four hours: 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups
   - Earnings from these sales: 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30.00

2. For the next two hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup. The earnings for this period are calculated as follows:
   - Number of cups sold in two hours: 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups
   - Earnings from these sales: 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12.00

Now, we add the earnings from both periods to find the total earnings:
- Total earnings: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

Therefore, Patrick earned a total of $42.00 from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations the tires will undergo based on Jeremy's monthly driving distance and then determine how many months (and subsequently years) it will take to reach the tire's maximum rotation capacity.

1. First, we find out how many rotations the tires undergo in 400 miles:
   - Every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
   - For 400 miles, the number of rotations is \( 400 \div 2 \times 725 = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \) rotations per month.

2. Next, we determine how many months it will take to reach the tire's maximum rotation capacity of 10,440,000 rotations:
   - \( 10,440,000 \div 145,000 = 72 \) months.

3. Finally, we convert the number of months into years:
   - \( 72 \div 12 = 6 \) years.

Therefore, the tire will need to be replaced in 6 years.

"To find out how much each pump of shampoo costs, we first need to determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from the bottle if she uses 1 pump per wash. Since the bottle provides 120 washes with 2 pumps per wash, doubling the number of washes by using 1 pump per wash gives us:

120 washes * 2 = 240 washes

Now, we need to find the cost per wash. The jumbo bottle costs $24.00, so we divide the total cost by the number of washes to find the cost per wash:

$24.00 / 240 washes = $0.10 per wash

Since each wash now uses 1 pump, the cost per pump is the same as the cost per wash. To convert dollars to cents, we multiply by 100:

$0.10 * 100 = 10 cents

So, each pump costs 10 cents.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35, so the total cost is:

\[ 25 + 35 = 60 \]

Next, we apply the 30% discount to the total cost. A 30% discount means Joe pays 70% of the total cost. So, we calculate 70% of $60:

\[ 60 \times 0.70 = 42 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After spending $42 on the outfit, the amount of money he will have left is:

\[ 50 - 42 = 8 \]

"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of butter needed for 4 dozen croissants:
   - 1 dozen croissants require 1/4 pound of butter.
   - 4 dozen croissants will require 4 times that amount: \(4 \times \frac{1}{4} = 1\) pound of butter per day.

2. Calculate the total amount of butter needed for a week (7 days):
   - If 1 pound of butter is needed per day, then for 7 days, the total amount of butter required is \(1 \times 7 = 7\) pounds.

Therefore, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the costs into two parts: the initial 5 months and the additional months.

1. **Initial 5 months:**
   - Funding: $100,000

2. **Additional months:**
   - Total research time: 10 times the initial 5 months = 50 months
   - Additional months: 50 months - 5 months = 45 months
   - Monthly funding for additional months: 50% more than the initial monthly funding
   - Initial monthly funding: $100,000 / 5 months = $20,000 per month
   - Additional monthly funding: $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000 per month
   - Total funding for additional months: 45 months * $30,000 = $1,350,000

3. **Total cost:**
   - Initial 5 months: $100,000
   - Additional 45 months: $1,350,000
   - Total cost: $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000

"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to add up the ounces of meat eaten by each player who ordered meat.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, that's 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these amounts together:

6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

Therefore, the team consumed a total of 30 ounces of meat.

"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total sales amount for the 10 cars.
2. Determine the cost to the company for acquiring the cars.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the acquisition cost from the total sales.
4. Calculate James's commission based on the profit.

Let's go through each step:

1. **Total Sales Amount:**
   - James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
   - Total sales = 10 * $25,000 = $250,000

2. **Acquisition Cost:**
   - The company paid 30% of the car's price to acquire each car.
   - Acquisition cost per car = 30% of $25,000 = 0.30 * $25,000 = $7,500
   - Total acquisition cost for 10 cars = 10 * $7,500 = $75,000

3. **Profit:**
   - Profit = Total sales - Total acquisition cost
   - Profit = $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000

4. **James's Commission:**
   - James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
   - Commission = 10% of $175,000 = 0.10 * $175,000 = $17,500

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob. The key is to find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob.

Tom's speed is 70 miles per hour, and Bob's speed is 55 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:

70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. To find out how long it will take Tom to close a 75-mile gap, we divide the distance by the relative speed:

75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to follow the information given step by step.

1. Naomi caught 17 fish.
2. Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, so Darren caught \(17 - 6 = 11\) fish.
3. Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so Tommy caught \(11 + 3 = 14\) fish.

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class and see how many absences would push the cost per attended class over $10.

1. The total cost for the classes is $60.
2. There are 10 total classes.
3. The cost per class if he attends all is $60 / 10 = $6 per class.

If Manny misses some classes, the cost per attended class will increase. We need to find the maximum number of classes he can miss such that the cost per attended class does not exceed $10.

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny misses. Then, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

The cost per attended class is then \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \).

We set up the inequality to find the maximum \( x \) such that the cost per attended class is at most $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per attended class exceeds $10.

"To find the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we first need to determine how many customers Julie can process daily, and then calculate the total for both of them over a week.

1. Jewel processes 50 customers daily.
2. Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel, so Julie processes 50 * 2 = 100 customers daily.
3. Together, they process 50 (Jewel) + 100 (Julie) = 150 customers daily.
4. Since they work all days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 customers/day * 7 days/week = 1050 customers/week.

"To find out how many miles Lynn ran, let's break down the information given:

1. Paisley ran 4 miles.
2. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, which is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) miles.
3. Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. If we let \(L\) represent the number of miles Lynn ran, then Reggie's distance can be expressed as \(L + 3\).

Since we know Reggie ran 20 miles, we can set up the equation:
\[ L + 3 = 20 \]

Now, solve for \(L\):
\[ L = 20 - 3 \]
\[ L = 17 \]

So, Lynn ran 17 miles.

"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

The cost of one apple is:
$5.20 / 4 apples = $1.30 per apple

The cost of one orange is:
$3.30 / 3 oranges = $1.10 per orange

Now, we can calculate the cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
Cost of 5 apples = 5 * $1.30 = $6.50
Cost of 5 oranges = 5 * $1.10 = $5.50

Total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
$6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole he plans to dig. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular hole can be calculated using the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it will take Bob to shovel 72 cubic feet of earth. We know that it takes him 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) in seconds can be calculated as:

\[ T = 72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

So, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price of the truck to the cost of all the additional features he has chosen.

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, which is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500
6. Towing package: The cost of the towing package is not specified, so we will assume it is included in the ""several added features"" without a specific cost mentioned, and thus we will not add an additional cost for it.

Now, let's add up all the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500.

"To find out how much flour was in three bags in total before it was divided into portions, we first need to determine how much flour was in one bag. Since one bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we can calculate the total amount of flour in one bag by multiplying the number of portions by the weight of each portion:

1 bag = 8 portions * 2 kilograms/portion = 16 kilograms

Now, to find out how much flour was in three bags, we multiply the amount of flour in one bag by 3:

3 bags = 3 * 16 kilograms = 48 kilograms

So, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is 48 kilograms.

"To find out how many miles Alisa and Stanley biked in total, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add those distances together.

First, we calculate the distance Alisa biked. The formula to calculate distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Alisa:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} = 12 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4.5 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} = 54 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Stanley biked:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2.5 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 25 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we add the distances together to find the total distance:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} + \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 54 \, \text{miles} + 25 \, \text{miles} \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 79 \, \text{miles} \]

"To determine how long it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through both the soil and the clay.

First, we calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill can dig 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig through 24 feet of soil.
- Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet per hour = 6 hours.

Next, we calculate the time to dig through the clay:
- Bill can dig at half the speed through clay, which is 4 feet per hour / 2 = 2 feet per hour.
- He needs to dig through 8 feet of clay.
- Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet per hour = 4 hours.

Finally, we add the time to dig through the soil and the clay to get the total time:
- Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - We know that the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats were \( 2 \times 400 = 800 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first month:**
   - Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total sales in the first month = \( 400 + 800 = 1200 \) dollars.

3. **Determine the sales for the second month:**
   - In the second month, her sales were \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total sales of the first month.
   - Sales in the second month = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total sales for two months:**
   - Total sales for two months = Sales in the first month + Sales in the second month

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, and geese have 2 legs and 1 head. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The total number of animal heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

We can write these as two equations:

1. \( S + G = 20 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (total number of legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:

\( 2S + G = 35 \)

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To solve for \( S \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:

\( (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \)

This simplifies to:

\( S = 15 \)

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"To find out how many tablespoons of dry ingredients Svetlana needs to make 16 muffins, we need to calculate the total amount of flour, sugar, and salt required for 16 muffins and then sum these amounts.

For 1 muffin, the dry ingredients required are:
- Flour: 5 tablespoons
- Sugar: 3 tablespoons
- Salt: 0.25 tablespoons

For 16 muffins, the dry ingredients required are:
- Flour: 5 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 80 tablespoons
- Sugar: 3 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 48 tablespoons
- Salt: 0.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 4 tablespoons

Now, we add the amounts of flour, sugar, and salt to find the total:
80 tablespoons (flour) + 48 tablespoons (sugar) + 4 tablespoons (salt) = 132 tablespoons

Therefore, Svetlana would need 132 tablespoons of dry ingredients to make 16 muffins.

"To find out how much candy each of them would have if they shared equally, we first need to calculate the total amount of candy they have together. We do this by adding the amounts of candy that Robert, Cindy, and Aaron each have:

Robert's candy: 3 pounds
Cindy's candy: 5 pounds
Aaron's candy: 4 pounds

Total candy = 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds

Now, we divide the total amount of candy by the number of people to find out how much each person gets:

Number of people = 3

Candy per person = Total candy / Number of people
Candy per person = 12 pounds / 3
Candy per person = 4 pounds

So, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Christina has a 30-day month.
2. She had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral.
3. The first 8 days were good, the next 8 days were bad, and the last 8 days were neutral.
4. This means the 25th, 26th, and 27th days are the first three days of the last 8-day neutral period.
5. The next three days (28th, 29th, and 30th) are described as good, neutral, and good.

Now, let's count the good days:
- The first 8 days were all good.
- The 28th and 30th days are also good.

So, the total number of good days is:
8 (from the first 8 days) + 2 (from the 28th and 30th days) = 10 good days.

Since the month has 30 days and we are asked how many good days were left in the month, we need to consider the days that have already passed and the good days that are yet to come. The 28th and 30th days are the only good days left in the month.

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 2.

"To find out how many books Sally has, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ \text{Janey's books} = 2 \times S + 3 \]

We are also told that Janey has 21 books. So we can substitute 21 for Janey's books in the equation:
\[ 21 = 2 \times S + 3 \]

Now, we solve for \( S \):
\[ 21 - 3 = 2 \times S \]
\[ 18 = 2 \times S \]
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to first convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the growth rate is given in inches per day, we will convert the initial height from feet to inches.

1 foot = 12 inches

So, 20 feet = 20 * 12 inches = 240 inches

The bamboo grows 30 inches per day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches.

The total growth needed is:
600 inches (final height) - 240 inches (initial height) = 360 inches

Now, we divide the total growth needed by the daily growth rate to find the number of days:
360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so he needs 8 more toys, bringing the total to 12 toys for 12 dogs.
3. After buying the toys, he finds that there are twice as many dogs as when he left. Initially, there were 12 dogs, so now there are 24 dogs.
4. He needs to buy 12 more toys to have enough for the 24 dogs, making the total 24 toys.
5. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs 3 toys. Therefore, he now needs 21 toys in total.

"To determine how much money Skyler invested, we need to follow the steps of the investments made by Dylan and Frances, and then calculate the remaining amount for Skyler.

1. **Dylan's Investment:**
   - Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount.
   - Total amount = $1200
   - Dylan's investment = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = 480 \)

2. **Remaining Amount After Dylan's Investment:**
   - Remaining amount = Total amount - Dylan's investment
   - Remaining amount = 1200 - 480 = 720

3. **Frances's Investment:**
   - Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount.
   - Frances's investment = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = 480 \)

4. **Remaining Amount After Frances's Investment:**
   - Remaining amount = Remaining amount after Dylan's investment - Frances's investment
   - Remaining amount = 720 - 480 = 240

5. **Skyler's Investment:**
   - Skyler's investment is the remaining amount after Dylan's and Frances's investments.
   - Skyler's investment = 240

Therefore, Skyler's investment is $240.

"To determine by how much the group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we first need to calculate the total weight of the group and then compare it to the maximum load capacity.

1. Calculate the total weight of the 8 other adults:
   \( 8 \text{ adults} \times 80 \text{ kg/adult} = 640 \text{ kg} \)

2. Add Jack's weight to the total weight of the 8 adults. Assuming Jack is also an adult and weighs 80 kg:
   \( 640 \text{ kg} + 80 \text{ kg} = 720 \text{ kg} \)

3. Subtract the maximum load capacity of the elevator from the total weight of the group to find the excess weight:
   \( 720 \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg} \)

The group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

"To find the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length of the dress as \( L \) in centimeters.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the extension is \( 0.5L \). Additionally, she adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom of the dress. Therefore, the final length of the dress is the sum of the original length, the 50% extension, and the 20 cm lace trim:

\[ L + 0.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

To isolate \( L \), subtract 20 from both sides:

\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} \]

\[ L = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time Chris spent mowing each half of his lawn in the different modes and then sum these times.

1. **Turtle Mode:**
   - In turtle mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes).
   - Therefore, to mow half the lawn, he would take half of 60 minutes, which is 30 minutes.

2. **Rabbit Mode:**
   - In rabbit mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes.
   - Therefore, to mow half the lawn, he would take half of 40 minutes, which is 20 minutes.

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to mow the lawn is the sum of the time spent in turtle mode and the time spent in rabbit mode.
   - Total time = 30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( R \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write:

\[ T = R + 7 \]

The combined ages of the twins and the triplets are 44. Since there are two twins and three triplets, we can write the equation for their combined ages as:

\[ 2T + 3R = 44 \]

Now, we can substitute \( T \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now that we know \( R \), we can find \( T \):

\[ T = R + 7 \]
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of each candy. We know the total cost of five lollipops and four candies is $3.20. We also know that each lollipop costs $0.40.

First, calculate the total cost of the lollipops:
5 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $2.00

Now, subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the candies:
$3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20

This $1.20 is the total cost for four candies. To find the cost of one candy, divide the total cost of the candies by the number of candies:
$1.20 / 4 candies = $0.30 per candy

Now that we know the cost of one candy, we can calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:
10 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $4.00
10 candies * $0.30 per candy = $3.00

Add the cost of the lollipops and the candies to get the total cost:
$4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00

Therefore, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost Manolo $7.00.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many coins Neil saves each month and then calculate the total savings for both Rong and Neil over ten years.

1. Rong saves 20 coins every month.
2. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. This means Neil saves 20 coins + (2/5 * 20 coins) each month.

Let's calculate how many coins Neil saves each month:
\[ \text{Neil's monthly savings} = 20 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \right) \]
\[ \text{Neil's monthly savings} = 20 + 8 \]
\[ \text{Neil's monthly savings} = 28 \]

Now, we calculate the total savings for both Rong and Neil over ten years (120 months):
\[ \text{Rong's total savings} = 20 \times 120 \]
\[ \text{Rong's total savings} = 2400 \]

\[ \text{Neil's total savings} = 28 \times 120 \]
\[ \text{Neil's total savings} = 3360 \]

Finally, we add Rong's and Neil's total savings to find the combined total:

1. **Calculate the cost of the vaccines:**
   - John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20.
   - Total cost for vaccines = 2 * $20 = $40.

2. **Determine the total bill:**
   - Let the total bill be \( T \).
   - The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so the cost of the heartworm check is \( 0.60T \).

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check.
   - Therefore, \( T = 40 + 0.60T \).

4. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - \( T - 0.60T = 40 \)
   - \( 0.40T = 40 \)
   - \( T = \frac{40}{0.40} \)
   - \( T = 100 \)

There are 8 males, including Larry, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:
8 males * 4 dumplings/male = 32 dumplings

The total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings eaten by the males and the females:
18 dumplings (females) + 32 dumplings (males) = 50 dumplings

Therefore, Larry cooked 50 dumplings.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much money Gerald and Julia each received from the $100, based on the ratio 3:2.

The total parts of the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Each part is therefore worth \( \frac{100}{5} = 20 \) dollars.

Gerald's share, being 3 parts, is \( 3 \times 20 = 60 \) dollars.

If Gerald spent $10 on a book, the amount of money he has left is \( 60 - 10 = 50 \) dollars.

"To find out how many feet Martha's turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we first need to determine the speed of the turtle. We know that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and that the cat can run at a speed of 15 feet per second.

Let's denote the speed of the turtle as \( S \) (in feet per second). Since the cat is 5 times faster, we can write the relationship as:
\[ 15 \text{ feet/second} = 5 \times S \]

To find \( S \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ S = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} \]
\[ S = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now that we know the turtle's speed is 3 feet per second, we can calculate how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which the firefighters are raising money. We know that after 3 hours, they have raised $2100. 

The rate of money raised per hour is:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{\text{Total amount raised}}{\text{Number of hours}} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours in total they need to fundraise to reach their goal of $6300. We can use the formula:
\[ \text{Total hours needed} = \frac{\text{Total goal}}{\text{Rate}} = \frac{6300}{700} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Since they have already fundraised for 3 hours, the additional hours needed are:
\[ \text{Additional hours needed} = 9 - 3 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

However, the question asks for the total hours they have to fundraise to reach their goal, which is 9 hours.

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's water used by the city for all purposes, which is given as 40%.
2. Calculate the percentage of the city's water use that is for industrial purposes, which is 80% of the 40%.
3. Subtract the industrial water use from the total city water use to find the non-industrial water use.

Let's do the calculations:

- Industrial water use: 80% of 40% = 0.80 * 40% = 32%
- Non-industrial water use: 40% (total city use) - 32% (industrial use) = 8%

So, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

"To find Marcus' total bill, we first need to calculate the cost of each type of item he ordered, then sum these costs, and finally apply the 10% discount.

1. Cost of croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00 each = $15.00
2. Cost of cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50 each = $10.00
3. Cost of mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00 each = $12.00
4. Cost of blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins * $1.00 each = $13.00

Now, we add up these amounts to get the total before the discount:
Total before discount = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Next, we apply the 10% discount:
Discount amount = 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total before discount to get the final total:
Total bill = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can buy with $6.00 under the deal ""buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free,"" we need to calculate the cost and the number of scoops she can get for her money.

Each scoop costs $1.50. For every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. Therefore, for every 3 scoops, she only pays for 2.

The cost for 2 scoops is:
2 scoops * $1.50/scoop = $3.00

Since she gets 1 scoop free with every 2 scoops purchased, for $3.00, she gets 3 scoops.

With $6.00, she can buy:
$6.00 / $3.00 = 2 sets of 3 scoops

So, for $6.00, she can get:
2 sets * 3 scoops/set = 6 scoops

Therefore, Erin can buy 6 scoops of ice cream with her $6.00.

2. **Medium cubes**: Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water. Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   - Water used for medium cubes = 7 cubes * 2 ounces/cube = 14 ounces

3. **Small cubes**: Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water. Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   - Water used for small cubes = 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces/cube = 4 ounces

Next, we add up the total water used for all the cubes:
- Total water used = 12 ounces (giant) + 14 ounces (medium) + 4 ounces (small) = 30 ounces

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water:
- Water left = 32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many books each person has based on the information provided.

1. Clara has 20 books.
2. Clara has two times as many books as Steven. Therefore, if we let \( S \) represent the number of books Steven has, then \( 2S = 20 \). Solving for \( S \), we get \( S = 10 \). So, Steven has 10 books.
3. Alice has 6 more books than Steven. Since Steven has 10 books, Alice has \( 10 + 6 = 16 \) books.

Now, we need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice. Clara has 20 books, and Alice has 16 books. The difference is \( 20 - 16 = 4 \).

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. We know that a gallon jar costs $5 and that it is $2 more than a half-gallon jar. Therefore, the cost of a half-gallon jar is:

Cost of a half-gallon jar = Cost of a gallon jar - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $3

Now, we can calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

Total cost for gallon jars = Number of gallon jars * Cost of a gallon jar
Total cost for gallon jars = 10 * $5
Total cost for gallon jars = $50

Total cost for half-gallon jars = Number of half-gallon jars * Cost of a half-gallon jar
Total cost for half-gallon jars = 16 * $3
Total cost for half-gallon jars = $48

Total amount spent = Total cost for gallon jars + Total cost for half-gallon jars
Total amount spent = $50 + $48
Total amount spent = $98

2. **Number of students who like to bake**: 10
3. **Number of students who like to play basketball**: 5
4. **Number of students who like to play music**: This is twice the number who like to play basketball, so \(2 \times 5 = 10\).

Now, let's calculate the number of students who like to play video games:

- First, find the total number of students who have hobbies other than video games:
  \[
  10 \text{ (baking)} + 5 \text{ (basketball)} + 10 \text{ (music)} = 25
  \]

- Subtract this number from the total number of students to find the number who like to play video games:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of students in both classes**: 80 students.
2. **Number of students in each class**: Since the two classes have the same number of students, we divide the total number of students by 2:
   \[
   \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40
   \]

3. **Percentage of girls in each class**: 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we calculate 40% of 40:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls in each class} = 0.40 \times 40 = 16
   \]

4. **Number of boys in each class**: Since the total number of students in each class is 40, and 16 of them are girls, the number of boys in each class is:
   \[
   \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24

"To solve this problem, let's break down the transactions step by step.

1. **Initial Inventory:**
   - Small stickers: 30
   - Large stickers: 40

2. **Trading 90% of small stickers for large buttons:**
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 27 small buttons = 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons

3. **Remaining small stickers:**
   - 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers

4. **Trading 50% of large stickers for large buttons:**
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons

5. **Remaining large stickers:**
   - 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers

6. **Trading the remaining large stickers for small buttons:**
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons

7. **Total buttons:**
   - Large buttons: 9 (from small stickers) + 20 (from large stickers) = 29 large buttons
   - Small buttons: 3 (remaining small stickers) + 60 (from large stickers) = 63 small buttons

"To determine how many cases of shingles the third house will need, we can set up the problem with the following information:

- Let \( x \) be the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house.
- The second house needs twice as many cases as the first house, so it will need \( 2x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the amount of the first house, so it will need \( 2x \) cases.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

Since the third house needs \( 2x \) cases, we calculate:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

20% of $1000 is calculated as:
0.20 * $1000 = $200

Subtract the discount from the original price:
$1000 - $200 = $800

So, after a 20% discount, you have to pay $800 for the laptop.

"To calculate the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection with digital versions, we need to break down the costs based on the different categories of movies he has.

1. **Movies in Series:**
   - A third of the 600 movies are in series.
   - Number of movies in series: \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \)
   - Cost of these movies: Since he can get these for $6 each, the total cost for the series movies is \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \) dollars.

2. **Remaining Movies:**
   - Total movies: 600
   - Movies in series: 200
   - Remaining movies: \( 600 - 200 = 400 \)

3. **Older Movies:**
   - 40% of the remaining 400 movies are older movies.
   - Number of older movies: \( 400 \times 0.40 = 160 \)
   - Cost of older movies: Since older movies cost $5 each, the total cost for older movies is \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars.

4. **Normal Movies:**
   - Remaining movies after accounting for older movies: \( 400 - 160 = 240 \)
   - Cost of normal movies: Since normal movies cost $10 each, the total cost for normal movies is \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \) dollars.

5. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost for series movies: $1200
   - Total cost for older movies: $800
   - Total cost for normal movies: $2400
   - Total cost to replace the movies: \( 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \) dollars.

The total cost to replace the movies is:

"To find out how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit he picked and then add those costs together.

The cost of peaches is $2.00 per pound, and Winston picked 6 pounds, so the cost for peaches is:
6 pounds * $2.00/pound = $12.00

The cost of plums is $1.00 per pound, and Winston picked 8 pounds, so the cost for plums is:
8 pounds * $1.00/pound = $8.00

The cost of apricots is $3.00 per pound, and Winston picked 6 pounds, so the cost for apricots is:
6 pounds * $3.00/pound = $18.00

Now, we add the costs of all the fruits together to find the total amount spent:
$12.00 (peaches) + $8.00 (plums) + $18.00 (apricots) = $38.00

Therefore, Winston spent $38.00 on fruit.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the Llesis family traveled, which is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked.

First, let's calculate the distance they drove:
- They drove for 6 hours in total, but since they hiked for 1.5 hours, they drove for \(6 - 1.5 = 4.5\) hours.
- They drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.
- The distance they drove is \(4.5 \times 50 = 225\) miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance they hiked:
- They hiked at an average speed of \(50 \times 0.5 - 5 = 25 - 5 = 20\) miles per hour.
- They hiked for 1.5 hours.
- The distance they hiked is \(1.5 \times 20 = 30\) miles.

Finally, the total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked:

"To determine the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores, we need to calculate the points they each earn from jumping on enemies, collecting berries, and the time left on the timer, and then find the difference.

Let's denote:
- \( E \) as the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- \( B \) as the number of berries Emma collects.
- \( T \) as the number of seconds left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.

Ava's points:
- Enemies: \( (E + 8) \times 10 \)
- Berries: \( (B + 3) \times 5 \)
- Timer: \( (T - 4) \times 30 \)

Emma's points:
- Enemies: \( E \times 10 \)
- Berries: \( B \times 5 \)
- Timer: \( T \times 30 \)

Now, let's calculate the total points for each:

Ava's total score:
\[ 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T - 4) \]
\[ = 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120 \]
\[ = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25 \]

Emma's total score:
\[ 10E + 5B + 30T \]

The difference between their scores:
\[ (10E + 5B + 30T - 25) - (10E + 5B + 30T) \]
\[ = -25 \]

The difference between their two scores is:

"To find out how much each of the other two pizzas cost, we can start by subtracting the total cost of the two pizzas that we know the price of from the total cost of all four pizzas.

The total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars. Two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars in total. So, the cost of the remaining two pizzas is:

64 dollars - 30 dollars = 34 dollars

Since the remaining two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of the remaining pizzas by 2 to find the cost of each:

34 dollars / 2 = 17 dollars

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars.

"To find out how many times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of rides on the 5 days when they ride thrice a day, and the number of rides on the 2 days when they ride twice as much as on the usual days.

For the 5 days:
- They ride 3 times a day.
- So, for 5 days, the total number of rides is 5 days * 3 rides/day = 15 rides.

For the 2 special days:
- They ride twice the usual amount, which is 2 * 3 rides/day = 6 rides/day.
- So, for 2 days, the total number of rides is 2 days * 6 rides/day = 12 rides.

Adding the rides from the 5 days and the 2 special days together:
- Total rides in a week = 15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Initially, Bob had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.
2. He bought 17 more fish from the pet store, which included both orange and white fish.
3. After adding these 17 fish to his pond, he found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of white fish Bob bought.
- \( y \) as the number of orange fish Bob bought.

From the problem, we know:
- \( x + y = 17 \) (since he bought 17 fish in total).

After adding the new fish to his pond:
- The total number of white fish is \( 4 + x \).
- The total number of orange fish is \( 3 + y \).

According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish:
\[ 3 + y = 2(4 + x) \]

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

First, expand the equation:
\[ 3 + y = 8 + 2x \]

Rearrange to isolate \( y \):
\[ y = 8 + 2x - 3 \]
\[ y = 5 + 2x \]

Now, substitute \( y = 5 + 2x \) into the first equation \( x + y = 17 \):
\[ x + (5 + 2x) = 17 \]
\[ x + 5 + 2x = 17 \]
\[ 3x + 5 = 17 \]
\[ 3x = 12 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

To verify, if \( x = 4 \), then:
\[ y = 5 + 2(4) \]
\[ y = 5 + 8 \]
\[ y = 13 \]

So, Bob bought 13 orange fish.

Now, let's check the total number of fish:
- Total white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \)
- Total orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \)

Indeed, 16 is twice 8, which confirms our solution is correct.

The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:

"To determine how much money Andy's car is consuming per week for his commute, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Andy drives to work each week.
2. Determine the total amount of fuel used each week.
3. Calculate the total cost of the fuel used each week.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance driven each week.**

Andy drives to work and back home each day, which is a round trip of:
\[ 5 \text{ miles (one way)} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles per day} \]

Since he drives to work from Monday to Friday, the total distance driven each week is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ miles/week} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of fuel used each week.**

Andy's car has a fuel efficiency of 10 miles per gallon (MPG). Therefore, the total amount of fuel used each week is:
\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles/week}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons/week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the fuel used each week.**

The price of gas is $3 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost of the fuel used each week is:
\[ 5 \text{ gallons/week} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the total amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week for his commute is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carrie spent on lunch, which includes all the quarters and 3/5 of the twenties.

First, let's calculate the total value of the quarters:
- Each quarter is worth $0.25.
- Carrie has 140 quarters.
- The total value of the quarters is 140 * $0.25 = $35.

Next, let's calculate the total value of the twenties:
- Each twenty is worth $20.
- Carrie has ten twenties.
- The total value of the twenties is 10 * $20 = $200.

Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties:
- 3/5 of $200 is (3/5) * $200 = $120.

Now, we add the value of the quarters and the amount spent from the twenties to find the total amount spent:
- Total amount spent = $35 (quarters) + $120 (twenties) = $155.

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is $155.

"To find out how many fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the total number of tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo has 5 tomato plants.
- So, the total number of tomatoes is 22 tomatoes/plant * 5 plants = 110 tomatoes.

Next, we calculate the total number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants.
- So, the total number of eggplants is 4 eggplants/plant * 8 plants = 32 eggplants.

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:
- Total fruits = 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits.

"To find out how many OLED TVs Samwell's store sold, we first need to determine the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, and then subtract these from the total number of TVs sold.

1. Calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
   - One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs, so \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \) smart TVs.

2. Calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
   - One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs, so \( \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \) analog TVs.

3. Calculate the number of OLED TVs sold:
   - The rest of the TVs sold are OLED TVs. To find this, subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold.
   - \( 40 - 10 - 5 = 25 \) OLED TVs.

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25.

"To determine how much money John is missing, we first need to calculate the total amount of money required for the trip after the school's contribution. Since the school is covering half the cost of the trip, we can calculate the school's contribution as follows:

School's contribution = 1/2 * Total cost of the trip
School's contribution = 1/2 * $300
School's contribution = $150

Now, we need to find out how much John needs to contribute, which is the remaining half of the trip cost:

John's required contribution = Total cost of the trip - School's contribution
John's required contribution = $300 - $150
John's required contribution = $150

John currently has $50, so the amount of money he is missing is:

Money missing = John's required contribution - Money John has
Money missing = $150 - $50
Money missing = $100

"To determine how many logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing, we first need to calculate the temperature during the night.

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees. It is 33 degrees colder during the night, so the temperature at night is:

45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, so Carson needs to raise the temperature from 12 degrees to at least 32 degrees. The difference in temperature that needs to be made up is:

32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we divide the total temperature increase needed by the temperature increase provided by one log:

20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs

Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of groups formed. Since 90 people were split into 9-person groups, we divide 90 by 9:

90 / 9 = 10 groups

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups had members bring back seashells. According to the problem, 3/5 of the groups each had members bring back 2 seashells each. So we calculate 3/5 of 10:

(3/5) * 10 = 6 groups

Now, we know that 6 groups had members bring back seashells. Since each member of these groups brought back 2 seashells, and each group has 9 members, we can calculate the total number of seashells brought back by these groups:

6 groups * 9 members/group * 2 seashells/member = 108 seashells

Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is:

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total monthly salary for all employees.
3. Multiply the total monthly salary by the number of months (3) to get the total amount paid over three months.

Step 1: Determine the total number of employees after three months.
- Initial number of employees: 200
- Number of new employees hired each month: 20
- Number of months: 3

Total number of new employees hired in three months = 20 employees/month * 3 months = 60 employees

Total number of employees after three months = Initial employees + New employees

"To find the school's overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and divide it by the total number of students.

First, let's find the pass rate for each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed, so the pass rate is 340/500.
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed, so the pass rate is 40/100.
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth-graders, so it is 2 * (40/100) = 80/100. Since there are 400 fifth-graders, the number who passed is 400 * (80/100) = 320.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students and the total number of students who passed:

- Total students: 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000 students.
- Total students who passed: 340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 320 (fifth-graders) = 700 students.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students:

Overall pass rate = 700 / 1000 = 0.7 or 70%.

2. Determine how many square inches of mosaic can be made with the total number of glass chips.
3. Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, calculate the length of the mosaic based on the total area that can be covered.

Step 1: Total number of glass chips
Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag holds 72 chips.
Total chips = 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips

Step 2: Total area of mosaic that can be made
It takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch of mosaic.
Total area = Total chips / 12 chips per square inch
Total area = 144 chips / 12 chips per square inch = 12 square inches

Step 3: Length of the mosaic
The mosaic is 3 inches tall, so to find the length, we divide the total area by the height.
Length = Total area / Height
Length = 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches

Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"To find out how many gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party, we first need to calculate the total amount of tea that was consumed and then add the 10 quarts that were left over.

First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the four students who each drank 1.5 quarts:
4 students * 1.5 quarts/student = 6 quarts

Next, we calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the 16 students who each drank 2 quarts:
16 students * 2 quarts/student = 32 quarts

Now, we add the tea consumed by both groups of students:
6 quarts + 32 quarts = 38 quarts

We then add the 10 quarts that were left over to find the total amount of tea that was at the beginning of the party:
38 quarts + 10 quarts = 48 quarts

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
48 quarts / 4 quarts/gallon = 12 gallons

Therefore, there were 12 gallons of tea at the beginning of the party.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of May and then subtract the initial number of students to find out how many additional students have joined.

The number of students doubles at the end of every month. Starting with 10 students at the beginning of the year, the number of students at the end of each month can be calculated as follows:

- End of January: \(10 \times 2 = 20\)
- End of February: \(20 \times 2 = 40\)
- End of March: \(40 \times 2 = 80\)
- End of April: \(80 \times 2 = 160\)
- End of May: \(160 \times 2 = 320\)

By the end of May, there are 320 students on campus. To find the number of additional students who have joined, we subtract the initial number of students (10) from the number of students at the end of May (320):

\(320 - 10 = 310\)

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed on average per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches climbed in the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in the week to find the average.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 per branch and he made $105 in a week. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches} = 420 \]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day.

"To find the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase, we need to calculate the number of petals on the flowers Rose picked and then subtract the petals from the flowers she dropped.

1. First, she picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
   \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals

2. Then, she picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
   \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals

3. Next, she adds 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
   \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals

4. Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
   \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any flowers are dropped:
\(15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\) petals

Since she drops 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract the petals from one of each type of flower:
- 1 flower with 5 petals: \(5\) petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals: \(6\) petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals: \(4\) petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals: \(7\) petals

Total petals from the dropped flowers:
\(5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\) petals

Subtracting the petals from the dropped flowers from the total gives:
\(101 - 22 = 79\) petals

Therefore, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:
79"
"John and DeSean together made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores, which means they used 18 marshmallows. They also dropped 3 marshmallows, so in total, 18 + 3 = 21 marshmallows were used or lost. The bag originally had 35 marshmallows, so the number of marshmallows left in the bag is 35 - 21 = 14 marshmallows. Since there are two kids, they can each have 14 / 2 = 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

"To determine how much money is used, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then convert that time into the number of quarters used.

1. **Jack's Play Time:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
   - They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.
   - Number of quarters Jack uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \)

2. **Two Friends (Worse Players):**
   - Each of these friends can play for 10 minutes per quarter (half as long as Jack).
   - Number of quarters each worse friend uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters} \)
   - Since there are two worse friends, total quarters used by both: \( 24 \text{ quarters} \times 2 = 48 \text{ quarters} \)

3. **One Friend (Better Player):**
   - This friend can play for 30 minutes per quarter (1.5 times as long as Jack).
   - Number of quarters the better friend uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \)

4. **Total Quarters Used:**
   - Jack: 12 quarters
   - Two worse friends: 48 quarters
   - One better friend: 8 quarters
   - Total quarters used: \( 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters} \)

5. **Total Money Used:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Total money used: \( 68 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 17 \text{ dollars} \)

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables for the amounts of each ingredient Tanya uses in ounces:

- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Let \( f \) be the amount of fragrance.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt.
- Let \( u \) be the amount of sugar.
- Let \( o \) be the amount of oil.

From the problem, we know the following relationships:
1. \( z = f \) (same amount of citrus zest as fragrance)
2. \( s = u \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
3. \( o = 2s \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( s = 2z \) (twice as much salt as zest)

We also know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces:
\[ z + f + s + u + o = 10 \]

Using the relationships, we can express all variables in terms of \( z \):
- \( f = z \)
- \( s = 2z \)
- \( u = 2z \)
- \( o = 2s = 2(2z) = 4z \)

Substituting these into the total mixture equation:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil:
\[ o = 4z = 4(1) = 4 \]

So, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Determine how many cars Joe has initially:
   - Robert has 20 cars.
   - Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - Therefore, Joe has \(20 \times 2 = 40\) cars.

2. Calculate how many cars Joe sells:
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - 20% of 40 cars is \(0.20 \times 40 = 8\) cars.

3. Determine how many cars Joe gives away:
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold.
   - He sold 8 cars, so he gives away \(2 \times 8 = 16\) cars.

4. Calculate the total number of cars Joe no longer has:
   - Joe sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars.
   - Total cars no longer with Joe: \(8 + 16 = 24\) cars.

5. Calculate how many cars Joe has left:
   - Joe initially had 40 cars.
   - He no longer has 24 cars.
   - Therefore, Joe has \(40 - 24 = 16\) cars left.

"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount raised by the students. The total amount raised for the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

Since there are 20 students, and they each earned the same amount, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

$125,000 / 20 = $6,250

So, each student raised $6,250.

"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk over the two days in minutes, we first need to determine the total time in hours and then convert that to minutes.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. On the second day, she walked for half as many hours as the first day, which is:

8 hours / 2 = 4 hours

The total time walked over the two days in hours is:

8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours

To convert the total time to minutes, we multiply the total hours by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes.

"To find out how much John makes in a full 7-day week, we need to calculate the total earnings based on the number of cycles, tasks per cycle, and the pay per task.

1. First, calculate the earnings per cycle:
   - Each cycle has 5 tasks.
   - Each task pays $1.20.
   - Earnings per cycle = 5 tasks * $1.20/task = $6.00.

2. Next, calculate the daily earnings:
   - John does 30 cycles a day.
   - Daily earnings = 30 cycles/day * $6.00/cycle = $180.00/day.

3. Finally, calculate the weekly earnings:
   - John works 7 days a week.
   - Weekly earnings = 7 days/week * $180.00/day = $1260.00/week.

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of cards each person has in terms of PJ's cards. Let's say PJ has \( x \) cards.

Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has \( 3x \) cards.

Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3x + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is the sum of the cards each person has, which is given as 341. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + 3x + 3x + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7x + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ 7x = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[ x = 47 \]

Now, we know PJ has 47 cards. To find out how many cards Becca has, we use the expression for Becca's cards:

\[ 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, Becca has 153 cards.

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book and the amount she will be refunded by Amazon.

1. Calculate the shipping cost:
   - The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
   - The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
   - The total shipping cost is (4 pounds * $0.35/pound) + (20 miles * $0.08/mile).

2. Calculate the refund amount:
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which is $32.
   - The refund amount is 75% of $32.

3. Calculate the net loss:
   - The net loss is the purchase price minus the refund amount plus the shipping cost.

Let's do the math:

1. Shipping cost:
   - Weight cost: 4 * $0.35 = $1.40
   - Distance cost: 20 * $0.08 = $1.60
   - Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

2. Refund amount:
   - 75% of $32 = 0.75 * $32 = $24.00

3. Net loss:
   - Purchase price: $32.00
   - Refund amount: $24.00
   - Shipping cost: $3.00
   - Net loss: $32.00 - $24.00 + $3.00 = $11.00

Milly will lose $11.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the height that each character can lift a mountain, starting from Pompei and working our way up to Naruto.

1. **Pompei's lifting height**: Given as 1 inch.
2. **Saskay's lifting height**: Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. So, Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches.
3. **Kagiyami's lifting height**: Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. So, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.
4. **Naruto's lifting height**: Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. So, Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches.

Now, we need to convert the height from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and then calculate the time it would take for the turtles to travel the same distance.

1. First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can assume that the total distance is the same for one kangaroo, as they are traveling at the same speed. Therefore, one kangaroo would also take 18 hours to travel the same distance.

2. Let's denote the speed of one kangaroo as \( S_k \) and the distance across the highway as \( D \). The relationship between speed, distance, and time is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
   \]
   So, for a kangaroo:
   \[
   S_k = \frac{D}{18 \text{ hours}}
   \]

3. The speed of a turtle is half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle \( S_t \) is:
   \[
   S_t = \frac{S_k}{2} = \frac{D}{36 \text{ hours}}
   \]

4. Now, we need to find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to travel the same distance \( D \). Since the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{D}{36 \text{ hours}} \), the speed of 4 turtles together (assuming they can travel in parallel and the distance is the same) is:
   \[
   4 \times S_t = 4 \times \frac{D}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{4D}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{D}{9 \text{ hours}}
   \]

5. The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is:
   \[
   T = \frac{D}{S_{4t}} = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{9 \text{ hours}}} = 9 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 9 hours to travel across the highway.

"To find out how many clay dishes Jada, Rory, and Kora make together, we can start by determining how many dishes each person makes based on the information given.

Kora made 20 dishes. According to the problem, Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora. So, we can calculate the number of dishes Rory made as follows:

Rory's dishes = Kora's dishes + 20
Rory's dishes = 20 + 20
Rory's dishes = 40

Next, we know that Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory. So, we can calculate the number of dishes Jada made as follows:

Jada's dishes = 2 * Rory's dishes
Jada's dishes = 2 * 40
Jada's dishes = 80

Now, to find the total number of dishes made by all three, we add the number of dishes each person made:

Total dishes = Kora's dishes + Rory's dishes + Jada's dishes
Total dishes = 20 + 40 + 80
Total dishes = 140

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes they all make together is 140.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after the trade-in, her part-time job pay, and her mom's contribution, and then subtract the amount she still needs to buy the laptop.

The cost of the new laptop after the trade-in is:
$600 - $200 = $400

Erika has received the following amounts:
- Part-time job pay: $150
- Contribution from her mom: $80

The total amount she has received from these sources is:
$150 + $80 = $230

Erika still needs $50 more to buy the laptop, which means the total amount she has, including the money in her purse, is:
$400 - $50 = $350

To find out how much money is in her purse, we subtract the amount she has received from other sources from the total amount she has:
$350 - $230 = $120

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first calculate the total amount of milk produced by the current cows and then find the difference needed to reach the target.

1. The farmer currently has 3 cows, each producing 5 liters of milk a day.
2. The total milk production from the 3 cows is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) liters a day.
3. The target milk production is 25 liters a day.
4. The additional milk needed to reach the target is \(25 - 15 = 10\) liters a day.
5. Since each cow produces 5 liters a day, the number of additional cows needed is \(10 \div 5 = 2\).

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we first need to calculate the remaining length of each glue stick and then sum these lengths.

1. The first glue stick has 1/6 left. The original length is 12 millimeters, so the remaining length is:
   \( 12 \times \frac{1}{6} = 2 \) millimeters.

2. The second glue stick has 2/3 left. The remaining length is:
   \( 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 8 \) millimeters.

3. The third glue stick has 1/2 left. The remaining length is:
   \( 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \) millimeters.

Now, we add the remaining lengths of all three glue sticks:
\( 2 + 8 + 6 = 16 \) millimeters.

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Craig starts with. He has 2 twenty dollar bills, so:

2 * $20 = $40

Next, we calculate the total cost of the six squirt guns. Each squirt gun costs $2, so:

6 * $2 = $12

Then, we calculate the total cost of the three packs of water balloons. Each pack costs $3, so:

3 * $3 = $9

Now, we add the cost of the squirt guns and the water balloons to find the total amount spent:

$12 + $9 = $21

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Craig had:

$40 - $21 = $19

So, the amount of money Craig has left is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack has 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack has 60 / 2 = 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 2 * 30 = 60 socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Total socks: Jack's socks + Peter's socks = 30 + 60 = 90 socks
- Total dishes: Jack's dishes + Peter's dishes = 60 + 30 = 90 dishes

Adding the total number of socks and dishes together:

90 socks + 90 dishes = 180 items

"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider both the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

We know that:
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

First, let's find out how many students are good at both subjects. Since there are 20 students in total, we can subtract the number of students who are good at math only and those who are good at English only from the total number of students:

20 (total students) - 5 (math only) - 8 (English only) = 7 students are good at both math and English.

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only to those who are good at both:

5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12 students are good at math.

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group will take, including their setup, performance, and exit, and then subtract the intermission time from the total concert time.

Each group's total time on stage is:
2 minutes (setup) + 6 minutes (performance) + 2 minutes (exit) = 10 minutes per group.

The concert is 2 hours long, which is:
2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.

Subtracting the 10-minute intermission from the total concert time gives us:
120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes available for performances.

Now, we divide the available time by the time each group takes:
110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups.

So, Vicki can have 11 groups perform in the concert.

"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest earned and then add it to the original investment.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Principal (P) = $300
- Rate (R) = three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year, or 75% of the principal.
- Time (T) = 3 years

First, convert the rate to a decimal:
\[ \text{Rate} = 0.75 \]

Now, calculate the simple interest:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3 = 675 \]

Next, add the simple interest to the original principal to find the total amount:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
975"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **White Shirts with Collars**: Since half of the 40 white shirts have collars, the number of white shirts with collars is:
   \[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

2. **White Shirts with No Collars**: The remaining white shirts do not have collars, so the number of white shirts with no collars is:
   \[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

3. **Floral Shirts with Buttons**: We are given that 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.

4. **Floral Shirts with No Buttons**: The total number of floral shirts is 50, so the number of floral shirts with no buttons is:
   \[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

5. **Difference in Quantity**: To find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are compared to white shirts with no collars, we subtract the number of white shirts with no collars from the number of floral shirts with no buttons:
   \[ 30 - 20 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

"To find out how many goats are left in both farms altogether, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm after the sales and then add those numbers together.

Starting with Farm X:
- Mr. Smith originally has 55 goats.
- He sold 10 goats.
- Therefore, the number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45 goats.

For Farm Y:
- Mr. Smith originally has 45 goats.
- He sold twice as many goats as he did from Farm X, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats.
- Therefore, the number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25 goats.

Adding the goats left in both farms:
- Goats left in Farm X + Goats left in Farm Y = 45 + 25 = 70 goats.

So, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is 70.

"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent on shoes by the total number of pairs of shoes to find the average cost per pair.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, so in a year (which has 12 months), he buys:
2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

He spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount spent by the number of pairs:
$2640 / 24 pairs = $110 per pair

So, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is $110.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food:
   - Each basket of green food costs $25.
   - Therefore, 3 baskets of green food cost \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

2. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount:
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - You get $2 off for each basket of red food, so each basket of red food effectively costs \( 18 - 2 = 16 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, 3 baskets of red food cost \( 3 \times 16 = 48 \) dollars.

3. Add the costs of the green and red food baskets to find the total cost:
   - Total cost = Cost of green food + Cost of red food
   - Total cost = \( 75 + 48 = 123 \) dollars.

So, the total amount you will have to pay is:

"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we can break down the problem year by year:

1. In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they will build three times as many homes as in the first year. This means they will build \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
3. In the third year, they will count the total number of homes built in the first two years and then double that amount. The total number of homes built in the first two years is \(12 + 36 = 48\). Doubling this amount gives \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Now, we add the number of homes built each year to find the total:

- First year: 12 homes
- Second year: 36 homes
- Third year: 96 homes

Total homes built over the three years: \(12 + 36 + 96 = 144\).

"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- My age: \( x \)
- My brother's age: \( x + 3 \) (since I am three years younger than my brother)
- My sister's age: \( x - 2 \) (since I am two years older than my sister)
- My mom's age: \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \) (since my mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age)

According to the problem, the sum of all our ages is 87. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + [3(x + 3) - 1] = 87 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 6x = 78 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ x = 13 \]

So, I am 13 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people infected each day, starting with the initial ten people infected on day 0.

- **Day 0**: 10 people are initially infected.
- **Day 1**: Each of the 10 people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is 10 * 6 = 60. The total number of infected people is now 10 (initial) + 60 (new) = 70.
- **Day 2**: Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is 70 * 6 = 420. The total number of infected people is now 70 (from Day 1) + 420 (new) = 490.
- **Day 3**: Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is 490 * 6 = 2940. The total number of infected people is now 490 (from Day 2) + 2940 (new) = 3430.

Therefore, after three days, the total number of people infected is 3430.

"To determine how much money Isaias spent on the chickens he took to the market, we first need to calculate how many chickens he plans to sell and then use the profit information to find the cost.

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell:
   - Isaias has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them.
   - Number of chickens to sell = 300 * (3/5) = 180 chickens.

2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the chickens:
   - Selling price per chicken = $50.
   - Total revenue = 180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000.

3. Determine the cost of the chickens:
   - Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000.
   - Profit = Total revenue - Cost.
   - $2000 = $9000 - Cost.
   - Cost = $9000 - $2000 = $7000.

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for $7000.

"To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we first need to determine how many glasses each of the boys sold. Since Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold a total of 32 glasses and Julie sold 14 glasses, we can subtract Julie's sales from the total to find out how many glasses the boys sold together:

32 glasses (total) - 14 glasses (Julie's sales) = 18 glasses (boys' sales combined)

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the boys' sales by 2 to find out how many each boy sold:

18 glasses (boys' sales combined) / 2 = 9 glasses (each boy's sales)

Now we can find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah by subtracting Micah's sales from Julie's sales:

14 glasses (Julie's sales) - 9 glasses (Micah's sales) = 5 glasses

So, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"To find out how much money Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and then sum them up.

1. The cost of doing her hair is $400.
2. The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the cost of doing her hair, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \) dollars.
3. The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the cost of the manicure, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \) dollars.

Now, we add up the costs of all the services:
- Hair: $400
- Manicure: $100
- Pedicure: $75

Total spent: \( 400 + 100 + 75 = 575 \) dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling her rope.
2. Determine the length of the new rope she can buy with the money from the sale.
3. Calculate the cost of the new rope.
4. Subtract the cost of the new rope from the total money received from the sale to find out how much money she will have left over.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money from selling the rope.
Sarah's rope is 20 meters long, and she sells it for $2 per meter.
Total money from sale = 20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Step 2: Determine the length of the new rope she can buy.
The new rope costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of new rope she can buy, we divide the total money from the sale by the cost per meter of the new rope.
Length of new rope = Total money from sale / Cost per meter of new rope
Length of new rope = $40 / $1.5/meter = 26.67 meters (approximately)

Since Sarah cannot buy a fraction of a meter, we will assume she buys 26 meters of the new rope.

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the new rope.
Cost of new rope = Length of new rope * Cost per meter of new rope
Cost of new rope = 26 meters * $1.5/meter = $39

Step 4: Calculate the leftover money.
Money left over = Total money from sale - Cost of new rope
Money left over = $40 - $39 = $1

So, Sarah will have $1 left over after she buys the new rope.

"To solve this problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age. If in 10 years Melanie will be 18 years old, we can set up the following equation to find her current age:

\[ \text{Current age} + 10 = 18 \]

Solving for her current age:

\[ \text{Current age} = 18 - 10 \]
\[ \text{Current age} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when her age will be three times her current age. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we first need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart.

1. **Cost of bacon:**
   - 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total.

2. **Cost of chicken:**
   - Each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Cost of one pack of bacon = $10 / 5 = $2.
   - Cost of one pack of chicken = $2 * 2 = $4.
   - Total cost for 6 packs of chicken = 6 * $4 = $24.

3. **Cost of strawberries:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Total cost for 3 packs of strawberries = 3 * $4 = $12.

4. **Cost of apples:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Cost of one pack of apples = $4 / 2 = $2.
   - Total cost for 7 packs of apples = 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, we sum up the total cost of all the items:
- Total cost = Cost of bacon + Cost of chicken + Cost of strawberries + Cost of apples
- Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

Finally, we subtract the total cost from Kelly’s budget to find out how much money she has left:
- Money left = Kelly’s budget - Total cost
- Money left = $65 - $60 = $5.

"To find out how long Elaina's usual concerts run, we need to first subtract the time of the encore from the total runtime of the final concert. The final concert, including the encore, is 65 minutes long. The encore itself is 15 minutes long.

So, the length of the final concert without the encore is:
65 minutes - 15 minutes = 50 minutes

Since the final concert (excluding the encore) is twice as long as her usual concerts, we can find the length of her usual concerts by dividing the length of the final concert (excluding the encore) by 2.

50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes

Therefore, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

"To find out how many chimichangas the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, we can add the number of chimichangas made on each of these days.

On Tuesdays, they make 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesdays, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Fridays, they make twice as many as on Tuesday, which is 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, we add the numbers together:

125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday) = 500 chimichangas

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many microphones do not find space to fit in pairs. Since 20% of the microphones won't fit, we calculate 20% of 50:

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 microphones

This means that 10 microphones are left without a pair. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be paired is:

50 - 10 = 40 microphones

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:

40 / 2 = 20 pairs

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

"To find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we first need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower.

For the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the orchids is \(5 \times 5 = 25\) petals.

For the African daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the daisies is \(4 \times 10 = 40\) petals.

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals of the orchids from the total number of petals of the daisies:
- \(40 - 25 = 15\)

The daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

"To find the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of indoor plants:
   One-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, so:
   \( \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \) indoor plants.

2. Calculate the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:
   \( 100 - 25 = 75 \) plants are not indoor plants.

3. Calculate the number of outdoor plants:
   Two-thirds of the remaining 75 plants are outdoor plants, so:
   \( \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \) outdoor plants.

4. Calculate the number of flowering plants:
   The rest of the plants are flowering plants, so:
   \( 75 - 50 = 25 \) flowering plants.

5. Calculate the percentage of flowering plants:
   To find the percentage, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100:
   \( \frac{25}{100} \times 100 = 25\% \).

"To find out how fast a whirligig spins, we need to first determine the speed of a thingamabob, since the speed of a whirligig is based on the speed of a thingamabob.

We know that:
- A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob.
- A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.

Let's denote the speed of a thingamabob as \( T \) meters per second. According to the information given, the speed of a whatchamacallit is \( 11T \).

Since the speed of a whatchamacallit is 121 meters per second, we can set up the equation:
\[ 11T = 121 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:
\[ T = \frac{121}{11} \]
\[ T = 11 \]

So, a thingamabob spins at 11 meters per second.

Now, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a whirligig \( W \) is:
\[ W = 5T \]
\[ W = 5 \times 11 \]
\[ W = 55 \]

The whirligig spins at 55 meters per second.

"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot every day, we can start by calculating the cost of the yogurt and then use the total cost to find the cost of the carrots.

1. The salad costs $6.
2. The yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.
3. The total cost of the salad and the yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.
4. Ellen pays $11 in total for her daily food, so the cost of the two carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.
5. Since she eats two carrots, the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

The cost of one carrot every day is $1.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the payments for mowing lawns:**
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn.
   - Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( J \).

2. **Calculate the payments for mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns:**
   - Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
   - Tasha mowed Alba's lawn 5 times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

3. **Determine the total payment for mowing lawns:**
   - Joe's payment: \( 6J \) dollars.
   - Kamala's payment: \( 6 \times 3J = 18J \) dollars.
   - Alba's payment: \( 6 \times 5J = 30J \) dollars.
   - Total payment for mowing lawns: \( 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - We know Tasha made $80 in total.
   - Let \( L \) be the amount she made from lemonade sales.
   - Therefore, \( L + 54J = 80 \).

5. **Determine the value of \( J \):**
   - Since Joe paid $6, and we need to find out how many times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn, we need to find \( J \).
   - We know that \( 54J \) is the total amount earned from mowing lawns.
   - To find \( J \), we need to solve for \( J \) in the equation \( 54J \leq 80 \).

6. **Solve for \( J \):**
   - Since \( 54J \) must be a multiple of 6 (because Joe paid $6), and \( 54J \) must be less than or equal to 80, the only possible value for \( J \) is 1 (since \( 54 \times 1 = 54 \) and \( 54 \times 2 = 108 \), which is more than 80).

7. **Calculate the amount made from lemonade sales:**
   - If \( J = 1 \), then \( 54J = 54 \).
   - Therefore, \( L = 80 - 54 = 26 \).

So, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales.

3. Christian’s weight is 8 kg more than Carl’s weight, so Christian’s weight is 71 kg + 8 kg = 79 kg.
4. Harry is 5 kg less than Christian’s weight, so Harry’s weight is 79 kg - 5 kg = 74 kg.

Harry's weight is 74 kg."
"To find out how much profit John makes on his car, we need to calculate his total earnings from renting out his car and then subtract his car payment from that amount.

First, let's calculate his total earnings from renting the car:
- John rents his car 10 times a month.
- Each rental is for 3 hours.
- He gets paid $25 per hour.

Total hours rented per month = 10 times * 3 hours/time = 30 hours
Total earnings per month = 30 hours * $25/hour = $750

Now, we subtract his car payment from his total earnings to find his profit:
Profit = Total earnings - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500 = $250

So, John's profit from renting out his car is $250.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Martha originally had \( M \) notebooks.
2. Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, so Joseph had \( 3M \) notebooks.
3. Martha then bought 5 more notebooks, bringing her total to 7 notebooks. So, \( M + 5 = 7 \).

We can solve for \( M \):

\[ M + 5 = 7 \]
\[ M = 7 - 5 \]
\[ M = 2 \]

So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, Joseph had:

\[ 3M = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

"To find the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed, we first need to calculate the distance Anis rowed. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. Since Dijana rowed 50 miles, we can calculate the additional distance Anis rowed as follows:

Additional distance Anis rowed = 1/5 * 50 miles = 10 miles

Therefore, the total distance Anis rowed is:

Total distance Anis rowed = 50 miles + 10 miles = 60 miles

Now, to find the total distance both of them rowed, we add the distances each of them rowed:

Total distance rowed = Distance Dijana rowed + Distance Anis rowed
Total distance rowed = 50 miles + 60 miles = 110 miles

   - The pot can hold enough soup to fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.

2. **Convert the pot's capacity to a common unit (let's use child bowls for simplicity):**
   - Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls (because 4 adult bowls = 8 child bowls), the pot can hold 8 child bowls.

3. **Calculate the total number of bowls needed for dinner:**
   - Calvin (1 adult) + his wife (1 adult) + 2 children = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 people.
   - Each adult will eat 2 child bowls (since 1 adult bowl = 2 child bowls).
   - Each child will eat 1 child bowl.
   - Total bowls needed for dinner:
     - 2 child bowls (Calvin) + 2 child bowls (wife) + 1 child bowl (child 1) + 1 child bowl (child 2) = 6 child bowls.

4. **Determine the leftover soup:**
   - The pot contains 8 child bowls of soup.
   - 8 child bowls - 6 child bowls used for dinner = 2 child bowls leftover.

5. **Calculate how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup:**
   - There are 2 child bowls of soup left.
   - There are 2 children.
   - Each child can have 2 / 2 = 1 bowl of soup for lunch.

So, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 1 time.

"To determine the total amount of material Jo needs, we first calculate the material required for the small masks and the large masks separately, and then sum these amounts.

1. **Material for Small Masks:**
   - Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
   - For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

2. **Material for Large Masks:**
   - Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
   - For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

3. **Total Material Needed:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's denote Duncan's current age as \( D \) and Adam's current age as \( A \).
2. According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be written as:
   \[
   D - 8 = 2 \times (A - 4)
   \]
3. We are also given that Duncan's current age \( D \) is 60. So we can substitute \( D \) with 60 in the equation:
   \[
   60 - 8 = 2 \times (A - 4)
   \]
4. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[
   52 = 2 \times (A - 4)
   \]
5. Divide both sides by 2 to isolate \( A - 4 \):
   \[
   26 = A - 4
   \]
6. Add 4 to both sides to solve for \( A \):
   \[
   A = 30

Twice Farmer Brown's farm: 2 * 200 acres = 400 acres
Adding 100 acres: 400 acres + 100 acres = 500 acres

Now, we add the sizes of both farms together:
Farmer Brown's farm: 200 acres
Farmer Smith's farm: 500 acres
Total: 200 acres + 500 acres = 700 acres

The two farms together have 700 acres.

"To determine how much money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we first need to calculate the number of packages he completes per hour and then find out his total earnings for the day.

1. Calculate the number of packages Colby completes per hour:
   - He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour.
   - 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

2. Calculate the total number of packages he completes in an eight-hour workday:
   - 40 packages/hour * 8 hours/day = 320 packages/day.

3. Calculate his earnings for the day:
   - He earns $0.20 per package.
   - 320 packages * $0.20/package = $64.00.

Therefore, Colby earns $64.00 in a typical eight-hour workday.

"To determine how many bottles of water John drinks while solving an extreme Sudoku puzzle, we first need to calculate the total time it takes him to solve one.

A normal Sudoku puzzle takes John 45 minutes. An extreme Sudoku puzzle takes 4 times as long, so:

45 minutes * 4 = 180 minutes

John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, which is every 30 minutes. To find out how many bottles he drinks in 180 minutes, we divide the total time by the interval at which he drinks:

180 minutes / 30 minutes per bottle = 6 bottles

So, John drinks 6 bottles of water while solving an extreme Sudoku puzzle.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
2. Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
3. Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
4. There were 20 red balloons.

First, calculate the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons:
\[ 20 \text{ red balloons} \times 2 \text{ pieces of bologna per red balloon} = 40 \text{ pieces of bologna} \]

Next, subtract the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons from the total number of pieces of bologna to find out how many pieces were thrown at the yellow balloons:
\[ 58 \text{ total pieces} - 40 \text{ pieces for red balloons} = 18 \text{ pieces for yellow balloons} \]

Now, determine the number of yellow balloons by dividing the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons by the number of pieces thrown per yellow balloon:
\[ \frac{18 \text{ pieces}}{3 \text{ pieces per yellow balloon}} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

So, the number of yellow balloons in the bundle is:

"To determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs in a 30-day month, we first calculate the total miles driven in that period.

Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so the total miles driven in a month is:
100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since the car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the interval for tune-ups:
3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

"To find out how many hours Bruce works in total over the three days, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. On Tuesday, Bruce works for 5 hours.
2. On Wednesday, he works twice the time he worked on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
3. On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than he did on Wednesday, which is \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, we add up the hours worked over the three days:
- Tuesday: 5 hours
- Wednesday: 10 hours
- Thursday: 8 hours

Total hours worked = \(5 + 10 + 8 = 23\) hours.

"To find out how much allowance Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2, since they both received the same amount.

1. The cost of the cake is $11.
2. The cost of 1 dozen (12) balloons, at $0.5 for 2 balloons, is calculated as follows:
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream, at $7 each, is:
   - 2 * $7 = $14

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14
- Total cost = $28

Since this total amount is the combined allowance of Julia and Nadine, we divide it by 2 to find out how much each received:
- Allowance per person = Total cost / 2
- Allowance per person = $28 / 2
- Allowance per person = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

- There are twice that number playing volleyball, so \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) students playing volleyball.

Next, we add the number of students playing soccer:
- There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so \( 16 + 22 = 38 \) students playing soccer.

Now, we add the students from all the groups:
- Tennis: 6 students
- Volleyball: 12 students
- Soccer: 38 students

Total number of students: \( 6 + 12 + 38 = 56 \)

"To determine the total profit raised by the class from selling lollipops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class.
- Each student sold 10 lollipops.
- There are 30 students.
- Total lollipops sold = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops.

Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
- Each lollipop was sold for $0.8.
- Total revenue = 300 lollipops * $0.8/lollipop = $240.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
- Each lollipop was bought for $0.5.
- Total cost = 300 lollipops * $0.5/lollipop = $150.

Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $240 - $150 = $90.

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

"To find out how many pets Larry has, let's break down the information step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 7 * 3 = 21 fish.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:

- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47

"To determine how many days the loaf of bread will last, we first need to calculate the total number of slices Abby and Josh eat together in one day.

Abby eats 2 slices a day.
Josh eats twice as much as Abby, which means Josh eats 2 * 2 = 4 slices a day.

Together, they eat 2 (Abby) + 4 (Josh) = 6 slices a day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days the loaf will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat together in one day:

24 slices / 6 slices per day = 4 days

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total cups**: Lana has 27 cups.
2. **Rows**: She divides these into 3 rows.
3. **Cinnamon tea**: She uses 15 cups for cinnamon tea.

First, we need to find out how many cups are left for chamomile and mint tea after brewing the cinnamon tea:

\[ 27 \text{ cups} - 15 \text{ cups} = 12 \text{ cups} \]

These 12 cups are divided equally between chamomile and mint tea. Since the number of chamomile and mint tea cups are equal, we divide the 12 cups by 2:

\[ 12 \text{ cups} \div 2 = 6 \text{ cups} \]

So, there are 6 cups of chamomile tea and 6 cups of mint tea in total.

Since these 6 cups of mint tea are divided equally among the 3 rows, we divide the 6 cups by 3:

\[ 6 \text{ cups} \div 3 = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, there are 2 cups of mint tea in each row.

"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we first need to calculate how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours.

Since it takes the sloth 4 hours to complete one trip (down, pick berries, and back up), in 8 hours, the sloth can make:

8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips

Now, to collect 24 berries in 2 trips, the sloth must pick up:

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip

Therefore, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip to meet his goal is 12.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the amount of water in the tank initially:**
   - The pool has 10,000 gallons of water.
   - The tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool.
   - Therefore, the tank is filled with \( \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \) gallons of water.

2. **Calculate the amount of water used over 6 days:**
   - The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day.
   - Over 6 days, the total amount of water used is \( 500 \times 6 = 3,000 \) gallons.

3. **Determine the remaining amount of water in the tank after 6 days:**
   - Initially, the tank has 5,000 gallons.
   - After 6 days, 3,000 gallons have been used.
   - Therefore, the remaining amount of water is \( 5,000 - 3,000 = 2,000 \) gallons.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his total expenses for the month and then see how much he has left to spend.

First, let's calculate the cost of the movies he has already seen:
- 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
- 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56

Next, let's calculate the cost of the popcorn and candy he has already bought:
- 2 tubs of popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
- 4 boxes of candy: 4 * $2 = $8

Now, let's add up all his expenses so far:
- Movies: $50 + $56 = $106
- Snacks: $16 + $8 = $24
- Total expenses: $106 + $24 = $130

Colby's parents give him $150 per month, so let's see how much he has left:
- Remaining money: $150 - $130 = $20

On the last day of the month, which is a Friday, he wants to see a movie, get a popcorn, and a box of candy. The cost for this will be:
- Movie ticket: $10
- Popcorn: $8
- Candy: $2
- Total for the night: $10 + $8 + $2 = $20

Since he has exactly $20 left, he can afford to see one more movie, get a popcorn, and a box of candy.

"To find the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked, we need to calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins separately, and then sum them up.

1. **Calories per mini cinnamon roll:**
   - A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
   - A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal one.
   - Calories per mini cinnamon roll = 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

2. **Total calories for 200 mini cinnamon rolls:**
   - Total calories = 200 rolls * 200 calories/roll = 40,000 calories.

3. **Calories per mini blueberry muffin:**
   - A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
   - A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal one.
   - Calories per mini blueberry muffin = 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

4. **Total calories for 300 mini blueberry muffins:**
   - Total calories = 300 muffins * 150 calories/muffin = 45,000 calories.

5. **Total calories for all pastries:**
   - Total calories = 40,000 calories (from cinnamon rolls) + 45,000 calories (from blueberry muffins) = 85,000 calories.

"To determine how much farther the bus went than the car, we first calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

For the bus:
- Speed: 60 miles per hour
- Time: 5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

For the car:
- Speed: 30 miles per hour
- Time: 8 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled:
- Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car.

The number of stuffed animals is 8.
The number of stacking rings is 9.

Let's add these together:

31 (building blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48 toys.

Now, we subtract the total number of toys Sophie had before the bouncy balls from the new total:

62 (total toys now) - 48 (toys before bouncy balls) = 14 bouncy balls.

So, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14.

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( L \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + L + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   L = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = L + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( L \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]
\[
4J = 80
\]
\[
J = 20
\]

Now that we have \( J \), we can find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[
L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50

"To find out how many total balloons the girls had, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Maria invited 4 friends, so there are 5 people in total (Maria + 4 friends).
2. At the start, Maria gave each of her friends 2 water balloons, and she had 1 for herself. So, the initial distribution is:
   - Each of the 4 friends gets 2 balloons: 4 friends * 2 balloons/friend = 8 balloons.
   - Maria has 1 balloon: 1 balloon.
   - Total initial balloons: 8 + 1 = 9 balloons.

3. Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people:
   - Each person gets 3 more balloons: 5 people * 3 balloons/person = 15 balloons.

4. Adding the initial balloons to the additional balloons given by Maria's mom:
   - Total balloons: 9 (initial) + 15 (additional) = 24 balloons.

So, the total number of balloons the girls had is 24.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings from selling her root crops, we need to multiply the quantity of each type of crop by its respective price and then sum the totals.

For the yams:
6 yams * $1.5/yam = $9.0

For the sweet potatoes:
10 sweet potatoes * $2/sweet potato = $20.0

For the carrots:
4 carrots * $1.25/carrot = $5.0

Now, we add the earnings from each type of crop to find the total earnings:
$9.0 + $20.0 + $5.0 = $34.0

Jen will earn $34.0 if she sells everything.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the time for each part of James's journey.

1. **Swimming the first part:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - 60% of 20 miles is \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time to swim 12 miles is \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \) hours.

2. **Resting on the island:**
   - James rests for half as long as the time he spent swimming the first part.
   - Rest time is \( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \) hours.

3. **Swimming the remaining part:**
   - The remaining distance is \( 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \) miles.
   - James swims the remaining distance at half his original speed, which is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile/hour} \).
   - Time to swim 8 miles at 1 mile per hour is \( \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \) hours.

4. **Total time:**
   - Total time is the sum of the time spent swimming the first part, resting, and swimming the remaining part.
   - Total time = 6 hours (first part) + 3 hours (rest) + 8 hours (remaining part) = 17 hours.

"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we can set up the equation based on the information given:

The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday. If Sam had 70 loaves of bread, then:

Bakery's loaves = 7 * Sam's loaves - 40

Substitute Sam's loaves with 70:

Bakery's loaves = 7 * 70 - 40
Bakery's loaves = 490 - 40
Bakery's loaves = 450

So, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can express these relationships with the following equations:
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Now, substitute these expressions into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To find the total number of pages in the book, we first need to determine how many pages are in one inch of the book. Since the book is printed on paper that is 100 pages to the inch, and the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can calculate the total number of pages as follows:

1.5 inches * 100 pages/inch = 150 pages

However, since each sheet of paper has printing on both sides, each sheet counts as two pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is actually the same as the number we calculated, because the ""100 pages to the inch"" already accounts for both sides of the paper.

150 pages

So, the book has 150 pages."
"To determine how many reports Vince can staple from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, we first need to calculate the total time he spent stapling and then use his stapling rate to find the total number of reports.

1. Calculate the total time from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM:
   - From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.
   - Convert hours to minutes: 15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes.

2. Determine Vince's stapling rate:
   - Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes.
   - This means he staples 2 reports per minute (30 reports / 15 minutes).

3. Calculate the total number of reports stapled:
   - Total time in minutes * stapling rate = 900 minutes * 2 reports/minute = 1800 reports.

Therefore, Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether.

"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the total sleep time and subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up earlier than usual.

1. **Total sleep time without interruptions:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - 8 hours = 8 * 60 minutes = 480 minutes.

2. **Time spent sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - 2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes.

3. **Time she woke up earlier:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual.
   - Usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.

4. **Total sleep time on her bed:**
   - Total sleep time without interruptions: 480 minutes.
   - Subtract the time spent sleepwalking: 480 minutes - 23 minutes = 457 minutes.
   - Subtract the time she woke up earlier: 457 minutes - 5 minutes = 452 minutes.

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day.

"First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan originally has. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen (24) measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

Number of measuring spoons = 2/3 * 24 = 16

Now, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons remaining is:

16 - 6 = 10

To find the total number of utensils remaining, we add the number of measuring cups to the number of measuring spoons remaining:

24 (measuring cups) + 10 (measuring spoons) = 34

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 34.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Occupancy**: The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied.
   - Initial occupied beds = 1000 * (1/5) = 200 beds

2. **Daily Admissions**: 50 patients are admitted each day.

3. **Time Period**: We need to calculate the occupancy after 2 weeks (14 days).
   - Total patients admitted in 14 days = 50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients

4. **Total Occupied Beds After 14 Days**: 
   - Total occupied beds = Initial occupied beds + Patients admitted in 14 days
   - Total occupied beds = 200 + 700 = 900 beds

5. **Unoccupied Beds**:
   - Unoccupied beds = Total capacity - Total occupied beds
   - Unoccupied beds = 1000 - 900 = 100 beds

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100.

"If Courtney reported that the audience was 48 in number but overstated this by 20%, we can find the actual number of people who attended the concert by calculating what 100% (the actual number) would be.

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people who attended the concert. Courtney's report of 48 people is 120% of the actual number, because she overstated by 20%.

So, we have the equation:
\[ 1.20x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.

"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to first determine the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day and then use the information that by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes was four times the number of holes at the end of the first day.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Holes dug on the first day:** 10 holes
2. **Holes dug on the second day:** 13 holes
3. **Holes dug on the third day:** 8 holes, but 2 holes were filled in, so the net holes dug on the third day are 8 - 2 = 6 holes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of holes by the end of the third day:

- Total holes by the end of the third day = 10 (first day) + 13 (second day) + 6 (third day) = 29 holes

According to the problem, by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes was four times the number of holes at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day was 10, so:

- Total holes by the end of the fourth day = 4 * 10 = 40 holes

To find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day, we subtract the total number of holes by the end of the third day from the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day:

- Holes dug on the fourth day = 40 (total by the end of the fourth day) - 29 (total by the end of the third day) = 11 holes

So, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

The cost of the supplies is $400. 

50% of $400 is calculated as follows:
50% of $400 = 0.50 * $400 = $200

The total cost for the travel tickets is 50% more than the cost of the supplies, so:
Total travel cost = Cost of supplies + 50% of the cost of supplies
Total travel cost = $400 + $200 = $600

The travel costs $600.

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of Pokémon each person has caught with variables:
- Let \( A \) be the number of Pokémon Alex has caught.
- Let \( S \) be the number of Pokémon Stan has caught.
- Let \( W \) be the number of Pokémon Adelwolfe has caught.

We are given the following information:
1. Together they have caught 339 Pokémon:
   \[
   A + S + W = 339
   \]
2. Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan:
   \[
   A = S + 5
   \]
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokémon as Adelwolfe:
   \[
   S = 4W - 13
   \]

We can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) into the first equation to solve for \( W \).

First, substitute \( A = S + 5 \) into the total equation:
\[
(S + 5) + S + W = 339
\]
Simplify this equation:
\[
2S + W + 5 = 339
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
2S + W = 334
\]

Next, substitute \( S = 4W - 13 \) into the equation \( 2S + W = 334 \):
\[
2(4W - 13) + W = 334
\]
Distribute the 2:
\[
8W - 26 + W = 334
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
9W - 26 = 334
\]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[
9W = 360
\]
Divide by 9:
\[
W = 40
\]

Now that we have \( W \), we can find \( S \):
\[
S = 4W - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.

"To find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we need to determine the total number of episodes and then multiply that by the length of each episode.

Given that each episode is 20 minutes long and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can set up the following relationship:

Number of episodes = 20 / 2 = 10 episodes

Now, to find the total time spent watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

Total time = Number of episodes * Length of each episode
Total time = 10 episodes * 20 minutes/episode
Total time = 200 minutes

So, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show if he watches every episode.

   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles}\)

2. **Second leg of the journey (north):**
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles}\)

3. **Third leg of the journey (south):**
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles}\)

Now, we calculate the net distance traveled south:
- Total distance south: \(300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles}\)
- Total distance north: \(36 \text{ miles}\)

Net distance south:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Emil's Current Age**: Emil is currently 19 years old.
2. **Emil's Age When He Turns 24**: In 5 years, Emil will be 24 years old.
3. **Dad's Age When Emil Turns 24**: At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad. Therefore, Emil's dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.
4. **Dad's Current Age**: Since this will be in 5 years, Emil's dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old.
5. **Brother's Age When Emil Turns 24**: At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother. Therefore, Emil's brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.
6. **Brother's Current Age**: Since this will be in 5 years, Emil's brother is currently 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

Now, we need to find the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother:
- Dad's current age: 43 years
- Brother's current age: 7 years

Sum of their ages: 43 + 7 = 50

"To find out how many beads Adrianne has altogether, we need to add up the beads she received from her mother, her sister, and her friend.

1. Her mother gave her 20 beads.
2. Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, which is 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
3. Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, which is 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, we add all the beads together:

20 (from mother) + 30 (from sister) + 40 (from friend) = 90 beads

So, Adrianne has 90 beads altogether.

"To determine how many servings of crawfish Joe has, we first need to calculate the total amount of crawfish he caught over the three days.

1. On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
2. On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
3. On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) pounds.

Now, we add up the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[3 + 12 + 6 = 21\] pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, the total number of servings Joe has is:
\[\frac{21}{3} = 7\] servings.

"First, let's calculate the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Since 20% of the class are football players:

20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after the football players are accounted for:

30 students - 6 football players = 24 students

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band:

25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students

Now, we can add the number of football players to the number of cheerleaders and band members to find out how many students are leaving early:

6 football players + 6 cheerleaders or band members = 12 students

Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is:

12"
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we first need to determine the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size five boots, we can calculate Charlie's boot size as follows:

Charlie's boot size = 5 * Sophie's boot size
Charlie's boot size = 5 * 5
Charlie's boot size = 25

Now that we know the size of both Charlie's and Sophie's boots, we can calculate the average size:

Average size = (Sophie's boot size + Charlie's boot size) / 2
Average size = (5 + 25) / 2
Average size = 30 / 2
Average size = 15

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet**: Since 12 inches is equal to 1 foot, each flower is 1 foot wide.

2. **Calculate the total space required for one flower and the space between it and the next flower**: Each flower requires 1 foot of space, and there needs to be 1.5 feet of space between each flower. Therefore, the total space required for one flower and the space between it and the next flower is:
   \[
   1 \text{ foot (flower)} + 1.5 \text{ feet (space)} = 2.5 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed**: The flower bed is 111 feet long. To find out how many flowers can fit, we divide the length of the flower bed by the total space required for one flower and the space between it and the next flower:
   \[
   \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/flower}} = 44.4 \text{ flowers}
   \]
   Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a flower, we round down to the nearest whole number:
   \[
   44 \text{ flowers}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of additional flowers Pat needs to buy**: Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional flowers she needs to buy is:
   \[
   44 \text{ flowers} - 17 \text{ flowers} = 27 \text{ flowers}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional flowers**: Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for 27 flowers is:
   \[
   27 \text{ flowers} \times 6 \text{ dollars/flower} = 162 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we first need to determine how many pretzels he eats in a day. Since Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day and his brother eats half as many, we can calculate the brother's daily consumption as follows:

Brother's daily pretzels = 18 pretzels / 2 = 9 pretzels

Now, to find out how many pretzels the brother eats in a week, we multiply the daily amount by the number of days in a week:

Brother's weekly pretzels = 9 pretzels/day * 7 days/week = 63 pretzels/week

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.

"To find out how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of the plants for one basket and then multiply that by the number of baskets.

For one basket:
- The cost of 3 petunias is 3 petunias * $3.00/petunia = $9.00
- The cost of 2 sweet potato vines is 2 vines * $2.50/vine = $5.00

The total cost for one basket is $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00

For 5 baskets, the total cost is 5 baskets * $14.00/basket = $70.00

Therefore, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets.

"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil, and they are planting 4 sunflowers:
4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds

Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil, and they are planting 10 carnations:
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Now, we add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
12 pounds (for sunflowers) + 15 pounds (for carnations) = 27 pounds

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. After planting the sunflowers and carnations, the remaining soil is:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Each rose requires 1 pound of soil. Therefore, with the remaining 3 pounds of soil, they can plant:
3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"To determine how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount Jessica sets aside each month for shoes.
2. Determine the total amount set aside in a year.
3. Calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy with the total amount.

Step 1: Calculate the monthly savings for shoes.
Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for shoes.
25% of $2,000.00 = 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00

Step 2: Determine the total amount set aside in a year.
Jessica saves $500.00 each month, so in a year (12 months), she will save:
$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Step 3: Calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy.
Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so the number of pairs she can buy is:
$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the task into two parts: peeling and sauteing.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, we divide the total number of shrimp by the rate at which she peels them:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sauteing the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To saute 90 shrimp, we first determine how many batches of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp:
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
     \]
   - Since each batch takes 10 minutes to saute, the total time to saute 90 shrimp is:
     \[
     \text{Time to saute 90 shrimp} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to peel and saute 90 shrimp is the sum of the time to peel and the time to saute:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cooling on Low for 3 Hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 3 hours, the temperature drops by \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) degrees.

2. **Cooling on High for 4 Hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   - In 4 hours, the temperature drops by \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) degrees.

3. **Total Cooling:**
   - The total cooling effect is \( 6 + 12 = 18 \) degrees.

4. **Warming Up for 2 Hours:**
   - The room warms up by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 2 hours, the temperature increases by \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) degrees.

5. **Net Temperature Change:**
   - The net change in temperature is the total cooling minus the warming: \( 18 - 4 = 14 \) degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet the second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since the comet appears every 75 years, the first time Bill saw the comet must have been 75 years before he saw it the second time.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we can break down the information given:

1. Electric bill: 1 check per month
2. Gas bill: 1 check per month
3. Church: 2 checks per month
4. Pest and lawn service: 1 check per quarter (4 times a year)

Now, let's calculate the total number of checks for each category:

- Electric bill: 1 check/month * 12 months/year = 12 checks/year
- Gas bill: 1 check/month * 12 months/year = 12 checks/year
- Church: 2 checks/month * 12 months/year = 24 checks/year
- Pest and lawn service: 1 check/quarter * 4 quarters/year = 4 checks/year

Adding these together gives us the total number of checks Buford writes per year:

12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52 checks/year

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of trips the first plane makes:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 44 \times 2 = 88 \) trips.

2. **Calculate the number of trips to Greece:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - So, the number of trips to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \) trips.

3. **Calculate the number of trips to France and Germany:**
   - The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany.
   - The remaining flights are \( 88 - 66 = 22 \) trips.
   - Since these 22 trips are split equally between France and Germany, the number of trips to France is \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \) trips.

Therefore, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is 11.

"To find the combined length of time the three wolves' howls, we first need to determine the duration of each wolf's howl.

1. Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, which is \(20 \times 2 = 40\) seconds.
3. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, which is \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Now, we add up the durations of their howls:
\[ 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[ 120 \div 60 = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and then subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6. His father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 (from his mother) + $12 (from his father) = $18.

The cost of the trousers is $30. Therefore, the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings is $30 - $18 = $12.

"To find Wilfred's age, let's start by using the information given:

1. The total age of the children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old.
3. Alessandro is 4 years old.
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar: 3 years
- Alessandro: 4 years
- Helene: \( H \) years
- Wilfred: \( W \) years

The total age of the children is the sum of their ages:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]

Simplifying this, we get:
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice this average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, Wilfred is 3 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's first establish the relationship between the size of the slices for adults and kids. Let the size of each kid's slice be \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

The total number of slices is 6 (2 for the adults and 4 for the kids). The total watermelon can be represented as the sum of all the slices:

\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

This means the entire watermelon is divided into 8 equal parts of size \( x \).

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \), which is equivalent to 2 parts out of the 8 parts. To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2x}{8x} \times 100\% = \frac{2}{8} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he will spend on rounds and appointments, and then subtract this from his total available time at the clinic.

1. **Time spent on rounds:**
   - Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients.
   - Each inpatient check takes 20 minutes.
   - Total time for rounds = 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes.

2. **Time spent on appointments:**
   - Doctor Jones has 10 appointments.
   - Each appointment takes 30 minutes.
   - Total time for appointments = 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes.

3. **Total time spent on rounds and appointments:**
   - Total time = 180 minutes (rounds) + 300 minutes (appointments) = 480 minutes.

4. **Convert total time spent to hours:**

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as \( x \).

Lisa sold \( 3.5 \) boxes, so she sold \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold \( 4.5 \) boxes, so he sold \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold \( 64 \) chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:

\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by \( 8 \):

\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]

\[ x = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the costs and the number of sessions. However, the question does not specify the revenue or the fee charged per student per session, which is necessary to calculate earnings. Instead, I will calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the cost per student for the given conditions.

First, let's calculate the cost of renting the studio:
- The studio costs $25 per session.
- The studio is rented 3 days a week.
- Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the total number of sessions in a month is 3 sessions/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.
- Therefore, the total cost of renting the studio in a month is 12 sessions * $25/session = $300.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the students:
- The cost per student per session is $1.50.
- There are 10 students.
- The total cost for the students per session is 10 students * $1.50/student/session = $15/session.
- The total cost for the students in a month is 12 sessions * $15/session = $180.

Now, let's add the two costs together to get the total cost for the dance studio in a month:
- Total cost = Cost of renting the studio + Cost for the students
- Total cost = $300 + $180 = $480

Since the question asks for the expected earnings and we only have the costs, we cannot provide the earnings without knowing the revenue. If you meant to ask for the total cost, the answer is:

$480

If you need the earnings, please provide the fee charged per student per session."
"To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we first need to determine how many chocolate bars are in each of their boxes.

For Peter:
- He has 4 boxes and a total of 64 chocolate bars.
- The number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes is \( \frac{64}{4} = 16 \).

For Martha:
- She has 7 boxes and a total of 56 chocolate bars.
- The number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes is \( \frac{56}{7} = 8 \).

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes from the number in each of Peter's boxes:
- \( 16 - 8 = 8 \).

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume to gallons using the given conversion factor.
3. Calculate the cost based on the price per gallon.

Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.
The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) can be calculated using the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 25 \, \text{ft} \times 14 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \]
\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Step 2: Convert the volume to gallons.
The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons.
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 5.9 \]
\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \]

Step 3: Calculate the cost.
The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon.
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{USD/gallon} \]

   - Number of female students over 16 = 1500 - 375 = 1125 students.
5. **Students Under 16 Years Old**: The other half of the total students are under 16 years old.
   - Number of students under 16 = 3000 / 2 = 1500 students.
6. **Male Students Under 16**: One-half of the students under 16 years old are male.
   - Number of male students under 16 = 1500 / 2 = 750 students.
7. **Female Students Under 16**: The rest of the students under 16 years old are female.
   - Number of female students under 16 = 1500 - 750 = 750 students.

Now, to find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 and the number of female students under 16:
- Total female students = 1125 (over 16) + 750 (under 16) = 1875 students.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run:
   \[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ laps} \]
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run:
   \[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ laps} \]
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run:
   \[ 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ laps} \]

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:**
   - Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity on the first day.
     \[ \text{Wanda's first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons} \]
   - Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda on the first day.
     \[ \text{Ms. B's first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons} \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   \[ \text{Total first day} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons} \]

3. **Calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the second day:**
   - Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[ \text{Wanda's second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]
   - Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[ \text{Ms. B's second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons} \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the second day:**
   \[ \text{Total second day} = 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons} \]

5. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped over the two days:**
   \[ \text{Total water pumped} = 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons} \]

6. **Calculate the remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank:**
   \[ \text{Remaining water} = 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is:

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge of 28%.

1. **Calculate the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank before the last 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know this equals 28% of the total capacity.
   - Therefore, \( x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \).

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x \times 0.804357 = 0.28 \)
   - \( x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \)
   - \( x \approx 0.348 \) or 34.8%

3. **Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank before the first 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know this equals 34.8% of the total capacity.
   - Therefore, \( y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348 \).

4. **Solve for \( y \):**
   - \( y \times 0.59049 = 0.348 \)
   - \( y = \frac{0.348}{0.59049} \)
   - \( y \approx 0.589 \) or 58.9%

Thus, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 58.9%.

"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to save, which is 20% of $10,000.

20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Next, we calculate Janet's total earnings per hour, which is the sum of her wages and tips:

$10 (wages) + $15 (tips) = $25 per hour

Now, we calculate her weekly earnings by multiplying her hourly earnings by the number of hours she works each week:

$25 per hour * 40 hours per week = $1,000 per week

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

$2,000 / $1,000 per week = 2 weeks

Therefore, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save up the down payment for the car.

"To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased.

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: 3 * $0.50 = $1.50
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: 4 * $0.50 = $2.00
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: 2 * $1.00 = $2.00
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, we add up the total cost of these fruits:

$1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10, so we subtract the total cost of the fruits from his budget to find out how much money he has left:

$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum to find out how many he can buy:

$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compounded growth:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the future value (the price after three years),
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price ($120),
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( n \) is the number of years (3).

Plugging in the values:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be:

"To find out how many portraits and selfies Olivia had, we need to first determine how many pictures were in each album. Since she put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Now, we know that 3 albums were selfies and 2 albums were portraits. To find out the total number of selfies and portraits, we multiply the number of pictures per album by the number of albums for each category:

Selfies: 3 albums * 9 pictures/album = 27 pictures
Portraits: 2 albums * 9 pictures/album = 18 pictures

Adding the selfies and portraits together gives us the total number of selfies and portraits:

27 selfies + 18 portraits = 45 pictures

So, Olivia had 45 pictures that were either selfies or portraits.

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \) because she sold twice as many small ones as large ones.

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ 120 = (12 \times x) + (4 \times 2x) \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 120 = 12x + 8x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe in one day. 

1. A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
2. With an iron pickaxe, a dwarf can mine twice as much, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds of ore per day.
3. With a steel pickaxe, a dwarf can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. Therefore, the amount mined with a steel pickaxe is \(24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36\) pounds of ore per day.

Now, we need to calculate how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in 30 days with steel pickaxes:

1. One dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 36 pounds of ore per day.
2. Therefore, 40 dwarves can mine \(40 \times 36 = 1440\) pounds of ore per day.
3. Over 30 days, 40 dwarves can mine \(1440 \times 30 = 43200\) pounds of ore.

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the different scenarios where he would not have to turn it in and then subtract this from 100%.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - There is a 50% chance that there will be a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework.
   - If this happens, Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - There is a 50% chance that the normal teacher will be there.
   - If the normal teacher is there, there is a 40% chance she will give everyone an extension.
   - If the normal teacher is there and does not give an extension, there is a 20% chance Marcus can convince her his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension.

Let's break down the probabilities:

- **Probability of not having to turn in homework if the normal teacher is there:**
  - Probability of getting an extension for the whole class: 40% or 0.40
  - Probability of getting a personal extension: 20% or 0.20
  - Probability of not having to turn in homework (either whole class extension or personal extension):
    \[
    0.40 + (0.60 \times 0.20) = 0.40 + 0.12 = 0.52

"To determine how long it will take Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we need to calculate the total amount of money he needs to earn and then figure out how long it will take him to earn that amount with his new income.

1. **Calculate the total amount of loans:**
   - Jim takes $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.
   - Total loans = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000

2. **Calculate the total income lost from not working:**
   - Jim could have earned $25,000 per year if he had not gone to college.
   - Total income lost = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn:**
   - Total amount = Total loans + Total income lost
   - Total amount = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

4. **Calculate Jim's new income after college:**
   - His college degree tripled his income.
   - New income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

5. **Determine how long it will take to earn the total amount:**
   - Time required = Total amount / New income
   - Time required = $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years

Therefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"To determine how much fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces he will use. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each piece of fabric will be:
6 feet (length of the bed) + 2 feet = 8 feet

And the width of each piece of fabric will be:
8 feet (width of the bed) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
8 feet (length) * 10 feet (width) = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost for the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately and then add them together.

For the chicken salad:
10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.00

For the pasta salad:
6 people * $6.00 per person = $36.00

Now, we add the two amounts together to get the total cost:
$65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is:
$101.00"
"To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

1. On the first race, he lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 on the first race, twice that amount is $10, and $1 more than that is $11. So, he won $11 on the second race.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11 on the second race, 1.5 times that amount is $16.50. So, he lost $16.50 on the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- First race loss: $5
- Second race win: -$11 (this is a win, so it reduces the total loss)
- Third race loss: $16.50

Total loss = $5 - $11 + $16.50 = $11.50

Since there were 3 races, we divide the total loss by 3 to find the average loss per race:
Average loss = Total loss / Number of races = $11.50 / 3

Now, let's calculate the average:
Average loss = $11.50 / 3 = $3.8333...

Rounded to the nearest cent, the average loss is $3.83.

"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we first need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Since heights are given in both feet and inches, we will convert everything to inches for simplicity.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's initial height in inches is:
4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer, so his new height is:
48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Cole's initial height was 50 inches, and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his new height is:
50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier's new heights:
52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch

The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is 1 inch.

"Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is $420.

1. Calculate the total number of days worked by the team.
2. Determine the fraction of a day worked each day.
3. Convert the fraction of a day to hours.
4. Multiply the total number of days by the number of hours worked each day to get the total hours worked by the team.
5. Divide the total hours worked by the team by the number of painters to find the hours worked by each painter.

Let's go through these steps:

1. Total number of days worked by the team:
   3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

2. Fraction of a day worked each day:
   3/8 of a day

3. Convert the fraction of a day to hours:
   1 day = 24 hours
   3/8 of a day = 3/8 * 24 hours = 9 hours

4. Total hours worked by the team:
   21 days * 9 hours/day = 189 hours

5. Hours worked by each painter:
   189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours

Each painter put in 47.25 hours of work.

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:

\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), first combine like terms:

\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:

\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we know the number of balls retrieved in the second set is 6. The number of balls retrieved in the first set is:

\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the 3 years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year, which means each year the car is worth 79% (100% - 21%) of its value from the previous year.

The formula to calculate the value after depreciation is:

\[ \text{Final Value} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Where:
- Initial Value = $20,000
- Depreciation Rate = 21% or 0.21
- Number of Years = 2010 - 2007 = 3

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Final Value} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Value} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Value} = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ \text{Final Value} = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is $9860.78.

"To find out how much James pays for insurance a year after his accident, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.
2. Multiply the increased monthly cost by 12 to find the annual cost.

First, let's calculate the increased monthly cost. The normal cost is $120 a month, and it increased by 60% after the accident.

The increase in cost is 60% of $120:
\[ \text{Increase} = 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the new monthly cost is:
\[ \text{New Monthly Cost} = 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Next, we calculate the annual cost by multiplying the new monthly cost by 12:
\[ \text{Annual Cost} = 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for insurance.

"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we first need to calculate the number of loads he does each week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a year.

1. **Weekly Laundry Calculation:**
   - Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed.
   - The laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time.
   - For the twin beds, he needs to do 2 loads (since 4 twin sets / 2 sets per load = 2 loads).
   - For the king size bed, he needs to do 1 load (since 1 king set / 1 set per load = 1 load).
   - Therefore, each week, Greg does 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads of laundry.

2. **Yearly Laundry Calculation:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Greg does 3 loads of laundry each week.
   - Therefore, in a year, he does 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads of laundry.

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to calculate the total amount of food consumed per day and then divide the total amount of food by this daily consumption.

1. First, calculate the total amount of food consumed per feeding:
   - Each cat eats 60 grams per feeding.
   - There are 3 cats.
   - Therefore, for one feeding, the total amount of food consumed is \( 60 \text{ grams/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 180 \text{ grams} \).

2. Since the cats are fed twice a day, the total amount of food consumed per day is:
   - \( 180 \text{ grams/feeding} \times 2 \text{ feedings/day} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \).

3. Now, to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we divide the total amount of food by the daily consumption:
   - \( 720 \text{ grams} \div 360 \text{ grams/day} = 2 \text{ days} \).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine how many slices Jake ate:**
   - Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake.
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Therefore, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices.

2. **Determine how many slices Silvia ate:**
   - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake.
   - Jake ate 7 slices.
   - Therefore, Silvia ate \(2 \times 7 = 14\) slices.

3. **Calculate the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Jake ate 7 slices.
   - Silvia ate 14 slices.
   - Total slices eaten = \(10 + 7 + 14 = 31\).

4. **Verify the total number of slices available:**
   - There were 4 pizzas, each with 8 slices.
   - Total slices available = \(4 \times 8 = 32\).

Since the total slices eaten (31) is less than the total slices available (32), the calculation is consistent.

The total number of slices they ate is:

"Let's denote the time Donovan spent on his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time spent on the meal is the sum of the time Betsy and Donovan each spent, which is 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which took 18 minutes longer, is:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To determine the cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter, we first need to understand the promotion and how it applies to his purchase.

1. Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter.
2. The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off.""

This means for every two pounds of butter, Dennis will pay full price for one pound and half price for the second pound.

- Cost for 1 pound of butter: $4.00
- Cost for 1 pound of butter at half price: $4.00 / 2 = $2.00

For every 2 pounds of butter, the total cost is:
- $4.00 (full price) + $2.00 (half price) = $6.00

Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, we can calculate the total cost as follows:
- 6 pounds / 2 pounds per set = 3 sets of 2 pounds
- 3 sets * $6.00 per set = $18.00

Therefore, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is $18.00.

"To determine how many quarters Jenny leaves with, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 15 roses she bought and then figure out the change she receives.

1. **Calculate the cost of 15 roses:**
   - The cost for a dozen (12) roses is $15.
   - Jenny bought 15 roses, which is 12 + 3 roses.
   - The cost for 12 roses is $15.
   - The cost for 3 additional roses is 3 * $2 = $6.
   - Total cost for 15 roses = $15 + $6 = $21.

2. **Determine the amount of money Jenny has:**
   - Jenny has five 5 dollar bills, so she has 5 * $5 = $25.

3. **Calculate the change Jenny should receive:**
   - Change = Total money - Total cost = $25 - $21 = $4.

4. **Convert the change into quarters:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Number of quarters = $4 / $0.25 = 16.

Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.

"To find out how much money Terry makes in total, we need to calculate the total sales for each item and then sum them up.

1. For the milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 per milkshake = $33.00
2. For the burger platters: 9 burger platters * $11 per burger platter = $99.00
3. For the sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 per soda = $30.00

Now, we add up the totals for each item to get the total sales:

$33.00 (milkshakes) + $99.00 (burger platters) + $30.00 (sodas) = $162.00

Therefore, Terry makes a total of $162.00.

"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the total time from when he starts waiting until the fourth train arrives.

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. Therefore, the first train leaves 30 minutes after Paul starts waiting.
2. The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after Paul starts waiting. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. Therefore, the second train leaves 60 + 5 = 65 minutes after Paul starts waiting.
3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes after Paul starts waiting. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it leaves 125 minutes after Paul starts waiting.
4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

Therefore, Paul will wait for a total of 145 minutes for his train.

"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to calculate how many toothpicks she has already saved and how many more she needs.

Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

The total number of toothpicks required for the sculpture is 200. Therefore, the number of toothpicks she still needs to collect is:

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, the number of additional weeks she will need to save to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks is:

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.
2. Calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend.
3. Determine the discount Mr. Rogers' friend received from the original price.
4. Calculate the percentage discount based on the original price.

**Step 1: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.**

The watch was sold at 75% of its original price. The original price of the watch is $2000.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend.**

Mr. Rogers sold the watch at 120% of the price he paid for it.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

**Step 3: Determine the discount Mr. Rogers' friend received from the original price.**

The original price of the watch is $2000, and Mr. Rogers' friend bought it for $1800.

\[ \text{Discount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the percentage discount based on the original price.**

\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

The percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%.

"To find out how many jellyfish 5 springs would create in 4 hours, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Determine how many seconds are in 4 hours.
2. Calculate how many jellyfish one spring would create in that time.
3. Multiply that number by 5 to account for all the springs.

Step 1: There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in one hour. Therefore, in 4 hours, there are 4 * 3600 = 14400 seconds.

Step 2: If one spring creates one jellyfish every second, then in 14400 seconds, one spring would create 14400 jellyfish.

Step 3: If there are 5 springs, then the total number of jellyfish created would be 5 * 14400 = 72000 jellyfish.

"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the cost of the bananas both ways and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought:
10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas

Next, we calculate the cost if she bought the bananas individually:
40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00

Now, we calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches:
10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00

Finally, we find the savings by subtracting the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:
$32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00

Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( S \) represent the amount of fence Sam gets, and \( H \) represent the amount of fence Harry gets. According to the problem:

1. The total amount of fence is 100 feet.
2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.

We can express these conditions with the following equations:
\[ S + H = 100 \]
\[ H = S + 60 \]

Now, substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, solve for \( S \):
\[ 2S = 100 - 60 \]
\[ 2S = 40 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"To solve this problem, we can use a simple proportion to find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years. The growth rate is 8 inches in 4 years. We can set up the proportion as follows:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = \frac{x \text{ inches}}{13 \text{ years}} \]

To find \( x \), we can cross-multiply and solve for \( x \):

\[ 8 \times 13 = 4 \times x \]

\[ 104 = 4x \]

\[ x = \frac{104}{4} \]

\[ x = 26 \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

"To determine how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during the month, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply by their respective prices.

1. **Total bikes sold**: 300
2. **Trekking bikes sold**: Half of the total bikes, so \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \) Trekking bikes.
3. **BMX bikes sold**: 15% of the total bikes, so \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \) BMX bikes.
4. **MTB bikes sold**: The rest of the bikes, so \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \) MTB bikes.

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:

- **Earnings from Trekking bikes**: \( 150 \times 450 = 67,500 \) dollars.
- **Earnings from BMX bikes**: \( 45 \times 250 = 11,250 \) dollars (since a BMX bike is half the price of an MTB, \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \) dollars).
- **Earnings from MTB bikes**: \( 105 \times 500 = 52,500 \) dollars.

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes:

\[ 67,500 + 11,250 + 52,500 = 131,250 \]

Marcel earned a total of 131,250 dollars from selling bicycles during that month.

"To determine how many hours a week John spends learning, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class during the week and the additional time he spends on Saturday and Sunday.

1. **Calculate the total minutes spent in class during the week:**
   - John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes each day, which totals 8 classes a day.
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.
   - He goes to class for 5 days a week.

   Total minutes per day = 8 classes/day * 40 minutes/class = 320 minutes/day
   Total minutes per week = 320 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes/week

2. **Calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.

   Extra minutes on Saturday = 1600 minutes/week * 1/16 = 100 minutes
   Extra minutes on Sunday = 1600 minutes/week * 1/16 = 100 minutes

3. **Calculate the total weekly learning time:**
   - Total minutes spent learning during the week = 1600 minutes
   - Total extra minutes on weekends = 100 minutes (Saturday) + 100 minutes (Sunday) = 200 minutes

   Total weekly learning time in minutes = 1600 minutes + 200 minutes = 1800 minutes

"To determine the cost to paint the room, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

The north and south walls are each 10 feet wide by 8 feet high, so the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are each 5 feet wide by 8 feet high, so the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

The total area to be painted is the sum of the areas of all four walls:
\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

A gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, so the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost to paint the room is:

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her 9,300-mile journey in June, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June and how many miles she plans to hike daily.

June has 30 days. If Soledad hikes twice a day, covering 125 miles each time, she will hike:

125 miles/hike * 2 hikes/day = 250 miles/day

Now, let's calculate the total miles she will hike in June at this rate:

250 miles/day * 30 days = 7,500 miles

Soledad's goal is to hike 9,300 miles. The difference between her goal and the distance she will cover at her current plan is:

9,300 miles - 7,500 miles = 1,800 miles

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we divide the additional miles needed by the number of days in June:

1,800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles/day

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her 9,300-mile journey on time.

"To find out how much the store will have received after all the balls are sold, we need to calculate the total revenue from each color of ball and then sum these amounts.

1. Calculate the revenue from the red balls:
   - There are 3 red balls, and each costs $9.
   - Revenue from red balls = 3 * $9 = $27

2. Calculate the revenue from the blue balls:
   - There are 11 blue balls, and each costs $5.
   - Revenue from blue balls = 11 * $5 = $55

3. Calculate the revenue from the green balls:
   - There are 25 green balls, and each costs $3.
   - Revenue from green balls = 25 * $3 = $75

4. Sum the revenues from all the balls to get the total revenue:
   - Total revenue = Revenue from red balls + Revenue from blue balls + Revenue from green balls
   - Total revenue = $27 + $55 + $75 = $157

The store will have received $157 after all the balls are sold.

"First, let's clarify the names in the problem. The names mentioned in the purchase of apples are Pierre, Paul, and Jacques. However, the question later refers to Peter and James, which are not mentioned initially. I will assume that ""Peter"" is a typo and should be ""Pierre,"" and ""James"" is a typo and should be ""Jacques.""

Now, let's solve the problem:

1. Pierre (Peter) wants a quarter of the 12 kg of apples:
   \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \, \text{kg} = 3 \, \text{kg} \)

2. Paul wants a third of the 12 kg of apples:
   \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 \, \text{kg} = 4 \, \text{kg} \)

3. The total amount of apples taken by Pierre and Paul is:
   \( 3 \, \text{kg} + 4 \, \text{kg} = 7 \, \text{kg} \)

4. The amount of apples left for Jacques (James) is:
   \( 12 \, \text{kg} - 7 \, \text{kg} = 5 \, \text{kg} \)

So, Jacques will have 5 kg of apples left.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which the lighthouse blinks. We know that the lighthouse blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. We can find the rate of blinking per minute by dividing the total number of blinks by the total number of minutes:

\[ \text{Rate of blinking} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for the lighthouse to blink 459 times. We can do this by dividing the total number of blinks we want (459) by the rate of blinking (51 blinks per minute):

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take 9 minutes for the lighthouse to blink 459 times.

"To find out how many more female fish than male fish Tate has, we need to first calculate the total number of male and female fish after Tate buys the additional fish.

Initially, Tate has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfish
- 5 female goldfish

After buying more fish, Tate adds:
- 2 male guppies
- 1 female guppy
- 2 male goldfish
- 3 female goldfish

Now, let's calculate the new totals:
- Total male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Total female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Total male goldfish: 3 + 2 = 5
- Total female goldfish: 5 + 3 = 8

Next, we sum the totals for male and female fish:
- Total male fish: 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfish) = 11
- Total female fish: 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfish) = 16

Finally, we find the difference between the number of female and male fish:
- Difference: 16 (female fish) - 11 (male fish) = 5

So, Tate has 5 more female fish than male fish.

"To find out how many miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the one-way distance to his parents' house.
2. Double that distance to account for the round trip.
3. Multiply the round trip distance by the number of visits per month.

Step 1: One-way distance
Since it takes John 2 hours to drive to his parents' house at a speed of 70 mph, we can calculate the one-way distance using the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Step 2: Round trip distance
The round trip distance is twice the one-way distance:
\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

Step 3: Monthly distance
John visits his parents twice a month, so the total monthly distance is:
\[ \text{Monthly distance} = 280 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 560 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents is:
560"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how many miles Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can calculate the total distance she will walk in 7 days by multiplying the number of miles she walks per day by the number of days:
   \[ \text{Sofie's total distance} = 10 \, \text{miles/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 70 \, \text{miles} \]

2. According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. This means that the distance Brian will walk is half of the distance Sofie will walk:
   \[ \text{Brian's total distance} = \frac{\text{Sofie's total distance}}{2} = \frac{70 \, \text{miles}}{2} = 35 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days.

"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we can start by calculating the total number of toys produced by the other four workers during their 10-hour shift.

First, we calculate the production of the two workers who produce 6 toys per hour:
2 workers * 6 toys/hour * 10 hours = 120 toys

Next, we calculate the production of the two workers who produce 4 toys per hour:
2 workers * 4 toys/hour * 10 hours = 80 toys

Adding these together gives the total production by the four workers:
120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys

The manufacturer needs 400 toys in total and still needs 20 toys after the shift, which means that 380 toys were produced during the shift. Since the four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced the difference:
380 toys - 200 toys = 180 toys

The fifth worker worked for 10 hours, so the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is:
180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys/hour

"To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs, we first need to calculate the weight of each of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog.

Kory’s dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah’s first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah’s second dog is half the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weights of all three dogs:
\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

3. Calculate how many small bags he can make with 10 M&M's in each bag.

Step 1: Total weight of M&M's
John buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces.
Total weight = 3 bags * 10 ounces/bag = 30 ounces

Step 2: Total number of M&M's
There are 30 M&M's in each ounce.
Total number of M&M's = 30 ounces * 30 M&M's/ounce = 900 M&M's

Step 3: Number of small bags
Each small bag contains 10 M&M's.
Number of small bags = 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag = 90 bags

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( V \) represent Vince's age two years ago. According to the problem, two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. Liam is currently 16 years old, so two years ago, Liam was 14 years old. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 14 = 2V \]

Now, solve for \( V \):

\[ V = \frac{14}{2} \]
\[ V = 7 \]

This means Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age from two years ago:

1. **Total eggs painted by all four**: 56 eggs.
2. **Eggs painted by Camden and Sarah**: 30 eggs.
3. **Eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline**: 56 - 30 = 26 eggs.
4. **Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs**: Let's denote the number of eggs each painted by \( A \). Therefore, \( 2A = 26 \), so \( A = 13 \).

5. **Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, with Camden painting 12 more than Sarah**:
   - Let \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.
   - Then Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs.
   - The total number of eggs painted by Camden and Sarah is \( S + (S + 12) = 30 \).
   - Simplifying, \( 2S + 12 = 30 \).
   - Solving for \( S \), \( 2S = 18 \), so \( S = 9 \).

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, and then convert that weight into pounds.

First, let's determine how many boxes Nik will need. Since he has 200 crayons and each box holds 8 crayons, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box:

200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is:

200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces

Now, we calculate the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the boxes is:

25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives us the total weight:

200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide the total weight in ounces by 16:

400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds.

"To determine how much John makes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the usable length of the tree for logs.
2. Determine how many 4-foot logs can be made from the usable length.
3. Calculate the total number of planks from the logs.
4. Compute the total revenue from selling the planks.

Step 1: Calculate the usable length of the tree.
The tree is 80 feet tall, and 80% of it can be used for logs.
Usable length = 80 feet * 80% = 80 feet * 0.8 = 64 feet

Step 2: Determine how many 4-foot logs can be made.
Number of 4-foot logs = Usable length / Length of each log = 64 feet / 4 feet = 16 logs

Step 3: Calculate the total number of planks.
Number of planks per log = 5
Total number of planks = Number of logs * Number of planks per log = 16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks

Step 4: Compute the total revenue from selling the planks.
Price per plank = $1.2
Total revenue = Total number of planks * Price per plank = 80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96

Therefore, John makes $96.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Grandma to walk the entire 3-mile trail, given the different speeds on the beach and the sidewalk.

First, let's find Grandma's speed on the beach. We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes. To find her speed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

For the beach:
\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

This means Grandma walks 1 mile in 20 minutes on the beach.

Next, we need to find her speed on the sidewalk. We know that she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is:

\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

This means Grandma walks 1 mile in 10 minutes on the sidewalk.

Now, we need to calculate the time it takes for her to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk:

\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:

\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many marbles Bob currently has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. Therefore, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles.

Let \( x \) represent the number of marbles Bob currently has. According to the problem, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. Now, if Bob loses 10 marbles, we need to subtract 10 from 36 to find out how many marbles he will have left:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

Donny mixes 4 ounces of 33-degree water with 1 ounce of \( T \)-degree water. The total volume of the mixed water is 5 ounces. The temperature of the mixed water can be calculated using the weighted average of the temperatures of the two waters:

\[
\text{Mixed Temperature} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{4 + 1}
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
\text{Mixed Temperature} = \frac{132 + T}{5}
\]

We know that the mixed temperature must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

To find \( T \), we solve the inequality:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the temperature of the water in the second mug must be at least 68 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the increase in the number of cows and chickens and then add these to the initial numbers.

First, let's calculate the increase in the number of cows:
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
- Over three weeks (21 days), the total number of cows added is 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.

Next, let's calculate the increase in the number of chickens:
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.
- Over three weeks (21 days), the total number of chickens added is 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.

Now, let's add these increases to the initial numbers:
- Initial number of cows: 50
- Initial number of chickens: 20

Total number of cows after three weeks: 50 + 420 = 470 cows
Total number of chickens after three weeks: 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

Finally, let's add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals on the farm:
470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

2. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.
3. Calculate the total cost after the discount.
4. Divide the total cost after the discount by the total number of bagels to find the cost per bagel.

Let's go through these steps:

1. The cost of one pack of bagels is $10.00. Therefore, the cost of 4 packs is:
   \[ 4 \times 10.00 = 40.00 \]

2. The 10% discount on $40.00 is:
   \[ 0.10 \times 40.00 = 4.00 \]

3. The total cost after the discount is:
   \[ 40.00 - 4.00 = 36.00 \]

4. Each pack contains 9 bagels, so 4 packs contain:
   \[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

5. The cost per bagel is:
   \[ \frac{36.00}{36} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per bagel after the discount is $1.00.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate:
Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops, which is:
23 - 5 = 18 scoops

Next, we need to figure out how many potatoes are needed to make the scoops of mashed potatoes. According to the problem, it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Let's simplify this:

3 less than 6 potatoes is:
6 - 3 = 3 potatoes

1 less than 3 scoops is:
3 - 1 = 2 scoops

So, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops. We can set up a proportion based on the information that 3 potatoes make 2 scoops:

3 potatoes / 2 scoops = x potatoes / 18 scoops

Cross-multiplying to solve for x gives us:
2x = 3 * 18
2x = 54
x = 54 / 2
x = 27

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

Number of red jellybeans = 2 * 17 = 34

Now, we know the total number of jellybeans is 60. We can find the number of blue jellybeans by subtracting the number of green and red jellybeans from the total:

Number of blue jellybeans = Total jellybeans - (Number of green jellybeans + Number of red jellybeans)
Number of blue jellybeans = 60 - (17 + 34)
Number of blue jellybeans = 60 - 51
Number of blue jellybeans = 9

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus before any women alight.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 14 passengers (5 men + 9 women), 5 are men and 9 are women.

Given that the total number of passengers is 84, we can find out how many groups of 14 passengers there are on the bus:
84 passengers / 14 passengers per group = 6 groups

Since there are 6 groups and each group has 9 women, the total number of women on the bus initially is:
6 groups * 9 women per group = 54 women

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
54 women - 20 women = 34 women

Therefore, the number of women who have remained on the bus is 34.

"To determine the total number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold and the number of sunflowers sold as part of bouquets, and then sum these amounts.

1. **Calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day:**
   - Faraday earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers at $2 each.
   - Number of individual sunflowers sold per day = $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers.

2. **Calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:**
   - Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets at $8 each.
   - Number of bouquets sold per day = $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets.

3. **Calculate the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day:**
   - Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
   - Number of sunflowers in bouquets sold per day = 7 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers.

4. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day:**
   - Total sunflowers sold per day = individual sunflowers + sunflowers in bouquets
   - Total sunflowers sold per day = 13 + 84 = 97 sunflowers.

5. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days:**

"To determine how much money Adam loses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many rocks Adam can buy with $100.
2. Determine how many rocks he sells, which is 60% of his inventory.
3. Calculate the revenue from selling the rocks.
4. Calculate the total cost of the rocks he bought.
5. Determine the loss by subtracting the revenue from the total cost.

Step 1: Calculate the number of rocks Adam can buy.
Adam has $100 and each rock costs $5.
\[ \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\$100}{\$5} = 20 \text{ rocks} \]

Step 2: Determine how many rocks he sells.
He sells 60% of his inventory.
\[ \text{Rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ rocks} \]

Step 3: Calculate the revenue from selling the rocks.
Each rock is sold for $7.
\[ \text{Revenue} = 12 \times \$7 = \$84 \]

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the rocks he bought.
\[ \text{Total cost} = 20 \times \$5 = \$100 \]

Step 5: Determine the loss.
\[ \text{Loss} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Revenue} = \$100 - \$84 = \$16 \]

Adam loses $16.

"To determine how many days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the time required for each type of picture scene and then sum these times.

1. **Large-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
   - Time required for large-sized scenes = 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days.

2. **Medium-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
   - Time required for medium-sized scenes = 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days.

3. **Small-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.
   - Time required for small-sized scenes = 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days.

"To find the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probability of winning with the first ticket by the probability of winning with the second ticket.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.20.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning with the second ticket is 3 times 0.20, which is 0.60.

Now, we multiply the probabilities of each event happening:

0.20 (probability of the first ticket winning) * 0.60 (probability of the second ticket winning) = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.12 * 100 = 12%

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

3. A 7-year-old avocado tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
4. A 10-year-old avocado tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.
5. An 8-year-old avocado tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one, which is 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
6. During the ninth year, the avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit, so it produces 0 fruits.

Now, we need to calculate the total production for the 10 years. We know the production for years 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10, and we know that the tree does not produce any fruit in the 9th year. For the first four years, we do not have specific information, so we will assume that the tree does not produce any fruit in those years, as the problem does not provide data for those years.

The total production is the sum of the fruits produced each year from year 5 to year 10:

Total fruits = 0 (year 1) + 0 (year 2) + 0 (year 3) + 0 (year 4) + 50 (year 5) + 150 (year 6) + 350 (year 7) + 800 (year 8) + 0 (year 9) + 1000 (year 10)

According to the problem, the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.

The combined length of the three ropes is given as 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 4B + B + B + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ B = 5 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much chalk is left after Monday and then determine how many days the teacher can use the remaining chalk before it is less than 2 inches, using 20% of the remaining chalk each day.

1. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
   - On Monday, he uses 45% of the chalk.
   - The amount of chalk used on Monday is \( 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \) inches.
   - The remaining chalk after Monday is \( 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \) inches.

2. **Determine how many days the teacher can use the remaining chalk:**
   - Each day, the teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk.
   - We need to find out how many days it takes for the remaining chalk to be less than 2 inches.

Let's calculate the remaining chalk each day:

- **Day 1 (Tuesday):**
  - Remaining chalk: \( 2.75 \times (1 - 0.20) = 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \) inches.

- **Day 2 (Wednesday):**
  - Remaining chalk: \( 2.20 \times (1 - 0.20) = 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \) inches.

After Wednesday, the remaining chalk is 1.76 inches, which is less than 2 inches. Therefore, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after Wednesday.

The teacher can use the chalk for 2 more days after Monday before he has to recycle it.

"To find out how many students are not on varsity, we first need to calculate how many boys and girls are on varsity and then subtract these numbers from the total number of boys and girls in the class.

There are 12 girls in the class, and one-third of them are on varsity:
1/3 * 12 girls = 4 girls on varsity

There are 12 boys in the class, and one-fourth of them are on varsity:
1/4 * 12 boys = 3 boys on varsity

Now, we add the number of boys and girls on varsity to get the total number of students on varsity:
4 girls + 3 boys = 7 students on varsity

The total number of students in the class is:
12 girls + 12 boys = 24 students

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:
24 students - 7 students on varsity = 17 students not on varsity

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we first need to determine the total number of teeth the dentist works on. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. This means the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped:
4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

James has 30 teeth in total. To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

"To calculate the refund Mr. Marcellus received, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount of milk that was expired and could not be sold.
2. Calculate the cost of the expired milk.
3. The cost of the expired milk is the amount Mr. Marcellus will receive as a refund.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of expired milk.
- Total milk purchased: 4000 gallons
- Fraction of milk that expired: 2/5

Expired milk = Total milk * Fraction expired
Expired milk = 4000 * (2/5)
Expired milk = 4000 * 0.4
Expired milk = 1600 gallons

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the expired milk.
- Cost per gallon: $3.5

Cost of expired milk = Expired milk * Cost per gallon
Cost of expired milk = 1600 * $3.5
Cost of expired milk = $5600

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600.

"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   \[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   \[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, let's expand the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5C + 35}{3} \]
Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]
Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to calculate the total number of books he can buy with $27000. 

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy:
   - Cost of 100 books = $500
   - Total money Bob has = $27000
   - Number of 100-book sets Bob can buy = $27000 / $500 = 54 sets
   - Total number of books = 54 sets * 100 books/set = 5400 books

2. Since the books are to be distributed equally among 3 schools:
   - Number of books per school = Total number of books / 3 = 5400 books / 3 = 1800 books

"Let's break down the sequence of events to determine how many apples Newton brought home:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up both apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other one into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall.
3. Now, Newton has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 apples on the ground.
4. Newton picked up the 5 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall.
5. Now, Newton has 1 (from the first step) + 4 (from the 5 apples, minus the one he threw) = 5 apples in his pocket, and 6 apples on the ground.
6. Newton picked up all 6 apples and put them in his pocket.

So, the total number of apples Newton brought home is 5 (already in his pocket) + 6 (picked up from the ground) = 11 apples.

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of slices her friends will consume.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

So, the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed by all friends is:
6 friends * 6 slices/friend = 36 slices

The total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed by all friends is:
6 friends * 4 slices/friend = 24 slices

Next, we calculate how many whole pizzas are needed for each type based on the number of slices per pizza:
- A cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- A pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.

For the cheese pizza:
36 slices / 12 slices/pizza = 3 cheese pizzas

For the pepperoni pizza:
24 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 3 pepperoni pizzas

Therefore, Kate needs to buy a total of:
3 cheese pizzas + 3 pepperoni pizzas = 6 pizzas

"To solve this problem, we need to consider both the rate at which Jay makes snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay makes 20 snowballs per hour, which is 5 snowballs every 15 minutes. However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Therefore, the net increase in the number of snowballs every 15 minutes is:

5 (made) - 2 (melted) = 3 snowballs

To find out how long it will take to have 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net increase per 15 minutes:

60 snowballs / 3 snowballs per 15 minutes = 20 intervals of 15 minutes

Since each interval is 15 minutes, the total time required is:

20 intervals * 15 minutes per interval = 300 minutes

Converting 300 minutes into hours:

300 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 5 hours

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Determine the year Digimon came out. Since the 20th anniversary has been celebrated, we can calculate the year it came out by subtracting 20 years from the current year. However, since the exact current year is not provided, we can work with the information given about John and Jim's ages.

2. We know that John is 28 years old now. If we assume the current year is the year of the 20th anniversary, then 20 years ago, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

3. According to the problem, 20 years ago, John was twice as old as Jim. If John was 8 years old, then Jim was 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

4. To find out how old Jim is now, we add 20 years to his age 20 years ago: 4 + 20 = 24 years old.

Therefore, Jim is 24 years old now.

"To determine how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day, we need to track the usage and orders over the three days and then work backwards from the final count of 78 bandages.

1. **First Day:**
   - Used: 38 bandages
   - Ordered: 1 bulk pack (50 bandages)
   - Net change: -38 + 50 = +12 bandages

2. **Second Day:**
   - Used: 38 - 10 = 28 bandages
   - Ordered: 0 bulk packs
   - Net change: -28 bandages

3. **Third Day:**
   - Used: 1/2 pack = 25 bandages
   - Ordered: 2 bulk packs (100 bandages)
   - Net change: -25 + 100 = +75 bandages

Now, let's calculate the total net change over the three days and work backwards from the 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

- Total net change over three days: +12 (first day) - 28 (second day) + 75 (third day) = +59 bandages

If they had 78 bandages at the end of the third day, and the total net change over the three days was +59 bandages, we can find the initial number of bandages by subtracting the net change from the final count:

- Initial bandages = 78 - 59 = 19

Therefore, the nurses started with 19 bandages on the first day.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider both her hourly wage and her attendance bonus.

First, we calculate her earnings from her hourly wage:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her weekly earnings from her hourly wage are:
7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * $1.5/hour = 67.5 hours/week * $1.5/hour = $101.25/week

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her monthly earnings from her hourly wage are:
$101.25/week * 4 weeks = $405

Next, we add her attendance bonus:
- Jen receives an additional $10 for each week of complete attendance.
- Since she did not incur any absences for the entire month, she receives the bonus for all 4 weeks.

So, her total attendance bonus for April is:
$10/week * 4 weeks = $40

Finally, we add her monthly earnings from her hourly wage and her attendance bonus to get her total earnings for April:
$405 + $40 = $445

Next, she bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens. Since there are 5 packs of red pens, she bought:
2 * 5 packs = 10 packs of black pens

Each pack of black pens also has 5 pens, so the total number of black pens is:
10 packs * 5 pens/pack = 50 black pens

Now, to find the total number of pens, we add the number of red pens and black pens together:
25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens

Therefore, Alain has 75 pens in total.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **First Day Planting:**
   - Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
   - He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

2. **Second Day Planting:**
   - He planted 10 more White Oak trees, so the total for White Oak on the second day is \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
   - He planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he did on the first day. The number of additional Lodgepole Pine trees is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \) trees.
   - Therefore, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is \(40 + 10 = 50\) trees.

3. **Total Trees Planted:**
   - Total White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\) trees.
   - Total Lodgepole Pine trees: \(40 + 50 = 90\) trees.

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 = 11 \times 9 = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the buying price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

So, Trinity's profit is $27.

"To determine the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Water removed = 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, so 2 * 1 liter/day = 2 liters/day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Water removed = 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.

3. **High Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting, so 2 * 2 liters/day = 4 liters/day.
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Water removed = 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Now, we sum the water removed at each setting:
- Total water removed = 3 liters (low) + 6 liters (medium) + 20 liters (high) = 29 liters.

56 mL * 8 = 448 mL

448 mL"
"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we first need to determine the capacity of the classes in each school.

Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students. Since John's classes each have 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

120 students / 8 = 15 students

John has two classes, so the total capacity for John's school is:

15 students/class * 2 classes = 30 students

Now, we add the capacity of Ali's school to the capacity of John's school to get the combined capacity:

120 students (Ali's school) + 30 students (John's school) = 150 students

The combined capacity of both schools is 150 students.

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to calculate the total number of jelly beans he estimated and then find out how many of those he thought were red. We can then compare this to the true number of red jelly beans, which is 900.

First, we calculate the volume of the jar:
\[ \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we calculate the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans, considering the 80% packing efficiency:
\[ \text{Effective volume} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Now, we determine the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar:
\[ \text{Total number of jelly beans} = \frac{\text{Effective volume}}{\text{Volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \]

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red:
\[ \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we calculate the difference:
\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

"To determine how much Pauline spent on all her visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost of visits before the price increase and the cost of visits after the price increase.

1. **Cost of visits before the price increase:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - The cost of one visit is $2.
   - She visits the museum for 5 years.
   - Total cost for 5 years = 3 visits/year * $2/visit * 5 years = $30.

2. **Cost of visits after the price increase:**
   - The cost of one visit increases by 150%.
   - 150% of $2 is 1.5 * $2 = $3.
   - The new cost of one visit is $2 + $3 = $5.
   - Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year for 3 more years.
   - Total cost for 3 years after the price increase = 3 visits/year * $5/visit * 3 years = $45.

3. **Total cost for all visits:**
   - Total cost = Cost before the price increase + Cost after the price increase
   - Total cost = $30 + $45 = $75.

Therefore, Pauline spent a total of $75 on all her visits to the museum.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece, which is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, is:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To determine how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning he will need, we first need to figure out how many pounds of ground beef he will use to make 80 meatballs.

Given that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can calculate the number of pounds needed for 80 meatballs as follows:

\[ \text{Number of pounds} = \frac{\text{Total meatballs}}{\text{Meatballs per pound}} = \frac{80}{16} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef, we can calculate the total amount of seasoning needed for 5 pounds of ground beef:

\[ \text{Total seasoning} = \text{Number of pounds} \times \text{Seasoning per pound} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning.

"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call with the given pricing structure, we need to break the call into two segments: the first 16 minutes and the remaining minutes after the price drops.

1. For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute:
   \( 16 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.25/\text{minute} = \$4.00 \)

2. For the remaining 20 minutes (36 minutes total - 16 minutes), the cost is $0.20 per minute:
   \( 20 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.20/\text{minute} = \$4.00 \)

3. Adding the costs of both segments together gives the total cost of the call:
   \( \$4.00 + \$4.00 = \$8.00 \)

The total cost of a 36-minute call is $8.00.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of treats needed:**
   - Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats.
   - Total treats needed = 5 people * 2 treats/person = 10 treats.

2. **Set up the relationship between the number of cupcakes and brownies:**
   - Let \( c \) be the number of cupcakes.
   - According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.
   - Therefore, the number of brownies \( b \) can be expressed as \( b = 3c - 2 \).

3. **Set up the equation for the total number of treats:**
   - The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and the number of brownies.
   - Total treats = \( c + b \).
   - We know the total treats needed is 10, so:
     \[
     c + (3c - 2) = 10
     \]

4. **Solve the equation:**
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     c + 3c - 2 = 10
     \]
     \[
     4c - 2 = 10
     \]
   - Add 2 to both sides:
     \[
     4c = 12
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 4:
     \[
     c = 3

"To calculate the total cost for Karen, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of a manicure and a pedicure with the 20% discount.
2. Calculate the cost of the nail art.
3. Add the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art.

First, let's find the combined cost of the manicure and pedicure before the discount:
- Manicure: $35
- Pedicure: $40
- Combined cost: $35 + $40 = $75

Now, apply the 20% discount to the combined cost:
- Discount: 20% of $75 = 0.20 * $75 = $15
- Discounted cost: $75 - $15 = $60

Next, calculate the cost of the nail art. Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, which means 10 nails in total:
- Cost per nail: $3
- Total cost for nail art: 10 * $3 = $30

Finally, add the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art:
- Total cost: $60 + $30 = $90

Therefore, Karen would pay $90 in all.

"To find out how many paintings Kim has, we can start by setting up the relationships described in the problem with the information given.

Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as \( K \).

According to the problem, Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, so we can express the number of paintings Shelley has as \( K + 8 \).

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and we know that Samantha has 27 paintings. So, we can express the number of paintings Samantha has as \( (K + 8) - 12 \).

Since we know Samantha has 27 paintings, we can set up the equation:

\[ (K + 8) - 12 = 27 \]

Now, let's solve for \( K \):

\[ K + 8 - 12 = 27 \]
\[ K - 4 = 27 \]
\[ K = 27 + 4 \]
\[ K = 31 \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings.

"To find the final price of the toy after the changes in December and January, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the price in December:**
   - The price in November was $40.
   - The price increased by 80% in December.
   - To find the increase, we calculate 80% of $40: \( 0.80 \times 40 = 32 \).
   - The new price in December is the original price plus the increase: \( 40 + 32 = 72 \).

2. **Determine the price in January:**
   - The price in December was $72.
   - The price decreased by 50% in January.
   - To find the decrease, we calculate 50% of $72: \( 0.50 \times 72 = 36 \).
   - The new price in January is the December price minus the decrease: \( 72 - 36 = 36 \).

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36.

"To find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we need to calculate the total distance he has traveled and then compare it to the total distance.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael has traveled in 3 days. Since he is traveling at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we need to know how many hours he travels in 3 days.

There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, there are:
3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance he has traveled:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours = 3600 km

Now, we need to find out what percentage of the total distance (6000 km) this is:
Percentage covered = (Distance traveled / Total distance) * 100
Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100 = 60%

So, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

$15.00 / 30 sticks = $0.50 per stick

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents by multiplying by 100:

$0.50 * 100 = 50 cents

Therefore, each stick of jerky costs 50 cents.

"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test to move on to the 7th grade, we need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly across both tests, and then see how many more she needs to reach that total.

First, let's calculate the total number of questions across both tests:
- The first test has 70 questions.
- The second test has 40 questions.
- Total questions = 70 + 40 = 110 questions.

Next, we calculate the number of questions she needs to answer correctly to pass, which is 70% of the total questions:
- 70% of 110 = 0.70 * 110 = 77 questions.

Now, let's see how many questions she got right on the first test:
- She got 60% of the 70 questions correct.
- 60% of 70 = 0.60 * 70 = 42 questions.

To find out how many more questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she already got right from the total number of questions she needs to get right:
- Questions needed to pass = 77
- Questions already correct = 42
- Questions needed on the second test = 77 - 42 = 35 questions.

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move on to the 7th grade.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which can be written as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combining like terms, we have:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6 to solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, we can find \( B \) by substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation \( B = 5S - 4 \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is 96.

"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using when the lights go out, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

1. **Flashlights:**
   - There is a flashlight for every person, and there are 4 people.
   - There are also 2 flashlights for each of the 8 rooms.
   - Total flashlights = Flashlights for people + Flashlights for rooms
   - Total flashlights = 4 (for people) + (2 * 8) (for rooms)
   - Total flashlights = 4 + 16 = 20

2. **Candles:**
   - There are 4 small candles for half the rooms and 5 medium candles for the other half.
   - Half of the 8 rooms is 4 rooms.
   - Total small candles = 4 candles/room * 4 rooms = 16 candles
   - Total medium candles = 5 candles/room * 4 rooms = 20 candles
   - Total candles = Total small candles + Total medium candles
   - Total candles = 16 + 20 = 36

3. **Total items (candles and flashlights):**
   - Total items = Total flashlights + Total candles
   - Total items = 20 + 36 = 56

"To solve this, let's break down the time John takes for each side of the Rubik's cube:

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first, so they each take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes.
- The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first, so they each take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

Since solving the fifth side completes the cube, we don't need to add time for a sixth side. Therefore, the total time to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

"To determine how long it will take Phineas Frog to return home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to cover the distance on land and in water separately, and then sum these times.

The total distance Phineas needs to travel is 200 yards. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, each half is:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ yards}}{2} = 100 \text{ yards} \]

On land, Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute. The time it takes to cover 100 yards on land is:

\[ \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

In water, Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute. The time it takes to cover 100 yards in water is:

\[ \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

The total time it takes for Phineas to return home is the sum of the time on land and the time in water:

\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Phineas to return home is:

"To find out how many pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
3. In the following 30 seconds, four times the initial amount pop, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so it's 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.
5. After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, let's add up all the kernels that popped:

20 (first 30 seconds) + 60 (second 30 seconds) + 80 (third 30 seconds) + 40 (fourth 30 seconds) + 10 (after heat) = 210

So, Garrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to eat.

"To determine how many pounds of feed are left after a week, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by the pigs in one day and then for one week.

1. Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day, so each pig eats:
   \( 4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day} \)

2. Dexter has five pigs, so the total daily feed consumption for all pigs is:
   \( 8 \text{ pounds/day/pig} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \)

3. To find the total feed consumption for one week (7 days), we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
   \( 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ pounds/week} \)

4. Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so the amount of feed left after a week is:
   \( 300 \text{ pounds} - 280 \text{ pounds} = 20 \text{ pounds} \)

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Street**: The truck starts with 5 children.
2. **Second Street**: Each of the 5 children is joined by another child, so the number of children doubles. This means there are now \(5 \times 2 = 10\) children.
3. **Third Street**: Each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more children. This means the number of children increases by \(10 \times 2 = 20\). So, the total number of children now is \(10 + 20 = 30\).
4. **Children Leaving**: The original 5 children give up and leave the group. Therefore, the number of children now following the truck is \(30 - 5 = 25\).

So, the final number of children following the truck is:

"To find out how much time Charisma has spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time spent on meditation:
- Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so that's 15 minutes * 2 = 30 minutes per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she meditates for 30 minutes * 7 days = 210 minutes.
- In 4 weeks, she will meditate for 210 minutes * 4 = 840 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on yoga:
- Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour, 5 days a week. 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes.
- In one week, she practices yoga for 60 minutes * 5 days = 300 minutes.
- In 4 weeks, she will practice yoga for 300 minutes * 4 = 1200 minutes.

Now, let's add the time spent on meditation and yoga:
- Total time spent = 840 minutes (meditation) + 1200 minutes (yoga) = 2040 minutes.

To convert the total time into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
- 2040 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 34 hours.

So, in 4 weeks, Charisma has spent 34 hours on meditation and yoga practice.

"To find the total number of sunflower seeds, we first need to calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower and then the number of seeds in a large sunflower.

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen equals 12, the small sunflower has:
3 dozen * 12 seeds/dozen = 36 seeds

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of the small sunflower's seeds:
50% of 36 seeds = 0.5 * 36 seeds = 18 seeds

So, the large sunflower has:
36 seeds + 18 seeds = 54 seeds

To find the total number of seeds in both the small and large sunflowers, we add the seeds together:
36 seeds + 54 seeds = 90 seeds

"First, let's calculate how much allowance Ryan has earned over 3 weeks. Since he earns $6 each week, we multiply $6 by 3:

\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

So, Ryan has $18.

Next, we calculate the cost of the ice cream cones. Ryan bought ice cream for himself and 3 friends, which is a total of 4 ice cream cones. Each ice cream cone costs $1.25, so we multiply $1.25 by 4:

\[ 1.25 \times 4 = 5 \]

So, the total cost for the ice cream cones is $5.

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from Ryan's total allowance to find out how much money he has left:

\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \]

Ryan has $13 left.

Finally, we need to determine how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining $13. Each movie ticket costs $6.50, so we divide $13 by $6.50:

- The number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges} \).

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- Difference = Number of oranges Ana peels - Number of oranges Jane peels
- Difference = 20 oranges - 15 oranges = 5 oranges

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"To find out how much Mark paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount and the cost of the mechanic's labor.

1. The original cost of the radiator is $400.
2. The discount is 80%, so the cost of the radiator after the discount is 20% of $400.
3. The cost of the radiator after the discount is $400 * 20% = $400 * 0.20 = $80.
4. The cost of the mechanic's labor is 3 hours * $50/hour = $150.
5. The total cost is the cost of the radiator plus the cost of the labor: $80 + $150 = $230.

Therefore, Mark paid $230 in total.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

We know two things:
1. The total number of animals (chickens and cows) is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

From this, we can write the following equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \) (each animal is either a chicken or a cow)
2. \( 2C + 4K = 70 \) (chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To solve for \( C \) and \( K \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we first need to calculate the total number of slices from the 7 pizzas. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza:

7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people, which is Henry and his 3 friends, making a total of 4 people:

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices/person

So, each person can have 14 slices.
