"To determine the total number of bolts needed for a robe, we need to calculate the amount of blue fiber and white fiber required and then sum them up.

1. The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. The amount of white fiber needed is half the amount of blue fiber. Therefore, the white fiber required is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ bolt}
   \]

3. Adding the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together gives:
   \[
   2 + 1 = 3 \text{ bolts}
   \]

Thus, the total number of bolts needed for the robe is 3.

"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value to find the profit.

First, let's find the new value of the house. The repairs increased the value by 150%. This means the new value is 250% of the original value (100% original value + 150% increase).

The original value of the house is $80,000. 

To find 250% of $80,000:
\[ 250\% \times 80,000 = 2.5 \times 80,000 = 200,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is $200,000.

Next, we calculate the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Purchase price} + \text{Repair cost} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{New value} - \text{Total cost} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, Josh's profit is:
\[ 70,000 \]"
"To find out how many total meters James runs a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. First, determine how many meters James runs in one session. Since he runs 3 sprints and each sprint is 60 meters, we multiply 3 sprints by 60 meters per sprint:
   \[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ meters per session} \]

2. Next, since he runs 3 times a week, we multiply the meters he runs per session by the number of sessions per week:
   \[ 180 \times 3 = 540 \text{ meters per week} \]

So, the total meters James runs a week is 540 meters.

"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken needs per day:
   Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day.

2. Calculate the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock per day:
   Total feed needed = Number of chickens × Feed per chicken per day
   Total feed needed = 20 chickens × 3 cups/chicken
   Total feed needed = 60 cups

3. Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:
   Morning feed = 15 cups
   Afternoon feed = 25 cups
   Total feed given = Morning feed + Afternoon feed
   Total feed given = 15 cups + 25 cups
   Total feed given = 40 cups

4. Calculate the amount of feed needed for the final meal:
   Feed needed for final meal = Total feed needed - Total feed given
   Feed needed for final meal = 60 cups - 40 cups
   Feed needed for final meal = 20 cups

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of 16 glasses, where every second glass is sold at a 60% discount.

1. The cost of the first glass is $5.
2. The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.
3. This pattern repeats for every pair of glasses.

Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, we can divide the total number of glasses by 2 to find the number of pairs:
\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

Each pair consists of one full-price glass and one discounted glass:
- Cost of one full-price glass: $5
- Cost of one discounted glass: $3

The total cost for one pair of glasses is:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Since there are 8 pairs, the total cost for 16 glasses is:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay:
\[ 64 \]

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. Therefore, Charleston has \(4 \times 20 = 80\) sheep.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Therefore, Toulouse has \(2 \times 80 = 160\) sheep.

Now, to find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together, we add the number of sheep in each city:

\[20 + 80 + 160 = 260\]

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

1. Calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the file.
2. Add the time taken for the Windows update.
3. Add the time to download the entire file again.

First, calculate 40% of the 200 GB file:
\[ 0.40 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 80 \text{ GB} \]

Next, calculate the time to download 80 GB at a rate of 2 GB/minute:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Add the 20 minutes for the Windows update:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, add the time to download the entire 200 GB file again:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Total time:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 160 \text{ minutes} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the distances John travels in each segment of his journey.

1. **Initial Trip:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles in this time.
   - For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - For the remaining 1.5 hours (since the total return trip is 4 hours and he has already spent 2.5 hours), he drives at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Covered on the Return Trip:**
   - Total distance = 0 miles (standstill) + 15 miles (30 mph) + 120 miles (80 mph) = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - John initially traveled 180 miles away from home.
   - He then traveled 135 miles back towards home.
   - Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

Therefore, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to consider both her regular pay and her overtime pay.

1. **Regular Pay**: Eliza earns $10 per hour for the first 40 hours.
   - Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

2. **Overtime Pay**: Eliza worked 5 hours of overtime (45 total hours - 40 regular hours).
   - Overtime rate = 1.2 * $10/hour = $12/hour
   - Overtime pay = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

3. **Total Earnings**: Add the regular pay and the overtime pay.
   - Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month**: The program had 60 downloads.
2. **Second Month**: The number of downloads was three times the first month, which is \(3 \times 60 = 180\) downloads.
3. **Third Month**: The number of downloads was reduced by 30% from the second month. First, calculate 30% of 180: \(0.30 \times 180 = 54\). Then, subtract this from 180 to find the number of downloads in the third month: \(180 - 54 = 126\).

Now, sum the downloads from all three months:
\[60 + 180 + 126 = 366\]

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit per year and see when the total profit exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: $90
2. **Annual Revenue**: 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5
3. **Annual Cost**: $3

**Net Annual Profit**:
\[ \text{Net Annual Profit} = \text{Annual Revenue} - \text{Annual Cost} \]
\[ \text{Net Annual Profit} = \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5 \]

**Total Profit After \( n \) Years**:
\[ \text{Total Profit} = \text{Net Annual Profit} \times n - \text{Initial Cost} \]
\[ \text{Total Profit} = 7.5n - 90 \]

We need to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that the total profit is greater than or equal to zero:
\[ 7.5n - 90 \geq 0 \]
\[ 7.5n \geq 90 \]
\[ n \geq \frac{90}{7.5} \]
\[ n \geq 12 \]

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there.
2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so the number of vacuum cleaners sold to the red house is 2.
3. After selling to the green and red houses, the number of vacuum cleaners left is \( x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).
4. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{x}{3} - 1 \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house.
5. After selling at the orange house, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so the equation for the remaining vacuum cleaners is:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \left( \frac{x}{3} - 1 \right) = 5
   \]
6. Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} = 6
   \]
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs Claire uses per day.
2. Determine the total number of days in 4 weeks.
3. Multiply the number of eggs per day by the number of days to get the total number of eggs.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Claire uses 3 eggs per day.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Step 3: The total number of eggs used in 4 weeks is:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Step 4: Convert 84 eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we first need to calculate the total time she should take to complete the 12-mile trail.

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given:
- Total Distance = 12 miles
- Desired Average Speed = 4 miles per hour

We can rearrange the formula to solve for Total Time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 2 hours hiking the first 6 miles. Therefore, the remaining time she has to complete the trail is:
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = \text{Total Time} - \text{Time Already Spent} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance she needs to cover is:
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = \text{Total Distance} - \text{Distance Already Covered} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the required speed for the remaining distance:
\[ \text{Required Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Thus, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"First, let's determine the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in it is:
\[ 10 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \]

Since 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, the remaining amount of orange drink is 9 liters. The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:
\[ 9 \times \frac{2}{3} = 6 \text{ liters} \]

Next, let's determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in it is:
\[ 15 \times \frac{3}{5} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the water from the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink:
\[ 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture is:
\[ 15 \text{ liters} \]

"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

Step 1: Total servings consumed in 60 days
Cynthia eats 1 serving per day, so in 60 days, she will consume:
1 serving/day * 60 days = 60 servings

Step 2: Number of cartons needed
Each carton contains 15 servings. To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total servings by the number of servings per carton:
60 servings / 15 servings/carton = 4 cartons

Step 3: Total cost
Each carton costs $4.00, so the total cost for 4 cartons is:
4 cartons * $4.00/carton = $16.00

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and their total age.

Let's denote Darrell's age by \( D \) and Allen's age by \( A \). According to the problem, the ratio of their ages is 7:11, which can be written as:
\[ \frac{D}{A} = \frac{7}{11} \]

This implies:
\[ D = \frac{7}{11}A \]

We also know that the sum of their ages is 162:
\[ D + A = 162 \]

Substituting \( D = \frac{7}{11}A \) into the equation \( D + A = 162 \):
\[ \frac{7}{11}A + A = 162 \]

To combine the terms, we need a common denominator:
\[ \frac{7A + 11A}{11} = 162 \]
\[ \frac{18A}{11} = 162 \]

Next, solve for \( A \):
\[ 18A = 162 \times 11 \]
\[ 18A = 1782 \]
\[ A = \frac{1782}{18} \]
\[ A = 99 \]

So, Allen's current age is 99. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[ 99 + 10 = 109 \]

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now is:

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:
\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% more than 4 points:
25% of 4 points = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored:
4 points + 1 point = 5 points

Adding the points from both periods:
4 points + 5 points = 9 points

Therefore, the total points Mike scored is:

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine the cost per yogurt.
3. Calculate the total cost for the number of yogurts he eats in 30 days.

Step 1: Total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats:
2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts

Step 2: Cost per yogurt
The yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00, so the cost per yogurt is:
$5.00 / 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt

Step 3: Total cost for 60 yogurts
The total cost for 60 yogurts is:
60 yogurts * $1.25/yogurt = $75.00

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his average speed. Speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time.

First, let's determine the total time John spends running each week:
- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs for half as much time as the first day, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.

So, the total time he spends running each week is:
3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day) = 6 hours.

Next, we know the total distance he runs each week is 60 miles.

Now, we can calculate his average speed:
Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds and then calculate the total distance she can travel in six hours, given the time spent running and walking.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping is half as fast as running.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Running distance = \( 6 \) miles/hour × \( 2 \) hours = \( 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Walking distance = \( 1.5 \) miles/hour × \( 4 \) hours = \( 6 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \( 12 \) miles + \( 6 \) miles = \( 18 \) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 18 miles.

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to calculate the total number of calories you can still consume without exceeding your daily calorie target. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume are:
2000 - 1800 = 200 calories

Next, we need to find out how many calories are in one gram of chips. The bag has 250 calories per serving and 5 servings, so the total number of calories in the bag is:
250 calories/serving * 5 servings = 1250 calories

The bag weighs 300 grams, so the number of calories per gram is:
1250 calories / 300 grams = 4.1667 calories/gram

Now, to find out how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining 200 calories, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per gram:
200 calories / 4.1667 calories/gram ≈ 48 grams

Therefore, you can eat approximately 48 grams of chips.

"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of making 20 candles.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of making 20 candles.**

- Charlie can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax.
- To make 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax (20 candles / 10 candles per pound = 2 pounds).
- The cost of 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00.
- Therefore, the cost for 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.**

- Charlie sells each candle for $2.00.
- The total revenue from selling 20 candles is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

**Step 3: Calculate the net profit.**

- Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
- Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00

"To find the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of articles written on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the number of articles written on Wednesday.
3. Determine the total number of articles written over the three days.
4. Calculate the total number of hours spent writing these articles.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of articles written on Tuesday.**

Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday. On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. 

First, find \( \frac{2}{5} \) of 5:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 2 \]

So, she wrote 2 more articles on Tuesday than on Monday:
\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of articles written on Wednesday.**

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

**Step 3: Determine the total number of articles written over the three days.**

Add the number of articles written on each day:
\[ 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of hours spent writing these articles.**

Each article takes 4 hours to research and write. Therefore, the total number of hours spent is:

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes. Let \( x \) represent the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased. After purchasing the package, she had \( 80 + x \) Post-it notes. She then used 220 Post-it notes at work, leaving her with 23 Post-it notes.

The equation representing this situation is:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is 163.

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he buys is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Therefore, the cost of each red tie is:

Cost per red tie = Cost per blue tie + 50% of cost per blue tie
Cost per red tie = $40 + 0.5 * $40
Cost per red tie = $40 + $20
Cost per red tie = $60

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
Total spent on red ties = 10 * $60
Total spent on red ties = $600

Finally, the total amount spent on all ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

Total spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
Total spent on ties = $200 + $600
Total spent on ties = $800

"To solve this problem, we first need to round the prices of each type of flower to the nearest dollar:

- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3
- Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2
- Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2

Next, we calculate the total revenue from each type of flower:

- Revenue from marigolds: 12 pots * $3 = $36
- Revenue from petunias: 9 pots * $2 = $18
- Revenue from begonias: 17 pots * $2 = $34

Finally, we add up the total revenue from all the flowers:

Total revenue = $36 + $18 + $34 = $88

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-leveled sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level. Given that each level has half the square footage of the level below it, and the top level (Level 4) has a square footage of 16, we can work our way down to the bottom level.

1. Level 4: 16 square feet
2. Level 3: \( 16 \times 2 = 32 \) square feet
3. Level 2: \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \) square feet
4. Level 1: \( 64 \times 2 = 128 \) square feet

Next, we sum the square footage of all levels:
\[ 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 \]

To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[ \frac{240}{4} = 60 \]

Thus, the average square footage of a level is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, determine how much water each girl received. Since each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water:
   \[
   \text{Water each girl received} = \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters}
   \]

2. Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they received together is:
   \[
   \text{Total water for two girls} = 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters}
   \]

3. The boy received 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy is:
   \[
   \text{Total water taken} = 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters}
   \]

4. The initial amount of water was 24 liters. Therefore, the amount of water left is:
   \[
   \text{Water left} = 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters}
   \]

So, the final amount of water left is:

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \). According to the problem, the team played a total of 22 games, so we have:

\[ W + L = 22 \]

We are also told that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which gives us the equation:

\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( L \):

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now, substituting \( L = 7 \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):

\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the salary increases she will receive over these years.

1. **Initial Monthly Salary**: $600
2. **Initial Annual Salary**: $600 * 12 = $7200

Since Sylvie has just completed 5 years of service, she will receive a 10% increase in her salary starting this year.

3. **First Year Increase (Year 6)**:
   - New Monthly Salary: $600 + (10% of $600) = $600 + $60 = $660
   - New Annual Salary: $660 * 12 = $7920

4. **Second Year Increase (Year 7)**:
   - New Monthly Salary: $660 + (10% of $660) = $660 + $66 = $726
   - New Annual Salary: $726 * 12 = $8712

5. **Third Year Increase (Year 8)**:
   - New Monthly Salary: $726 + (10% of $726) = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

"To determine how much Christina will spend on gift bags, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of guests who will actually attend the party.
2. Determine the total number of gift bags needed.
3. Calculate the total cost of the gift bags.

Step 1: Calculate the number of guests who will actually attend the party.
Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, 3/4 of the invited guests will attend. Christina invited 16 friends, so:
\[ \text{Number of attendees} = \frac{3}{4} \times 16 = 12 \]

Step 2: Determine the total number of gift bags needed.
Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per attending guest. Therefore:
\[ \text{Total gift bags needed} = 0.75 \times 12 = 9 \]

"To determine how many pounds of potato salad Ted needs to bring to the picnic, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad that both the adult and child dinosaurs will consume.

First, we calculate the amount of potato salad the adult dinosaurs will eat:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adult dinosaurs.

\[ 10 \, \text{lbs/adult} \times 20 \, \text{adults} = 200 \, \text{lbs} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of potato salad the child dinosaurs will eat:
- Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats 5 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 5 child dinosaurs.

\[ 5 \, \text{lbs/child} \times 5 \, \text{children} = 25 \, \text{lbs} \]

Now, we add the amounts of potato salad for the adults and the children to find the total amount needed:

\[ 200 \, \text{lbs} + 25 \, \text{lbs} = 225 \, \text{lbs} \]

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

"Let's denote the number of pets Cindy has as \( C \), Marcia has as \( M \), and Jan has as \( J \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Cindy has 4 pets, so \( C = 4 \).
2. Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, so \( M = C + 2 \).
3. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so \( J = 3M \).

First, calculate the number of pets Marcia has:
\[ M = C + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]

Next, calculate the number of pets Jan has:
\[ J = 3M = 3 \times 6 = 18 \]

Now, sum the total number of pets:

2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey: \( A = C - 2 \)
3. James is 1 year younger than Corey: \( 10 = C - 1 \)

First, solve for Corey's age using the third equation:
\[ C = 10 + 1 = 11 \]

Next, substitute Corey's age into the second equation to find Amy's age:
\[ A = 11 - 2 = 9 \]

Finally, substitute Amy's age into the first equation to find Jackson's age:
\[ 9 = J + 5 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Gerald's original time and then calculate his improved time after the 10% speed increase.

1. **Determine Gerald's original time:**
   - Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
   - Lee used to be 2 seconds faster than Gerald.
   - Therefore, Gerald's original time is \( 38 + 2 = 40 \) seconds.

2. **Calculate Gerald's improved time:**
   - Gerald's speed improved by 10%.
   - A 10% improvement in speed means he can run 10% faster, which translates to a 10% reduction in time.
   - To find the new time, we calculate 10% of 40 seconds and subtract it from 40 seconds.
   - 10% of 40 seconds is \( 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \) seconds.
   - Therefore, Gerald's improved time is \( 40 - 4 = 36 \) seconds.

Thus, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of dogs and cats:**
   - The number of dogs is given as 60.
   - Since there are two cats for every dog, the number of cats is \(2 \times 60 = 120\).

2. **Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:**
   - Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) = 180.

3. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   - The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.
   - Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168.

4. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   - Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
   - Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348.

Thus, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348.

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial volume of tomatoes before cooking.
2. Calculate how many cans of tomatoes were used.
3. Convert the number of cans into the number of tomatoes.

First, since the volume of the tomatoes is halved when cooked into sauce, the initial volume of tomatoes must have been twice the volume of the sauce. Freda made 32 ounces of sauce, so the initial volume of tomatoes was:
\[ 32 \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes were used to get 64 ounces of tomatoes:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is:

1. **Initial number of cars**: There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.
2. **Cars that took an exit**: 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.
3. **Remaining cars**: After 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars left is \(30 - 5 = 25\) cars.
4. **Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes**: 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.
5. **Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes**: Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \(x\).

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. This total should equal the number of cars that did not take the exit, which is 25 cars.

So, we have:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box, taking into account the thickness of the walls.

The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side) to get the inner dimensions.

Inner length = 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
Inner width = 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
Inner height = 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
Inner volume of one box = Inner length × Inner width × Inner height
Inner volume of one box = 3 inches × 4 inches × 2 inches = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
Total inner volume = Inner volume of one box × Number of boxes
Total inner volume = 24 cubic inches × 3 = 72 cubic inches

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \). This year, he intended to bake twice as many, which would be \( 2x \). However, he baked 15 more than he intended, so he baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies. After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. Therefore, before dropping the cookies, he had \( 110 + 5 = 115 \) cookies.

We can set up the equation:
\[ 2x + 15 = 115 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 2x + 15 = 115 \]
\[ 2x = 115 - 15 \]

"To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate on average, we first need to calculate the total area of the fruit roll-ups each of them had.

For Beatrice:
- The roll-up was 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- The total area for Beatrice is \(2 \times 24 = 48\) roll-ups.

For Marcell:
- The roll-up was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- The total area for Marcell is \(3 \times 14 = 42\) roll-ups.

Next, we add the total areas to find the combined total:
- Combined total = \(48 + 42 = 90\) roll-ups.

To find the average, we divide the combined total by the number of people (2):
- Average = \(90 \div 2 = 45\).

"To determine how much water Julia's boat took on by the time she reached shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Julia rowed to reach the shore.
2. Determine the rate at which water entered the boat.
3. Calculate the total amount of water that entered the boat based on the distance rowed.

First, we know that it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet. The shore was 64 seconds away, so we can calculate the total distance she rowed:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \left(\frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}}\right) \times 20 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that the boat took on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. We can calculate the total amount of water that entered the boat:

\[ \text{Total water} = \left(\frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 2 \text{ liters} = 8 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the total amount of water that the boat took on by the time Julia reached shore is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:**
   - Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   - Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
   - Therefore, Brittany's phone can hold \( \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \) photographs.

2. **Determine the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph:**
   - The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
   - Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.
   - Let \( d \) be the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
   - Therefore, \( 300 = 50d \).

3. **Solve for \( d \):**
   - \( d = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \).

So, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is 6.

"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue she will make from selling it at the new price.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:
- She has 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10, each costing $10.
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
  \]
- She has 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10, each costing $16.
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
  \]
- Total cost:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Next, let's calculate the selling price of each type of board after the 50% price increase:
- The new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15
  \]
- The new price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24
  \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the boards:
- Revenue from the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150
  \]
- Revenue from the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120
  \]
- Total revenue:
  \[
  \$150 + \$120 = \$270
  \]

Finally, let's calculate the profit:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = \$270 - \$180 = \$90

"To solve this problem, we first need to understand the ratio of sugar to water Katy uses, which is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total parts used in the mixture are 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Given that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 units, we can set up the following proportion to find out how many units correspond to the sugar:

\[
\frac{7}{20} = \frac{x}{120}
\]

Solving for \( x \) (the amount of sugar):

\[
x = \frac{7 \times 120}{20} = \frac{840}{20} = 42
\]

Therefore, Katy used 42 teaspoons of sugar.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of vehicles that were already at the port from the first day. According to the information, there were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles from the first day is:

2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles:

30 vehicles (total) - 10 vehicles (first day) = 20 vehicles (added on the second day)

Since each container holds 5 vehicles, we can determine the number of containers added on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:

20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

Thus, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4.

"First, let's determine Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary} = \text{Lylah's salary} + 0.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]

Given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, we can substitute this into the equation:

\[ 40000 = \text{Lylah's salary} + 0.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]
\[ 40000 = 1.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]

Solving for Lylah's salary:

\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = 30769.23 \]

Next, we calculate Adrien's salary four years later. Adrien's salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago:

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 56000 \]

Now, we need to find Lylah's new salary. Since their salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%:

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 12307.69 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 43076.92 \]

Finally, we add Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries to find the total salary they were receiving four years later:

\[ \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary} = 99076.92 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Monday**: Sadie slept 8 hours.
2. **Tuesday and Wednesday**: She slept 2 hours less each day than she did on Monday. So, for each of these days, she slept:
   \[
   8 - 2 = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]
   Therefore, for Tuesday and Wednesday combined, she slept:
   \[
   6 + 6 = 12 \text{ hours}
   \]
3. **Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday and Wednesday. So, for each of these days, she slept:
   \[

"To determine how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down her running into two segments based on her speed changes.

1. For the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour.
   - Distance covered in the first 3 hours: \(10 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}\).

2. After the first 3 hours, she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours (since 7 hours total - 3 hours already run = 4 hours).
   - Distance covered in the next 4 hours: \(5 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ miles}\).

3. Total distance covered in 7 hours:
   - Total distance = Distance in first 3 hours + Distance in next 4 hours
   - Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

10% of $10 = 0.10 * $10 = $1

The total cost of nonfood items including tax is:
$10 + $1 = $11

Finally, we add the total cost of food items and the total cost of nonfood items including tax:
$5 + $11 = $16

The total cost of everything is $16.

"To find out how much profit Kim will make each week, we need to calculate his total expenses and then subtract this from his total income.

First, let's determine the total number of clients:
- Current clients: 3
- Potential clients: 5
- Total clients: 3 + 5 = 8

Next, we calculate the total expenses for these 8 clients:
- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
- Cost of bleach per bottle: $2
- Cost of a pack of cloths: $5

Total cost of bleach for 8 clients:
- 8 clients * 2 bottles/client * $2/bottle = 8 * 2 * 2 = $32

Total cost of cloths for 8 clients:
- 8 clients * 1 pack/client * $5/pack = 8 * 5 = $40

Total expenses:
- Total cost of bleach + Total cost of cloths = $32 + $40 = $72

Now, we calculate the profit:
- Total income: $92
- Total expenses: $72
- Profit = Total income - Total expenses = $92 - $72 = $20

Therefore, Kim will make a profit of $20 each week.

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per harvest.
2. Determine how many harvests occur in a year.
3. Multiply the number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year.

Step 1: Total number of pineapples per harvest
- John has 10 hectares of land.
- Each hectare yields 100 pineapples.
- Therefore, the total number of pineapples per harvest is \(10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} = 1000 \text{ pineapples}\).

Step 2: Number of harvests in a year
- John can harvest every 3 months.
- There are 12 months in a year.
- Therefore, the number of harvests in a year is \(12 \text{ months/year} \div 3 \text{ months/harvest} = 4 \text{ harvests/year}\).

Step 3: Total number of pineapples harvested in a year
- Multiply the number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests in a year.
- \(1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year}\).

"To find out how many blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the total number of pieces from all the Lego sets he dumped on the floor.

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, which means it has \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first set, which means it has \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

Adding these together gives the total number of pieces Johnny picks up:
\[ 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information step by step:

1. In the first 6 hours, Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, she sees 1/2 that many bees return. 
   - 1/2 of 30 bees is 15 bees.
3. In the following 6 hours, she sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave.
   - Two times 30 bees is 60 bees.
4. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive.
   - Initially, 30 bees left and 15 returned, so 15 bees had not returned.
   - Then, 60 more bees left, so the total number of bees that left and had not returned is 15 (from the first group) + 60 (from the second group) = 75 bees.
   - Therefore, 75 bees return in the last 6 hours.

The number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is 75.

"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we first need to calculate the total cost of the tickets. The cost of one adult ticket is $12 and the cost of one child ticket is $10. Adding these together gives:

\[ 12 + 10 = 22 \]

This means the total cost for the tickets is $22. If Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we can determine how much she gave by adding the change to the total cost of the tickets:

\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

So, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30.

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, so Charlie has \( 3D \) friends.
- James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, so James has \( 4D \) friends.
- We are given that Charlie has 12 friends, so \( 3D = 12 \).

First, solve for \( D \):
\[ 3D = 12 \]
\[ D = \frac{12}{3} \]
\[ D = 4 \]

Now, we know Dorothy has 4 friends. To find out how many friends James has, we use the relationship \( 4D \):
\[ 4D = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends.

"To determine how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to get home:
- Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
- Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

The difference in their times is:
40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

Thus, the winner will be waiting for 4 minutes before the loser finishes the race.

"To find out how much Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost for inflating the tires of the bicycles, tricycles, and the unicycle.

1. Bicycles have 2 tires each. Since 5 people came by with bicycles and each tire costs 25 cents to inflate:
   - 5 bicycles * 2 tires/bicycle * 25 cents/tire = 250 cents

2. Tricycles have 3 tires each. Since 3 people came by with tricycles:
   - 3 tricycles * 3 tires/tricycle * 25 cents/tire = 225 cents

3. A unicycle has 1 tire. Since 1 person came by with a unicycle:
   - 1 unicycle * 1 tire/unicycle * 25 cents/tire = 25 cents

Adding these amounts together gives the total earnings in cents:
- 250 cents + 225 cents + 25 cents = 500 cents

Since 100 cents make a dollar, we convert the total earnings to dollars:
- 500 cents / 100 cents/dollar = 5 dollars

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it.

1. **Initial number of fries**: Let's call this number \( x \).

2. **Fries eaten by Dave**: Dave ate 14 fries.
   \[
   x - 14
   \]

3. **Fries eaten by the seagull**: The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is 7 fries.
   \[
   x - 14 - 7 = x - 21
   \]

4. **Fries eaten by the pigeons**: Each of the three pigeons ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of 9 fries.
   \[
   x - 21 - 9 = x - 30
   \]

5. **Fries stolen by the raccoon**: The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
   \[
   \text{Remaining fries before raccoon} = x - 30
   \]
   \[
   \text{Fries stolen by raccoon} = \frac{2}{3} (x - 30)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining fries after raccoon} = (x - 30) - \frac{2}{3} (x - 30) = \frac{1}{3} (x - 30)
   \]

6. **Fries carried off by ants**: The ants carried off 1 fry.
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[
\frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{1}{3} (x - 30) = 6

"To find out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends in class each week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- He has 3 classes each day, and each class is 1 hour long.
- Therefore, he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours each of these days.

Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total hours spent on these days is:
\[3 \times 3 = 9\] hours.

Next, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- He has 2 classes each day, and each class is 2 hours long.
- Therefore, he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours each of these days.

Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total hours spent on these days is:
\[2 \times 4 = 8\] hours.

Now, let's add the hours spent on all days of the week:
\[9 + 8 = 17\] hours per week.

Finally, to find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks in the semester:

"To find the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit, in this case, feet. 

1. **Convert the length of the rolls to feet:**
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so each roll is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls, so the total length of the rolls is \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.

2. **Convert the length of the croissants to feet:**
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Each croissant is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 120 croissants, so the total length of the croissants is \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.

3. **Length of the baguettes:**
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

4. **Add the lengths together:**
   - Total length = length of rolls + length of croissants + length of baguettes
   - Total length = 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can use the formula for exponential growth:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( P \) is the final price,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the rate of increase per period,
- \( n \) is the number of periods.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 20 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.20 \) (20% increase),
- The price increases every 2 months, so in 36 months, there are \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) periods.

Substituting the values into the formula:

\[ P = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18} \]
\[ P = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Calculating \( (1.20)^{18} \):

\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 38.3376 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P = 20 \times 38.3376 \]
\[ P \approx 766.752 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent:

\[ P \approx 766.75 \]

The cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months would be $766.75.

"Let's denote Seth's current age as \( S \) and Brooke's current age as \( B \). According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the equation:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \) and Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \). The problem states that the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the equation:
\[ (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( S = 2B \)
2. \( S + B = 24 \)

We can substitute \( S = 2B \) into the second equation:
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ S = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade.
2. Determine the total cost of making the lemonade.
3. Use the profit to find the total cost.
4. Calculate the cost of lemons based on the total cost.

First, let's find the total revenue. They made a profit of $25. Let's denote the total cost as \( C \). The profit is given by the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ 25 = \text{Total Revenue} - C \]
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 25 + C \]

Next, we need to determine the total cost. The cost to make one gallon of lemonade is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, which totals $5 per gallon. Let \( G \) be the number of gallons they made. The total cost is:
\[ C = 5G \]

The total revenue is the number of glasses sold times the price per glass. They get 20 glasses per gallon, so the total number of glasses sold is \( 20G \). The price per glass is $0.50, so the total revenue is:
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 0.50 \times 20G = 10G \]

Now we can set up the equation using the profit:
\[ 25 = 10G - 5G \]

"To determine how much money Zaid will have left after all his expenses and donations, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount spent on rent.
2. Calculate the amount spent on car fuel.
3. Determine the remaining amount after rent and car fuel.
4. Calculate the amount donated to charity.
5. Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount after the donation.
6. Find the final amount left.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. **Rent:**
   Zaid spends \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car Fuel:**
   Zaid spends \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car Fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Remaining Amount after Rent and Car Fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining Amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Donation to Charity:**
   Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Remaining Amount after Donation:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining Amount after Donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Amounts Given to Daughter and Wife:**
   Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars.
   \[
   \text{Total Given} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Final Amount Left:**
   \[
   \text{Final Amount Left} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the amount of money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations is:
\[
350

"To find out how much Lloyd earned for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week:
- He tutored for 5 hours.
- He earns $10 per hour.
- Therefore, his earnings for the first week are 5 hours * $10/hour = $50.

For the second week:
- He tutored for 8 hours.
- He earns $10 per hour.
- Therefore, his earnings for the second week are 8 hours * $10/hour = $80.

Adding the earnings from both weeks:
- Total earnings = $50 (first week) + $80 (second week) = $130.

Thus, Lloyd earned $130 for the first two weeks.

"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we first need to find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, and Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies.

Let \( c \) represent the number of white carnations. According to the problem:
\[ 5c = 200 \]

Solving for \( c \):
\[ c = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Next, we need to find out how many red roses she ordered. The problem states that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let \( r \) represent the number of red roses:
\[ r = 4c \]

Substituting the value of \( c \):
\[ r = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Sandra ordered 160 red roses. Since Fred has not delivered any of these red roses yet, he must deliver all 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"Let's denote the current ages of Jean, Mark, and Jan as \( J \), \( M \), and \( 30 \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Jean is two years older than Mark:
   \[
   J = M + 2
   \]

2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age:
   \[
   M - 2 = 5 + \frac{1}{2}(30 - 2)
   \]

First, simplify the equation for Mark's age two years ago:
\[
M - 2 = 5 + \frac{1}{2}(28)
\]
\[
M - 2 = 5 + 14
\]
\[
M - 2 = 19
\]
\[
M = 21
\]

Now, substitute \( M = 21 \) into the equation for Jean's age:
\[
J = M + 2
\]
\[
J = 21 + 2
\]
\[
J = 23
\]

Thus, Jean is 23 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then determine how much more likely one event is compared to the other.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   - The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - The probability \( P(\text{number} > 3) \) is:
     \[
     P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
     \]

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on one roll is:
     \[
     P(\text{even}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
     \]
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
     \[
     P(\text{two even numbers}) = P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
     \]

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5.
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25.
   - To find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3, we calculate the ratio of the probabilities and then convert it to a percentage:
     \[
     \text{Ratio} = \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
     \]
   - This means it is 2 times more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
   - Converting this to a percentage:
     \[
     2 \times 100\% = 200\%
     \]

Thus, it is 200% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total straw used for the hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = 10 cages * 5 pieces/cage = 50 pieces of straw.

2. **Determine the total straw used for the rabbits:**
   - There is a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed.
   - Total straw for rabbits = 20 pieces of straw.

3. **Calculate the total straw used for the rats:**
   - Total straw distributed = 160 pieces.
   - Straw used for hamsters = 50 pieces.
   - Straw used for rabbits = 20 pieces.
   - Straw used for rats = 160 pieces - 50 pieces - 20 pieces = 90 pieces.

4. **Determine the number of rats:**
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for rats = 90 pieces.
   - Number of rats = 90 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 15 rats.

5. **Determine the number of rats in each cage:**
   - There are 3 cages of rats.
   - Number of rats in each cage = 15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats/cage.

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is 5.

"To determine the number of bags the trader sold, let's break down the costs and profits involved.

1. **Cost of Purchase**: The trader buys each bag for $20.
2. **Transportation Cost**: It costs $2 to transport each bag.
3. **Total Cost per Bag**: The total cost for each bag is $20 (purchase) + $2 (transport) = $22.
4. **Selling Price per Bag**: The trader sells each bag for $30.
5. **Profit per Bag**: The profit made on each bag is $30 (selling price) - $22 (total cost) = $8.
6. **Total Profit**: The trader made a total profit of $400.

To find the number of bags sold, we use the total profit and the profit per bag:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total Profit}}{\text{Profit per Bag}} = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

Thus, the trader sold 50 bags.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates is 6 plates.
   - Total cost for 6 plates = 6 * $6000 = $36000.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Total cost of twenty dozen cups = $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

3. **Determine the cost per cup:**
   - Twenty dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups.
   - Cost per cup = Total cost of twenty dozen cups / Number of cups = $34800 / 240 = $145.

Thus, the total cost of buying each cup is $145.

"To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the jacket:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the additional amount she needs is:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so her total earnings from babysitting are:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Adding her babysitting earnings to her savings:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Sara still needs:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we divide the amount she needs by her earnings per lawn:
\[ 40 \div 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day and the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, and he has two more white chickens than red chickens. We can set up the following equations based on this information:

1. The total number of eggs collected each day:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

2. The relationship between the number of white and red chickens:
\[ w = r + 2 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( r \):

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substitute the perimeter and Gary's walking speed into the formula:

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park.

"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the first day: 100 customers.
2. Calculate the number of customers on the second day: 100 customers + 50 customers = 150 customers.
3. Let the number of customers on the third day be \( x \).
4. The total number of customers over the three days is given as 500. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   100 + 150 + x = 500
   \]
5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   250 + x = 500
   \]
6. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 500 - 250
   \]
   \[
   x = 250
   \]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 250.

"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. According to the problem, the pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the small pool was \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons, and the amount of water in the big pool was \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons.

We are given two conditions:
1. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
   \[
   B + 16 = 2(S + 16)
   \]
2. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
   \[
   B = 4S
   \]

First, let's solve the first equation:
\[
B + 16 = 2(S + 16)
\]
\[
B + 16 = 2S + 32
\]
\[
B = 2S + 16
\]

Now, substitute \( B = 4S \) from the second condition into the equation \( B = 2S + 16 \):
\[
4S = 2S + 16
\]
\[
2S = 16
\]
\[
S = 8
\]

So, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water.

"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase. The cost of the shoes is $320.00 and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00, given that she earns $8.00 per hour. We do this by dividing the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ 352.00 \div 8.00 = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth needs to pay back. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount.

The additional 10% of $2000 is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she needs to pay back is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount she will pay over 12 months if she pays $165 each month:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount she will pay from the total amount she needs to pay back:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Thus, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be:

"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we first need to determine the number of dahlias. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses and there are 4 roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, to find the total number of flowers in the vase, we add the number of roses and the number of dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

"Given that Harriet is 21 years old, we can start by determining the ages of Adrian and Zack.

1. Harriet's current age = 21 years.
2. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
   \]

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
1. Harriet's age in three years:
   \[
   21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years}
   \]
2. Adrian's age in three years:
   \[
   63 + 3 = 66 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Zack's age in three years:
   \[
   42 + 3 = 45 \text{ years}
   \]

Now, we find the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \text{ years}

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we first need to determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna based on the information given.

Naomi scored 68 points.

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi:
Half of Naomi's points is \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \).
So, Yuri scored \( 34 + 10 = 44 \) points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi:
So, Brianna scored \( 68 + 17 = 85 \) points.

Now, we can calculate the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\( 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \) points.

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find Jojo's score, we subtract the total points of the other three students from 251:
\( 251 - 197 = 54 \).

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points.

"First, we determine how much water is left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters. The tank initially had 120 liters, so:

120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters

This means 30 liters of water were left in the tank. Celine then collected rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank:

2 * 30 liters = 60 liters

Adding the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank:

30 liters + 60 liters = 90 liters

Therefore, the tank now has 90 liters of water.

"First, let's determine the total number of Pokemon cards James has initially:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20
- Water type: 40

Total initial cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

Next, we account for the changes:
- He loses 8 water type cards: 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards
- He buys 14 grass type cards: 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards

Now, let's calculate the new total number of cards:
- Fire type: 30

"First, calculate the total cost before the discount. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, and it takes 6 hours each day for 4 days a week. This is repeated for 5 weeks.

The cost per day is:
\[ 250 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours/day} = 1500 \text{ dollars/day} \]

The cost per week is:
\[ 1500 \text{ dollars/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 6000 \text{ dollars/week} \]

The total cost for 5 weeks is:
\[ 6000 \text{ dollars/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

After the movie is done, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. The discount amount is:
\[ 30000 \text{ dollars} \times 0.10 = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]

The final amount Jean pays is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cougars killed today:**
   - Rick killed 3 fewer cougars today than last night.
   - Last night, Rick killed 15 cougars.
   - Therefore, today Rick killed \( 15 - 3 = 12 \) cougars.

2. **Determine the number of wolves killed today:**
   - Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today.
   - Today, Rick killed 12 cougars.
   - Therefore, today Rick killed \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) wolves.

3. **Calculate the total number of animals killed today:**
   - Today, Rick killed 12 cougars and 36 wolves.
   - Total animals killed today = \( 12 + 36 = 48 \).

4. **Calculate the total number of animals killed last night:**
   - Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.
   - Total animals killed last night = \( 10 + 15 = 25 \).

5. **Calculate the total number of animals killed over both days:**
   - Total animals killed = Total animals killed last night + Total animals killed today
   - Total animals killed = \( 25 + 48 = 73 \).

Therefore, the total number of animals Rick killed is 73.

"To find the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
3. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight to find the remaining weight.

First, calculate the total weight of the redwood tree:
- The tree is 200 feet tall.
- Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.
- Therefore, the number of 10-foot sections in the tree is \( \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \).
- The total weight of the tree is \( 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \).

Next, calculate the weight of the wood that the termites ate:
- The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood.
- 30% of 8000 pounds is \( 0.30 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 2400 \text{ pounds} \).

Finally, subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight:
- The remaining weight of the tree is \( 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds} \).

The final weight of the redwood tree is 5600 pounds.

"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \) and the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \). According to the problem, Andrea has 52 apples, which is 8 more than Jamal's apples. Therefore, we can write:
\[ J_a + 8 = 52 \]
Solving for \( J_a \):
\[ J_a = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

Next, we know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples:
\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]
Substituting \( J_a = 44 \):
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal:
\[ A_b = \frac{J_b}{2} \]
Substituting \( J_b = 48 \):
\[ A_b = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of fruits. The total number of fruits is the sum of Andrea's apples, Andrea's bananas, Jamal's apples, and Jamal's bananas:

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we first calculate the amount needed for each day and then sum these amounts.

1. Calculate the flour needed for 36 cookies:
   - Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies, we can find the amount needed for 36 cookies by setting up a proportion:
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{36 \text{ cookies}}
   \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 36 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = 6 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. Calculate the flour needed for 30 cookies:
   - Similarly, for 30 cookies:
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{y \text{ cups}}{30 \text{ cookies}}
   \]
   - Solving for \( y \):
   \[
   y = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 30 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = 5 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. Add the amounts of flour needed for both days:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of spots on a mamba. Since a cobra has 70 spots and this is twice the number of spots on a mamba, we can find the number of spots on a mamba by dividing the number of spots on a cobra by 2:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, and 60 mambas, each with 35 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots on cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]
\[ \text{Total spots on mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of spots:

\[ \text{Total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots:

\[ \text{Half the total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

"To determine how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we first need to calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones and then find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads.

1. **Calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones:**
   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
   - Total length of topaz gemstones = \( 8 \times 1 \) inch = 8 inches.

2. **Determine the remaining length for the sterling silver beads:**
   - The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
   - Length occupied by topaz gemstones is 8 inches.
   - Remaining length for sterling silver beads = \( 25 - 8 \) inches = 17 inches.

3. **Calculate the number of sterling silver beads:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long.
   - Number of sterling silver beads = \( \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{0.25 \text{ inches per bead}} \) = 68 beads.

Thus, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. In the second week, they each doubled their output:

- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

To find the total number of stories written over the two weeks, we add the stories from both weeks:

- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories

Adding these totals together gives us the overall total:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has before buying the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. 
- Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 5 quarters are worth \(5 \times 25 = 125\) cents.
- Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 2 dimes are worth \(2 \times 10 = 20\) cents.

Adding these together, Kelly has \(125 + 20 = 145\) cents.

Next, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money Kelly has.
- The can of pop costs 55 cents.

So, the amount of money Kelly will have left is \(145 - 55 = 90\) cents.

"To find the number of 5-star rows, we first calculate the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows. 

There are three rows of 8 stars each:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ stars} \]

There are two rows of 6 stars each:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ stars} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ stars} \]

The flag has 76 stars in total. Subtracting the stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total gives the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \text{ stars} \]

Each 5-star row contains 5 stars. To find the number of 5-star rows, divide the number of remaining stars by 5:
\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ rows} \]

Thus, there are 8 rows of 5 stars.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed. Therefore, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:

\[ \text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for the car in the slow lane to cover 480 miles. We use the formula for time, which is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance.

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \). According to the problem, the number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the offense has \( 2D \) players. The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the special teams have \( \frac{D}{2} \) players.

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = V \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 120 \times 0.1 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Number of Boys**: The problem states that there are 30 boys in the classroom.
   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = 30
   \]

2. **Number of Girls**: The problem states that there are 3 times as many girls as boys.
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times \text{Number of boys} = 3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

3. **Number of Nongendered Children**: The problem states that there are \(\frac{1}{10}\) as many nongendered children as boys.
   \[
   \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times \text{Number of boys} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

4. **Total Number of Children**: To find the total number of children, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children.
   \[
   \text{Total number of children} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of nongendered children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123
   \]

Thus, the total number of children in the classroom is:
\[

"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, this means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires. If the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up the proportion as follows:

1 pole / 3 wires = x poles / 45 wires

To find the number of poles (x), we solve for x:

x = (1 pole / 3 wires) * 45 wires
x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial number of people:**
   - Men: 25
   - Women: 15
   - Total: 25 + 15 = 40

2. **Number of people who left:**
   - 1/4 of the total number of people left.
   - 1/4 of 40 = 40 / 4 = 10 people left.

3. **Number of people remaining:**
   - Total remaining: 40 - 10 = 30 people

4. **Number of men remaining:**
   - 22 men stayed at the party.

5. **Number of women remaining:**
   - Total remaining people: 30
   - Men remaining: 22
   - Women remaining: 30 - 22 = 8

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. We know that Jam has three boxes and 2 loose pencils, totaling 26 pencils. 

Let's denote the number of pencils in each of Jam's boxes as \( x \). Therefore, the equation for the total number of pencils Jam has is:
\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 3x = 24 \]

Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 8 \]

So, each of Jam's boxes contains 8 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes are required to store all the pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils is:
\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we need to determine how many boxes are required to store 72 pencils. We do this by dividing the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:
\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon’s iced coffee is, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the added cream.

1. **Cooling by Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we calculate the number of ice cubes needed:
     \[
     \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Weakening by Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Weakening by Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"To determine how many old records the 5 people brought in, we need to understand the exchange rate and the total number of new records received. According to the problem, the exchange rate is 2 old records for 1 new record. 

Given that 5 people left with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records they brought in by using the exchange rate:

\[ \text{Number of old records} = 2 \times \text{Number of new records} \]

Substituting the number of new records:

\[ \text{Number of old records} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Thus, the 5 people brought in 14 old records.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of junior and senior programmers and their respective salaries, and then calculate the total monthly payroll for all programmers.

1. **Determine the number of junior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees.
   - Number of junior programmers = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \).

2. **Determine the number of senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of senior programmers = Total employees - Number of junior programmers.
   - Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60.

3. **Determine the salary of senior programmers:**
   - Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month.
   - Each senior programmer is paid $400 more than each junior programmer.
   - Salary of each senior programmer = $2000 + $400 = $2400.

4. **Calculate the total monthly payroll for junior programmers:**
   - Total payroll for junior programmers = Number of junior programmers × Salary of each junior programmer.
   - Total payroll for junior programmers = 40 × $2000 = $80,000.

5. **Calculate the total monthly payroll for senior programmers:**
   - Total payroll for senior programmers = Number of senior programmers × Salary of each senior programmer.
   - Total payroll for senior programmers = 60 × $2400 = $144,000.

6. **Calculate the total monthly payroll for all programmers:**
   - Total payroll for all programmers = Total payroll for junior programmers + Total payroll for senior programmers.
   - Total payroll for all programmers = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $224,000.

"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got in. Therefore, the number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

We know that there were 20 people heading to the third stop, so we set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

Thus, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

\[ \text{Rewards earned} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

This means the customer has $4 off to use on their next purchase. 

On this shopping trip, they spent $43. They used their $4 reward, and the coupon they applied took twice the amount of the reward off the price. 

\[ \text{Coupon discount} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total discount applied:

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( c \) represent the number of cows and \( h \) represent the number of chickens. According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60, and there are twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

1. \( c + h = 60 \)
2. \( h = 2c \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( c \):

\[ c + 2c = 60 \]
\[ 3c = 60 \]
\[ c = 20 \]

Now that we know there are 20 cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ h = 2c = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

"To find out how much money Marisa puts in her piggy bank over 5 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Marisa receives in 5 days.
2. Calculate the total amount of money Marisa spends on lollipops in 5 days.
3. Subtract the total amount spent on lollipops from the total amount received to find the total amount saved.

Step 1: Total amount received in 5 days
Marisa receives $5 each day. Over 5 days, she receives:
\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 5 \text{ dollars/day} = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 2: Total amount spent on lollipops in 5 days
Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and Marisa buys 4 lollipops each day. The cost per day is:
\[ 4 \text{ lollipops/day} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 1 \text{ dollar/day} \]
Over 5 days, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ dollar/day} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 3: Total amount saved
Subtract the total amount spent on lollipops from the total amount received:
\[ 25 \text{ dollars} - 5 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank over 5 days is:

"First, let's determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since each gumball costs $0.05 and he bought 40 gumballs, the total cost for the gumballs is:
\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

This $2 is half of the change he had after buying the candy. Therefore, the total change he had after buying the candy is:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Billy started with $10, the amount he spent on candy is:
\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of candy is $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy he bought, we divide the amount spent on candy by the cost per pound:
\[ \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

"Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( x \). According to the problem, \( x = 3 \).

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is given by \( 4x - 5 \). Substituting \( x = 3 \) into this expression, we get:
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of shoplifters:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we know the total number of people kicked out is 50. We can set up the equation to find the number of people kicked out for other reasons:
\[ x + (4x - 5) + 3(4x - 5) + \text{other reasons} = 50 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 3 + 7 + 21 + \text{other reasons} = 50 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 31 + \text{other reasons} = 50 \]

Solving for the number of people kicked out for other reasons:
\[ \text{other reasons} = 50 - 31 = 19 \]

Thus, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:

"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( E \) represent the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points. According to the problem, after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times as many points as Sara, who has 8 points.

First, we express Erin's total points after scoring 14 points:
\[ E + 14 \]

We know that this total is three times Sara's points:
\[ E + 14 = 3 \times 8 \]

Simplify the right side of the equation:
\[ E + 14 = 24 \]

Next, solve for \( E \) by subtracting 14 from both sides:
\[ E = 24 - 14 \]
\[ E = 10 \]

"To determine the monthly payment Karan has to make, we first need to calculate the total interest she will pay over the five months. The interest rate is 10% per year, so for five months, the interest rate is:

\[ \text{Interest rate for 5 months} = \frac{10\%}{12} \times 5 = \frac{10}{120} \times 5 = \frac{50}{120} = \frac{5}{12} \approx 0.4167\% \]

Next, we calculate the total interest on the principal amount of $3,650:

\[ \text{Total interest} = 3650 \times 0.004167 \approx 15.22 \]

The total amount to be repaid is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 15.22 = 3665.22 \]

Since Karan has to pay this amount in equal monthly installments over five months, the monthly payment is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many popsicles each person has based on the given ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. Together, they have 5 + 6 = 11 parts of the total number of popsicles.

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find out how many popsicles each part represents by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \text{Number of popsicles per part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find out how many popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

"To determine how much money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to streaming services, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services and then compare it to the cost of the cable package.

1. **Cost of Netflix:**
   - Netflix costs $10 per month.

2. **Cost of Hulu and Disney Plus with the bundle discount:**
   - Normally, each service costs $10 per month.
   - The total cost for both services without the discount is $10 + $10 = $20 per month.
   - With a 20% discount, the savings on the bundle is 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4.
   - Therefore, the cost of the bundle is $20 - $4 = $16 per month.

3. **Total cost of streaming services:**
   - The total cost for Netflix, Hulu, and Disney Plus is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus bundle) = $26 per month.

4. **Savings by cancelling the cable package:**
   - The cost of the cable package is $60 per month.
   - The cost of the streaming services is $26 per month.

"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of Valentine's cards Erica initially had:
   - She made 20 cards.
   - Her dad brought 2 boxes of 15 cards each, so 2 * 15 = 30 cards.
   - Total initial cards: 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

2. Calculate the total number of cards she passed out:
   - She passed out 24 to her classmates and 5 to her family.
   - Total passed out: 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

3. Calculate the total number of cards she received:
   - She received 17 cards from family and friends.

4. Calculate the final number of cards Erica has:
   - Initial cards: 50
   - Minus cards passed out: 50 - 29 = 21 cards.
   - Plus cards received: 21 + 17 = 38 cards.

"First, let's determine how many slices Bill and Mark each receive.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices:
\[ \text{Slices given to Bill} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Next, she gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark:
\[ \text{Slices given to Mark} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's add up the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ \text{Total slices given to Bill and Mark} = 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices herself. So, the total number of slices eaten or given away is:
\[ \text{Total slices eaten or given away} = 7 + 2 = 9 \text{ slices} \]

Finally, to find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total slices eaten or given away from the total number of slices:
\[ \text{Slices left} = 12 - 9 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

"To determine how many kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days by reducing the time he uses the air conditioner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily energy usage of the air conditioner:
   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour.
   - Mel uses it for 8 hours a day.
   - Daily energy usage = 900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watts/day.

2. Convert the daily energy usage to kilowatts:
   - 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts.
   - Daily energy usage in kilowatts = 7200 watts/day / 1000 = 7.2 kilowatts/day.

3. Calculate the reduced daily energy usage:
   - Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day.
   - New usage time = 8 hours - 5 hours = 3 hours/day.
   - Reduced daily energy usage = 900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watts/day.
   - Reduced daily energy usage in kilowatts = 2700 watts/day / 1000 = 2.7 kilowatts/day.

4. Calculate the daily energy savings:
   - Daily energy savings = Original daily energy usage - Reduced daily energy usage.
   - Daily energy savings = 7.2 kilowatts/day - 2.7 kilowatts/day = 4.5 kilowatts/day.

5. Calculate the total energy savings over 30 days:
   - Total energy savings = Daily energy savings * 30 days.
   - Total energy savings = 4.5 kilowatts/day * 30 days = 135 kilowatts.

"To determine how much Tyson will spend on meat and cheese, we first need to calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required to serve 20 people.

1. Each sandwich serves 4 people, so for 20 people, Tyson needs:
   \[
   \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches}
   \]

2. Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches, Tyson needs:
   \[
   5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of meat per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat}
   \]
   \[
   5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of cheese per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of cheese}
   \]

3. The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so for 5 pounds:
   \[
   5 \text{ pounds} \times 7 \text{ dollars per pound} = 35 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so for 5 pounds:
   \[
   5 \text{ pounds} \times 3 \text{ dollars per pound} = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. The total cost for the meat and cheese is:
   \[
   35 \text{ dollars} + 15 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Tyson would spend $50 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

"First, let's determine the initial number of corns and cannolis Allan has.

1. Allan has 40 cannolis.
2. There is twice as much corn as cannolis, so the number of corns is \(2 \times 40 = 80\).

Next, we account for the additional items Allan bought:

3. Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).
4. He also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he now has, so the number of corns he bought is \(100 - 40 = 60\).

Now, we add the new corns to the initial number of corns:

5. The new total number of corns is \(80 + 60 = 140\).

Finally, we find the combined total of corns and cannolis:

6. The combined total is \(140 + 100 = 240\).

"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, let's break down the information given:

1. Elliott aims to walk 10,000 steps a day.
2. He completed half of his steps (10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps) on his walks to and from school.
3. He did another 1,000 steps on a short walk with his friend.
4. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal.

First, let's calculate the total number of steps Elliott had taken before his jog:
- Steps to and from school: 5,000
- Steps with his friend: 1,000
- Total before the jog: 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps

Since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, we can determine the total number of steps he had taken by the end of his jog:
- Total steps taken by the end of the jog: 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps

Now, to find out how many steps he took during his jog, we subtract the steps he had taken before the jog from the total steps taken by the end of the jog:
- Steps during the jog: 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps

"To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to calculate the payments for each month and then sum them up.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**
- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per week: 40
- Weeks in a month: 4 (assuming a standard 4-week month for simplicity)

Total payment for one employee in May:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Total payment for all employees in May:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 40 \, \text{employees} = 96000 \, \text{dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total payment for June.**
- Number of employees in June: 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 3/4 of the employees remained.
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \, \text{employees} \]

Total payment for one employee in June:
\[ 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 2400 \, \text{dollars} \]

Total payment for all employees in June:
\[ 2400 \, \text{dollars/employee} \times 30 \, \text{employees} = 72000 \, \text{dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for both months.**

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means the first pound costs $3, and the second pound costs half of $3, which is $1.50.

The total cost for the taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells:
\[ 1.50 \]

Then, let's calculate the cost of the magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25, and she bought 4 magnets:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ 4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00 \]

Sally started with $10. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from $10:

Next, he gets a 20% discount on these two packages. The discount amount is:

\[ 1200 \times 0.20 = 240 \]

So, the cost after the discount is:

\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Additionally, Tim buys a finale firework that costs $150. Adding this to the discounted total:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of candles that explode:**
   - Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of the candles will explode.
   - If she makes 50,000 candles, the number of candles that will explode is:
     \[
     0.01 \times 50,000 = 500
     \]

2. **Determine the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog:**
   - 5% of the more dangerous candles (those that explode) also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.
   - Therefore, 5% of the 500 exploding candles will smell like wet dog:

1. Calculate the discount amount per blouse:
   - The regular price of each blouse is $20.
   - The discount is 30%, so the discount amount per blouse is 30% of $20.
   - \( 30\% \times 20 = 0.30 \times 20 = 6 \) dollars.

2. Calculate the discounted price per blouse:
   - The discounted price per blouse is the regular price minus the discount amount.
   - \( 20 - 6 = 14 \) dollars.

3. Calculate the total cost for 4 blouses:
   - The total cost is the discounted price per blouse multiplied by the number of blouses.
   - \( 14 \times 4 = 56 \) dollars.

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Let \( x \) be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.
4. Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
5. Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
6. Joanne's sister does not gather any apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[
30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
150 + x = 500

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of camels as \( c \) and the number of dromedaries as \( d \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 180.
2. The total number of humps is 304.

We can write these as:
\[ c + d = 180 \]
\[ 2c + d = 304 \]

We can solve this system of equations step by step. First, we can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( d \):
\[ (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2c + d - c - d = 124 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Now that we have \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[ 124 + d = 180 \]
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is 56.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars, came from the tattered jeans.

4. **Determine the original prices of the jeans:**
   - Let \( T \) be the original price of the tattered jeans.
   - Let \( J \) be the original price of the jogger jeans.
   - The tattered jeans were bought for $28, so the savings from the tattered jeans is \( T - 28 = 4 \).
   - Solving for \( T \), we get \( T = 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The jogger jeans were bought for $22, so the savings from the jogger jeans is \( J - 22 = 2 \).
   - Solving for \( J \), we get \( J = 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:**
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 more than the tattered jeans.

6 minibusses * 30 employees per minibus = 180 employees

Then, calculate the capacity of the minivans:
10 minivans * 15 employees per minivan = 150 employees

Now, add all the capacities together:
240 employees (buses) + 180 employees (minibusses) + 150 employees (minivans) = 570 employees

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570.

"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted by both the homemade and store-bought bird feeders.

1. **Homemade Bird Feeders:**
   - Lillian builds 3 homemade bird feeders.
   - Each homemade bird feeder attracts 20 birds plus an additional 10 birds.
   - Therefore, each homemade bird feeder attracts \(20 + 10 = 30\) birds.
   - Total birds attracted by homemade feeders: \(3 \times 30 = 90\) birds.

2. **Store-Bought Bird Feeders:**
   - Lillian buys 3 store-bought bird feeders.
   - Each store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds.
   - Total birds attracted by store-bought feeders: \(3 \times 20 = 60\) birds.

3. **Total Birds:**
   - Total birds attracted by all feeders: \(90 + 60 = 150\) birds.

Thus, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

"To find out how much Aleksandra paid for her dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the bagel is given as $4.
2. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find the cost of the soup:
   - 25% of $4 is \(0.25 \times 4 = 1\).
   - Therefore, the cost of the soup is \(4 + 1 = 5\) dollars.
3. The cake costs half the price of the bagel:
   - Half of $4 is \(4 \div 2 = 2\) dollars.

Now, we add up the costs of all the items:
- Bagel: $4
- Soup: $5
- Cake: $2

Total cost: \(4 + 5 + 2 = 11\) dollars.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 left over after buying the ticket. Therefore, he must have made a total of:
   \[
   100 + 50 = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Each card is sold for $1.5. To find out how many cards he sold, we divide the total amount of money he made by the price per card:
   \[
   \frac{150}{1.5} = 100 \text{ cards}
   \]

3. Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells the rest. If he sold 100 cards, these 100 cards represent 2/3 of his total collection (since he keeps 1/3 and sells 2/3). Let \( x \) be the total number of cards he started with. Then:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}x = 100
   \]

4. To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   x = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150
   \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is 18 guests.
   - Therefore, he prepared 18 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 36 hotdogs for the second hotdogs.
   - Additionally, he prepared 36 - 18 = 18 hotdogs for the remaining guests who would have one hotdog each.
   - Total hotdogs prepared = 36 (for second hotdogs) + 18 (for one hotdog each) = 54 hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Total hotdogs needed = 40 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 80 hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only had 54 hotdogs.
   - The number of hotdogs short = 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest wanted a second hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is equal to the number of hotdogs short.
   - Therefore, 26 guests did not get a second hotdog.

"To find the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names, we first need to determine the number of letters in her sister's name.

Indras has 6 letters. Half of the letters in Indras' name is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \). Her sister's name has 4 more letters than this, so:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, we add the number of letters in both names:
\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pots and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 utensils cost $5.00 each, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Adding these together, the total cost before the discount is:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Now, let's apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. 

To find 80% of $165.00, we calculate:
$165.00 * 0.80 = $132.00.

So, the total cost of her order after the discount is $132.00.

132.00"
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy. The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. Adding these together:

\[ 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 \]

The total cost of the items is $19.

Next, we calculate how much money Dora has. She has saved $2 from her allowance and her mother gave her $16. Adding these together:

\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]

Dora has $18.

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount of money she has from the total cost of the items:

\[ 19 - 18 = 1 \]

Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

2. Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus:
   \[
   \text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]
3. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur:
   \[
   \text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150
   \]
4. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter:
   \[
   \text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many gallons of gas are in one container.
2. Calculate how many gallons 1/4 of a container is.
3. Convert the gallons to pints.

First, we divide the total gallons of gas by the number of containers:
15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Next, we find out how many gallons 1/4 of a container is:
3 gallons * 1/4 = 0.75 gallons

Finally, we convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon:
0.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints

So, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount George spent:**
   - George had 1% of his money left, which means he spent 99% of his money.
   - If George spent $5, then 99% of his money is $5.
   - Let \( x \) be the total amount of money George had initially.
   - Therefore, \( 0.99x = 5 \).

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = \frac{5}{0.99} \approx 5.0505
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount George had initially:**
   - George had approximately $5.05 initially.

4. **Determine the amount George spent on chips:**
   - George bought 3 bags of chips, and each bag costs 40 cents.
   - Total cost of chips = \( 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the remaining amount spent on candy bars:**
   - Total amount spent = $5.
   - Amount spent on chips = $1.20.
   - Amount spent on candy bars = \( 5 - 1.20 = 3.80 \) dollars.

6. **Determine the number of candy bars George bought:**
   - Each candy bar costs 75 cents.
   - Number of candy bars = \( \frac{3.80}{0.75} \).

7. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \frac{3.80}{0.75} \approx 5.0667
   \]

Since George cannot buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

"To find the cost per serving, we first need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and then divide that by the number of servings.

1. Calculate the total cost of onions:
   - Antoine doubles the amount of onions, so he uses 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions.
   - The cost of onions is $2.00 per pound, so the total cost for onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

2. Calculate the total cost of beef stock:
   - He needs 2 boxes of beef stock, each costing $2.00, so the total cost for beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

3. Calculate the total cost of all ingredients:
   - Total cost = cost of onions + cost of beef stock = $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

4. Calculate the cost per serving:
   - The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater and then calculate how much earlier she needs to leave to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.

1. **Determine Wayne's travel time:**
   - Wayne's travel time is 4 minutes.

2. **Determine Bernadette's travel time:**
   - Bernadette's travel time is four times Wayne's travel time.
   - Bernadette's travel time = 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

3. **Calculate the time difference:**
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.
   - Wayne arrives at the theater at time \( T \).
   - Bernadette needs to arrive at \( T - 5 \) minutes.
   - Since Bernadette's travel time is 16 minutes, she needs to leave 16 minutes before \( T - 5 \).

4. **Calculate the total time Bernadette needs to leave before Wayne:**
   - Wayne leaves at time \( T - 4 \) minutes (since his travel time is 4 minutes).
   - Bernadette needs to leave at \( T - 5 - 16 = T - 21 \) minutes.
   - The difference in their departure times is \( (T - 4) - (T - 21) = 17 \) minutes.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the dimensions of the room in feet. Given that the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, so we can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the room. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} \]
\[ P = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet.

"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of spotted puppies.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20
Total number of spotted puppies = 3 + 4 = 7

To find the percentage of spotted puppies, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of spotted puppies}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed.

1. **Sugar cubes:**
   - 2 boxes, each 1 pound.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags, each 12 pounds.
   - Total weight of carrots = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales, each 75 pounds.
   - Total weight of hay = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks, each 65 pounds.
   - Total weight of oats = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Next, we sum the weights of all the feed:
- Total weight of all feed = 2 (sugar cubes) + 48 (carrots) + 3150 (hay) + 1300 (oats) = 4500 pounds.

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since the farmer can't make a partial trip).

- Number of trips = 4500 / 2250 = 2.

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we first need to calculate the weekly earnings from both the aluminum cans and the plastic bottles, and then multiply by four.

1. Calculate the weekly earnings from aluminum cans:
   - Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week.
   - Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
   - Weekly earnings from aluminum cans = 3 cans * 2 cents/can = 6 cents.

2. Calculate the weekly earnings from plastic bottles:
   - Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week.
   - Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
   - Weekly earnings from plastic bottles = 5 bottles * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents.

3. Calculate the total weekly earnings:
   - Total weekly earnings = Earnings from aluminum cans + Earnings from plastic bottles
   - Total weekly earnings = 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents.

4. Calculate the monthly earnings:
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Monthly earnings = Total weekly earnings * 4 weeks
   - Monthly earnings = 21 cents * 4 = 84 cents.

Therefore, Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month.

"To determine how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set the equation equal to 5:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to isolate \( c \):

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we first need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we'll convert the remoras' lengths from inches to feet.

1 foot = 12 inches

Each remora is 6 inches long, so:
6 inches = 6 / 12 feet = 0.5 feet

Since there are 2 remoras, the combined length of the remoras is:
2 * 0.5 feet = 1 foot

The shark's body length is 10 feet. The percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents is calculated as follows:
(Combined length of remoras / Shark's body length) * 100

"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both.

Let:
- \( A \) be the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( B \) be the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

We are given:
- \( |A| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |B| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |A \cap B| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

We need to find the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both, which is \( |A \cup B| \).

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion:
\[ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| \]
\[ |A \cup B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both.

Brett is currently 14 years old. In four years, Brett will be \(14 + 4 = 18\) years old. At that time, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now, which means Angela will be \(3 \times 14 = 42\) years old in four years.

Let \(A\) represent Angela's current age. In four years, Angela's age will be \(A + 4\). According to the problem, this is equal to 42:

\[ A + 4 = 42 \]

To find Angela's current age, we solve for \(A\):

\[ A = 42 - 4 \]
\[ A = 38 \]

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so:

5 boxes * 10 oranges/box = 50 oranges

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:

50 oranges + 20 oranges = 70 oranges

Now, let's find the total number of oranges they have together:

50 oranges (Ashley) + 70 oranges (Brianne) = 120 oranges

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, the number of pies they can make is:

120 oranges / 3 oranges/pie = 40 pies

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation where the total cost for each venue is the same.

Let \( x \) be the number of guests.

**Cost for the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per person
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost for the second venue:**
- Cost per person: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We set the total costs equal to each other to find the number of guests \( x \) where the costs are the same:

\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

"Let's denote the number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi as \( L \), \( D \), and \( B \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following equations:

1. \( L + D + B = 43 \) (Total insects collected)
2. \( L = D + 7 \) (Lily found 7 more than David)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \) (David found half of what Bodhi found)

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \) using the third equation:
\[ B = 2D \]

Next, substitute \( B = 2D \) and \( L = D + 7 \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, substitute \( D = 9 \) back into the equations for \( L \) and \( B \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Thus, Lily found 16 insects.

"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to add the fractions of the skein they each used and then convert that to yards.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. First, we add these fractions:

\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \]

So, together they used \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein. 

Next, we convert \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein to yards. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273 \]

Therefore, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

\[ \text{Width of the rug} = \text{Width of the chair} + 5 \]
\[ \text{Width of the rug} = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, calculate the length of the couch:
\[ \text{Length of the couch} = 2 \times \text{Width of the rug} + 2 \]
\[ \text{Length of the couch} = 2 \times 8 + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of the couch is 18 feet.

4. She paid half as much for a pack of green apple gum, which means she paid $2 / 2 = $1 for the green apple gum.
5. The total amount she paid was $7.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \).

The total cost can be expressed as:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

1. **Cost and Stick Yield:**
   - A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and yields 200 sticks.
   - A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and yields 400 sticks.

2. **Budget:**
   - Frederick has $24 to spend.

3. **Cheapest Lumber:**
   - The cheapest lumber is the 2 x 4 piece of wood, which costs $4.

4. **Maximum Number of 2 x 4 Pieces:**
   - With $24, Frederick can buy \( \frac{24}{4} = 6 \) pieces of 2 x 4 wood.

5. **Total Number of Sticks from 2 x 4 Pieces:**
   - Each 2 x 4 piece yields 200 sticks.
   - Therefore, 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood will yield \( 6 \times 200 = 1200 \) sticks.

Thus, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make if he buys the cheapest lumber is 1200.

"To determine the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all his sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the price per pair of snowshoes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of legs.
Mario has 6 sled dogs, and each dog has 4 legs.
Total number of legs = 6 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 24 legs

Step 2: Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2.
Number of pairs of snowshoes = 24 legs / 2 legs/pair = 12 pairs

Step 3: Calculate the total cost.
Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
Total cost = 12 pairs * $12.00/pair = $144.00

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all his dogs is $144.00.

"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we first need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day, and each trip costs $2.20. Therefore, the cost per day is:
\[ 2 \times 2.20 = 4.40 \]

Since she takes these trips five days a week, the total cost per week is:
\[ 4.40 \times 5 = 22.00 \]

The cost of a weekly bus pass is $20.00. To find out how much she saves, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of the trips:
\[ 22.00 - 20.00 = 2.00 \]

Therefore, Janet would save $2.00 by buying a weekly bus pass.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.

From point 3, if the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, then the zoo has:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cows} \]

From point 4, if the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, then the farm has:
\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ sheep} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals on the farm and in the zoo:

- Farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
- Zoo: 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

Combined, the farm and the zoo have:

"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to determine the quantities based on the information that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought, we can set up the following equations:

Let \( O \) be the number of onions Sophia bought, and \( P \) be the number of potatoes Sophia bought.

According to the problem:
\[ 4O = 12 \]
\[ 4P = 4 \]

Solving for \( O \):
\[ O = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

Solving for \( P \):
\[ P = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:

"To determine Andy's daily calorie deficit, we first need to calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 lbs. and then divide that by the number of days he has until his birthday.

1. Calculate the total calories needed to lose 30 lbs.:
   - 1 pound = 3500 calories
   - 30 pounds = 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories

2. Determine the number of days from December 31st to July 19th:
   - From January 1 to July 19, we count the days in each month:
     - January: 31 days
     - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
     - March: 31 days
     - April: 30 days
     - May: 31 days
     - June: 30 days
     - July: 19 days (up to July 19)
   - Total days = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 days

3. Calculate the daily calorie deficit:
   - Total calories to lose / Number of days = 105,000 / 200 = 525 calories per day

Therefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of 525 calories to reach his goal by July 19th.

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the expression for \( H \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find the cost of the lot, we divide both sides by 4:

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the cost of the house is:

\[ 90,000 \]"
"To determine Tara's profit, we need to calculate her total cost and her total revenue, then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

1. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags, so she bought a total of \(8 \times 5 = 40\) canvas bags.
   - Each pack cost $4, so the total cost for the 8 packs is \(8 \times 4 = 32\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - Tara sold each of the 40 canvas bags for $8, so the total revenue is \(40 \times 8 = 320\) dollars.

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially:

- Ali has four $10 bills, which total to \(4 \times 10 = 40\) dollars.
- Ali has six $20 bills, which total to \(6 \times 20 = 120\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money Ali has is:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

"Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as \( C_O \) and the number of sofas Ophelia has as \( S_O \). According to the problem, Ophelia has 20 sofas, so \( S_O = 20 \).

Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can write:
\[ S_O = C_O - 2 \]
Substituting \( S_O = 20 \) into the equation:
\[ 20 = C_O - 2 \]
\[ C_O = 22 \]

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia:
\[ C_J = 3 \times C_O \]
\[ C_J = 3 \times 22 \]
\[ C_J = 66 \]

Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs:
\[ S_J = C_J - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 66 - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 64 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together:
\[ \text{Total sofas} = S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off:
   - 48 - 8 = 40 passengers remain on the bus.
3. 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus:
   - 5 * 8 = 40 passengers get on the bus.
   - 40 + 40 = 80 passengers are now on the bus.
4. On the second stop, 21 passengers get off:
   - 80 - 21 = 59 passengers remain on the bus.
5. 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus:
   - 21 / 3 = 7 passengers get on the bus.
   - 59 + 7 = 66 passengers are now on the bus.

The final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is 66.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \).

2. **Determine Jame's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.

3. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, the cousin's age in 8 years will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \).

4. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If the cousin will be 55 in 8 years, the cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \).

5. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - The current age difference is \( 47 - 22 = 25 \).

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is:

"To find the cost of one monitor, let's break down the information given:

1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400.
2. The computer costs $1,100.
3. The printer costs $400 less than the computer, so the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Let's denote the cost of one monitor as \( M \). Since Errol bought 2 monitors, the total cost for the monitors is \( 2M \).

The equation representing the total cost is:
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]

Subtract 1800 from both sides:
\[ 2M = 600 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ M = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is \( \boxed{300} \)."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of boys and girls:**
   - There are 20 kids in total.
   - They are divided into two equal groups of girls and boys.
   - Therefore, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

2. **Calculate the number of seashells brought by each boy:**
   - Each boy brought back 60 shells.
   - So, the total number of shells brought by all the boys is \( 10 \times 60 = 600 \) shells.

3. **Determine the number of seashells brought by each girl:**
   - Each girl brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.
   - The number of shells brought by the boys is 600.
   - Four times the number of shells brought by the boys is \( 4 \times 600 = 2400 \).
   - Therefore, each girl brought \( 600 + 2400 = 3000 \) shells.

So, each girl brought 3000 seashells.

"Let's denote the number of candies George originally had as \( G \). According to the problem, Nick had twice as many candies as George, so Nick had \( 2G \) candies.

After George ate 5 candies, he has 3 candies left. This can be expressed as:
\[ G - 5 = 3 \]

To find \( G \), we solve the equation:
\[ G - 5 = 3 \]
\[ G = 3 + 5 \]
\[ G = 8 \]

So, George originally had 8 candies. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, we calculate:
\[ 2G = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Therefore, Nick has 16 candies.

"To find out how old Anne is, we first need to determine Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we calculate Alyana's age as follows:

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4 years
Alyana's age = 10 years - 4 years
Alyana's age = 6 years

Next, we need to find out Anne's age. Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so:

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2 years
Anne's age = 6 years + 2 years
Anne's age = 8 years

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old.

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to add the thickness of each book together. Let's break it down:

1. The thickness of the first book is 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm.
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 mm = 62 mm.

Now, we add the thicknesses together:
31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm

188 mm"
"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to complete to reach her goal of 72 vlogs per month, we first add up the number of vlogs she has already made over the first three weeks:

18 vlogs (first week) + 21 vlogs (second week) + 15 vlogs (third week) = 54 vlogs

Next, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her monthly goal:

72 vlogs (goal) - 54 vlogs (already made) = 18 vlogs

Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs for the month.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of days in April:**
   April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves:**
   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Set up the savings for each half:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves per day in the first half.
   - He saves twice as much per day in the second half, so he saves \( 2x \) per day in the second half.

4. **Calculate the total savings for each half:**
   - Total savings in the first half: \( 15x \)
   - Total savings in the second half: \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \)

5. **Set up the equation to meet the monthly saving target:**
   \[
   15x + 30x = 1125

"Let's denote the amount Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

"To solve this, let's break down Elise's writing process:

1. First, she writes the full alphabet twice. The English alphabet has 26 letters, so writing it twice means she writes \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.
2. Next, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 is 13, so she writes 13 more letters.
3. Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written. At this point, she has written \(52 + 13 = 65\) letters. Rewriting all of these means she writes another 65 letters.

Adding all of these together, the total number of letters Elise has written is \(52 + 13 + 65 = 130\).

"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the 100 pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- Therefore, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we convert the total reading time into pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- The number of pages she reads per minute is \( \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \).

Now, we calculate the total number of pages read in the first week:
- Total pages in the first week = \( 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \).

Finally, we add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week:

The total amount spent on wooden action figures is:
\[ 4 \text{ days} \times \text{amount spent per day} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he has $70 initially, the remaining amount after buying wooden action figures is:
\[ 70 - 20 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the number of wooden action figures he buys:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ dollars}}{5 \text{ dollars per figure}} = 4 \text{ wooden action figures} \]

For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday), he buys plastic action figures:
- Each plastic action figure costs $2.
- He spends an equal amount each day for 3 days.

The total amount spent on plastic action figures is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times \text{amount spent per day} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ dollars per day} \]
\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

The number of plastic action figures he buys is:
\[ \frac{50 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ dollars per figure}} = 25 \text{ plastic action figures} \]

Finally, the total number of action figures he has by the end of the week is:
\[ 4 \text{ wooden action figures} + 25 \text{ plastic action figures} = 29 \text{ action figures} \]

"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.
2. Calculate the total number of roses the flower shops order in a month.
3. Determine the difference between the total number of roses ordered and the total number of roses grown.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month. Assuming a month has 4 weeks:
\[ 40 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 160 \text{ roses/month} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of roses the flower shops order in a month. The first shop orders 20 roses, the second shop orders 15 roses, and the third shop orders 30 roses per week. So, the total number of roses ordered per week is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses/week} \]

Now, for a month (4 weeks):
\[ 65 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 260 \text{ roses/month} \]

Finally, we determine the difference between the total number of roses ordered and the total number of roses grown:
\[ 260 \text{ roses/month} - 160 \text{ roses/month} = 100 \text{ roses/month} \]

So, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off when set to 450 degrees. The actual temperature is 468 degrees, so the oven is overheating by 18 degrees.

The percentage increase can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Temperature} - \text{Set Temperature}}{\text{Set Temperature}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 0.04 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 4\% \]

Now, we need to find the set temperature that will result in an actual temperature of 520 degrees, given that the oven is 4% higher than the set temperature.

Let \( x \) be the set temperature. The actual temperature is 4% higher than \( x \):
\[ \text{Actual Temperature} = x + 0.04x \]
\[ \text{Actual Temperature} = 1.04x \]

We want the actual temperature to be 520 degrees:
\[ 1.04x = 520 \]
\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]
\[ x = 500 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

1. On Monday, Howard spends $8.
2. On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
3. On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as on Tuesday, which is \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, we add up the amounts spent over the three days:
\[ 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \]

Howard originally had $100, so the amount left after spending $88 is:
\[ 100 - 88 = 12 \]

"To find out how much money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the earnings from each period and then sum them up.

For the first four hours:
- He sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Therefore, his earnings per hour were 15 cups * $0.50/cup = $7.50.
- Over four hours, his total earnings were 4 hours * $7.50/hour = $30.00.

For the next two hours:
- He sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Therefore, his earnings per hour were 10 cups * $0.60/cup = $6.00.
- Over two hours, his total earnings were 2 hours * $6.00/hour = $12.00.

Adding the earnings from both periods:
- Total earnings = $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one month.
2. Determine the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one year.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for the tires to reach the maximum number of rotations before they need to be replaced.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations in one month.**

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. Every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. 

First, find out how many 2-mile segments are in 400 miles:
\[ \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/segment}} = 200 \text{ segments} \]

Next, calculate the total number of rotations in one month:
\[ 200 \text{ segments} \times 725 \text{ rotations/segment} = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of rotations in one year.**

There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many years it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations.**

Divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the number of rotations per year:
\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

So, the tire will need to be replaced in 6 years.

"To find out how much each pump costs, we first need to determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from the bottle if she uses 1 pump per wash. Since the bottle provides 120 washes with 2 pumps per wash, doubling the number of washes by using 1 pump per wash gives us:

120 washes * 2 = 240 washes

Next, we calculate the cost per wash. The bottle costs $24.00, so we divide this by the total number of washes:

$24.00 / 240 washes = $0.10 per wash

Since each wash now uses 1 pump, the cost per pump is the same as the cost per wash. Converting this to cents:

$0.10 * 100 cents/dollar = 10 cents

\[ 60 \times 0.70 = 42 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After spending $42, the amount of money Joe will have left is:

\[ 50 - 42 = 8 \]

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb per second to kb per hour.
2. Convert the speed from kb per hour to Mb per hour.

First, we convert the speed from kb per second to kb per hour:
- There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.
- Ashley's speed is 20 kb per second, so in one hour, she can download 20 kb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72,000 kb/hour.

Next, we convert the speed from kb per hour to Mb per hour:
- Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we divide the speed in kb per hour by 1000 to get the speed in Mb per hour.
- 72,000 kb/hour / 1000 = 72 Mb/hour.

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed in Mb per hour is 72 Mb/hour.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we first calculate the cost per class if he attends all 10 classes. The total cost is $60, so the cost per class is:

\[ \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars per class} \]

This is within the limit set by his parents. Now, we need to find out how many classes he can miss before the cost per class he attends exceeds $10.

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny misses. Then, he attends \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class he attends is:

\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We set this equal to $10 to find the maximum number of classes he can miss:

\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} = 10 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 60 = 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 = 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x = 40 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

So, Manny can miss 4 classes before the cost per class he attends exceeds $10. If he misses 5 or more classes, the cost per class will be more than $10, and his parents won't sign him up again.

   \text{Cost of running boards} = 2,500 - 500 = 2,000
   \]
5. **Upgraded exterior light package**: $1,500

Now, we sum up all these costs:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 30,000 + 7,500 + 2,500 + 2,000 + 1,500
\]

Calculating the total:
\[
30,000 + 7,500 = 37,500
\]
\[
37,500 + 2,500 = 40,000
\]
\[
40,000 + 2,000 = 42,000

"To calculate Tim's new annual salary after the promotion, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new monthly salary after the 5% raise.
2. Calculate the bonus, which is half of his new monthly salary.
3. Calculate the total annual salary, including the bonus.

**Step 1: Calculate the new monthly salary.**

Tim's original monthly salary is $20,000. A 5% raise on this salary is calculated as:
\[ 20,000 \times 0.05 = 1,000 \]

So, the new monthly salary is:
\[ 20,000 + 1,000 = 21,000 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the bonus.**

The bonus is half of the new monthly salary:
\[ 21,000 \times 0.5 = 10,500 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total annual salary.**

Tim's annual salary from his monthly pay is:
\[ 21,000 \times 12 = 252,000 \]

Adding the bonus to the annual salary:
\[ 252,000 + 10,500 = 262,500 \]

Therefore, Tim will make $262,500 in a year.

"To find the total cost of everything James bought, we need to calculate the cost of the suits, the dress pants, and the dress shirts, and then sum these amounts.

1. **Cost of the suits:**
   - James buys 10 suits.
   - Each suit costs $750.
   - Total cost of the suits = 10 suits * $750/suit = $7500.

2. **Cost of the dress pants:**
   - James buys 10 dress pants.
   - Each dress pant costs 1/5 of the cost of a suit.
   - Cost of one dress pant = $750 / 5 = $150.
   - Total cost of the dress pants = 10 dress pants * $150/dress pant = $1500.

3. **Cost of the dress shirts:**
   - James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
   - He buys 10 suits, so he buys 10 suits * 3 dress shirts/suit = 30 dress shirts.
   - Each dress shirt costs $60.
   - Total cost of the dress shirts = 30 dress shirts * $60/dress shirt = $1800.

4. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the suits + Cost of the dress pants + Cost of the dress shirts
   - Total cost = $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400.
   - The sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats were \( 2 \times 400 = 800 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first month:**
   - Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total sales in the first month = \( 400 + 800 = 1200 \) dollars.

3. **Determine the sales for the second month:**
   - In the second month, her sales were \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total sales of the first month.
   - Sales in the second month = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total sales for two months:**
   - Total sales for two months = Sales in the first month + Sales in the second month

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

1. Each animal has one head, so the total number of heads gives us the equation:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]

2. Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs, so the total number of legs gives us the equation:
   \[
   4S + 2G = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
   \[
   2S + G = 35
   \]

Now we have the system of equations:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]
   \[
   2S + G = 35
   \]

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
   \[
   (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20
   \]
   \[
   2S + G - S - G = 15

2. **Count the number of good, bad, and neutral days in the first thirty days**:
   - Good days: 12
   - Bad days: 8
   - Neutral days: 30 - (12 + 8) = 10

3. **Determine the distribution of moods over the first three sets of eight days**:
   - First 8 days: All good
   - Second 8 days: All bad
   - Third 8 days: All neutral

4. **Calculate the remaining days in the month**:
   - Total days: 30
   - Days already accounted for: 8 (good) + 8 (bad) + 8 (neutral) = 24
   - Remaining days: 30 - 24 = 6

5. **Determine the moods for the next three days**:
   - Next 3 days: Good, Neutral, Good

6. **Update the count of good days**:
   - Initial good days: 12
   - Additional good days: 2 (from the next three days)
   - Total good days: 12 + 2 = 14

7. **Calculate the number of good days left in the month**:
   - Remaining days: 6 - 3 = 3
   - Since the next three days are already accounted for, the remaining three days are not specified, so we assume they are not good days.

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is:
14 - 2 = 12

However, since the problem asks for the number of good days left in the month after the next three days, the correct answer is:

"To find out how many signatures the sisters need to collect to reach their goal, we first need to determine how many signatures they already have together and then subtract this from their goal.

Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. Together, they have:
20 + 44 = 64 signatures.

Their goal is to have 100 signatures by the end of the summer. Therefore, the number of signatures they still need to collect is:
100 - 64 = 36 signatures.

"First, we determine how much Karen earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how much Karen earns in one day. If she works 3 hours per day, her daily earnings are:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Finally, to find out how much Karen earns in two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2:

\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the number of cookies each person has in terms of the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has. Let's denote the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as \( C \).

1. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so Max has \( C + 12 \) cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Katarina has \( (C + 12) - 5 = C + 7 \) cookies.
3. We are given that Katarina has 68 cookies, so \( C + 7 = 68 \). Solving for \( C \), we get \( C = 61 \).
4. Now, we know the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.
5. Max has \( C + 12 = 61 + 12 = 73 \) cookies.
6. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has \( 73 + 23 = 96 \) cookies.

Now, we can find the total number of cookies by adding the cookies each person has:
- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

Total cookies = \( 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 \).

"To find the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length of the dress as \( L \) in centimeters. According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds an additional 20 cm of lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

First, we express the extension of the dress in terms of \( L \):
- The extension is 50% of \( L \), which is \( 0.5L \).

So, the length of the dress after the extension but before adding the lace trim is:
\[ L + 0.5L = 1.5L \]

Next, we add the 20 cm of lace trim to this extended length:
\[ 1.5L + 20 \]

We know that the final length of the dress is 140 cm, so we set up the equation:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

To find \( L \), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ L = 80 \]

Thus, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( R \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write the equation:
\[ T = R + 7 \]

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. Since there are two twins and three triplets, we can write the equation:
\[ 2T + 3R = 44 \]

Now, substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( R = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = R + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of each candy. We know the total cost of five lollipops and four candies is $3.20, and each lollipop costs $0.40.

First, calculate the total cost of the lollipops:
\[ 5 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.40 \text{ per lollipop} = \$2.00 \]

Next, subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the candies:
\[ \$3.20 - \$2.00 = \$1.20 \]

This $1.20 is the total cost for four candies. To find the cost of one candy, divide the total cost of the candies by the number of candies:
\[ \frac{\$1.20}{4 \text{ candies}} = \$0.30 \text{ per candy} \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. First, calculate the cost of 10 lollipops:
\[ 10 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.40 \text{ per lollipop} = \$4.00 \]

Next, calculate the cost of 10 candies:
\[ 10 \text{ candies} \times \$0.30 \text{ per candy} = \$3.00 \]

Finally, add the costs of the lollipops and candies to find the total cost:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many coins Neil saves each month compared to Rong.

Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong. This means Neil saves an additional \( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \) coins more than Rong each month.

So, Neil saves \( 20 + 8 = 28 \) coins every month.

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each of them saves in ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so in ten years, there are \( 10 \times 12 = 120 \) months.

Rong's total savings over ten years:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings over ten years:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding both totals together:
\[ 2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

Therefore, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:

"First, let's determine the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Let \( T \) be the total bill. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so:
\[ \text{Heartworm check} = 0.60T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.60T \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T - 0.60T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

   - There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Cost of apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Cost of oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as one banana.
   - One banana costs $1, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.

"To find the total number of squares on Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares**: There are 14 red squares.
2. **Blue Squares**: There are 4 more blue squares than red squares. Therefore, the number of blue squares is:
   \[
   14 + 4 = 18
   \]
3. **Green Squares**: There are 6 more green squares than blue squares. Therefore, the number of green squares is:
   \[
   18 + 6 = 24
   \]
4. **White Squares**: There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. Therefore, the number of white squares is:
   \[
   24 - 12 = 12

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much candy each person has left after two weeks and then find the difference.

First, let's determine how many days are in two weeks:
2 weeks * 7 days/week = 14 days

Next, we calculate how much candy Ginger eats in 14 days:
4 pieces/day * 14 days = 56 pieces

So, Ginger has:
100 pieces - 56 pieces = 44 pieces left

Now, we calculate how much candy Amy eats in 14 days:
3 pieces/day * 14 days = 42 pieces

So, Amy has:
100 pieces - 42 pieces = 58 pieces left

Finally, we find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger:
58 pieces - 44 pieces = 14 pieces

"To determine how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs, we first calculate the area of the bathroom that he wants to cover. The bathroom is 36 square feet, and he wants to cover two-thirds of it.

First, we find two-thirds of 36 square feet:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24 \text{ square feet}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of mosaic tiles needed for 24 square feet. Since he needs 24 tiles per square foot:
\[
24 \text{ tiles/sq ft} \times 24 \text{ sq ft} = 576 \text{ tiles}
\]

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his 36 square foot bathroom.

First, let's determine the number of weekdays and weekends in two 4-week months:
- Each week has 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days.
- In 4 weeks, there are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) weekdays and \(4 \times 2 = 8\) weekend days.
- In two 4-week months, there are \(2 \times 20 = 40\) weekdays and \(2 \times 8 = 16\) weekend days.

Next, we calculate the total number of chairs rented on weekdays and weekends:
- During weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day. So, for 40 weekdays, the total number of chairs rented is \(60 \times 40 = 2400\).
- During weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day. So, for 16 weekend days, the total number of chairs rented is \(100 \times 16 = 1600\).

Finally, we add the total number of chairs rented on weekdays and weekends:
- Total chairs rented = \(2400 + 1600 = 4000\).

Thus, the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Gunther initially had 48 bananas.
2. Arnold stole half of the bananas, so Gunther lost 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.
3. After Arnold's theft, Gunther had 48 - 24 = 24 bananas left.
4. The next day, Gunther added 25 bananas to his pile, so he had 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.
5. Later that evening, Arnold stole another 12 bananas, so Gunther had 49 - 12 = 37 bananas left.
6. On the third day, Gunther added 6 more bananas to his pile, so he had 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

Therefore, Gunther found 43 bananas in the pile.

"To solve this problem, we need to break down the trades step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.
   - Each large button is worth three small stickers, so 27 small buttons = 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth one large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons.

5. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

6. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Each large sticker is worth three small buttons.
   - 20 large stickers = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

7. **Total Buttons:**
   - Large buttons: 9 (from small stickers) + 20 (from large stickers) = 29 large buttons.
   - Small buttons: 3 (remaining small stickers) + 60 (from remaining large stickers) = 63 small buttons.

8. **Total Number of Buttons:**
   - Total buttons = 29 large buttons + 63 small buttons = 92 buttons.

"Let's denote the number of votes in favor of the new regulation as \( F \) and the number of votes against it as \( A \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, which can be expressed as:
\[ F = 2A \]

The total number of people on the council is 33, so the total number of votes is also 33. This gives us the equation:
\[ F + A = 33 \]

We can substitute \( F = 2A \) into the second equation:
\[ 2A + A = 33 \]
\[ 3A = 33 \]
\[ A = 11 \]

Now, substituting \( A = 11 \) back into the equation \( F = 2A \):
\[ F = 2 \times 11 \]
\[ F = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \). According to the problem, the second house needs twice as many cases as the first house, so the second house will need \( 2x \) cases. The third house needs double the amount of the first house, so the third house will need \( 2x \) cases as well.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is given as 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases of shingles, so:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Thus, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To determine Tanya's earnings, we need to calculate her earnings for each day and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour, so for 5 hours, she earns \( 15 \times 5 = 75 \) dollars.
- Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she earns an additional $5 per day.
- Therefore, her total earnings for Monday are \( 75 + 5 = 80 \) dollars.

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour, so for 2 hours, she earns \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \) dollars.
- Since she teaches 2 classes, which is not more than 3, she does not earn the additional $5 per day.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the Llesis family traveled, which includes both the distance they drove and the distance they hiked.

First, let's determine the speed at which they hiked. The problem states that they hiked at an average speed of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Since they drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour, half of this speed is 25 miles per hour. Therefore, their hiking speed is:
\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Distance hiked} = 1.5 \times 20 = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to find out how long they drove. The total travel time was 6 hours, and they spent 1.5 hours hiking, so the time spent driving is:
\[ 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 \text{ hours} \]

The distance they drove is calculated by multiplying the driving time by their driving speed:
\[ \text{Distance driven} = 4.5 \times 50 = 225 \text{ miles} \]

"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish Bob bought as \( W \). Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying 17 more fish, the total number of fish he had was:

\[ 3 + O \text{ (orange fish)} \]
\[ 4 + W \text{ (white fish)} \]

According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]
\[ O = 5 + 2W \]

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17:

\[ O + W = 17 \]

Now we substitute \( O = 5 + 2W \) into the equation \( O + W = 17 \):

\[ 5 + 2W + W = 17 \]
\[ 5 + 3W = 17 \]
\[ 3W = 12 \]
\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

Next, let's calculate the total value of the twenties:
- Each twenty is worth $20.
- Carrie has ten twenties.
- Total value of the twenties = 10 * $20 = $200.

Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties:
- Amount spent from the twenties = 3/5 * $200 = $120.

Now, we add the amount spent from the quarters and the amount spent from the twenties to find the total amount spent on lunch:
- Total amount spent = $35 + $120 = $155.

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is $155.

"To find the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total yield from both the tomato plants and the eggplant plants and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the total number of tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants.
- Therefore, the total number of tomatoes is \(22 \times 5 = 110\).

Next, we calculate the total number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.
- Therefore, the total number of eggplants is \(4 \times 8 = 32\).

Finally, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:
- Total fruits = 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits.

"To find out how many OLED TVs Samwell's store sold, we first need to determine the fraction of the total sales that OLED TVs represent. We know that one-fourth of the sales are smart TVs and one-eighth are analog TVs. Let's add these fractions to find the total fraction of sales that are not OLED TVs:

\[
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{8}
\]

This means that \(\frac{3}{8}\) of the total sales are either smart TVs or analog TVs. Therefore, the fraction of the total sales that are OLED TVs is:

\[
1 - \frac{3}{8} = \frac{8}{8} - \frac{3}{8} = \frac{5}{8}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many TVs this fraction represents out of the total 40 TVs sold:

\[
\frac{5}{8} \times 40 = \frac{5 \times 40}{8} = \frac{200}{8} = 25
\]

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of groups formed.
2. Calculate the number of groups that brought back seashells.
3. Determine the total number of seashells brought back by these groups.

**Step 1: Determine the total number of groups formed.**

The total number of people is 90, and each group consists of 9 people. Therefore, the number of groups is:
\[ \frac{90}{9} = 10 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of groups that brought back seashells.**

According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the groups each had members bring back seashells. So, the number of groups that brought back seashells is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]

**Step 3: Determine the total number of seashells brought back by these groups.**

Each of these 6 groups had 9 members, and each member brought back 2 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is:
\[ 6 \times 9 \times 2 = 108 \]

So, the total number of seashells brought back is:

"To find out how much money Mike will have left over, we first need to calculate the discount and the final price of the jeans.

The original price of the jeans is $40. A 25% discount means the discount amount is 25% of $40.

Discount amount = 25% of $40 = 0.25 * $40 = $10

So, the price after the discount is:

Price after discount = Original price - Discount amount = $40 - $10 = $30

If Mike pays with a $50 bill, the amount of money he will have left over is:

Change = Amount paid - Price after discount = $50 - $30 = $20

Therefore, Mike will have $20 left over.

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy to make them 30% of her total collection, we first need to calculate the current total number of stuffed animals she has.

Bubbles currently has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

The total number of stuffed animals is:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

To solve for \( x \), we first distribute the 0.30:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To find out how much James paid for the ring, we first need to calculate the total cost of the materials, which is the sum of the cost of the diamond and the gold. 

The cost of the diamond is $600, and the cost of the gold is $300. So, the total cost of the materials is:

\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

Next, we need to calculate the 30% premium on the total cost of the materials. A 30% premium means an additional 30% of the total cost of the materials. 

To find 30% of $900, we multiply 900 by 0.30:

\[ 900 \times 0.30 = 270 \]

Now, we add this premium to the original cost of the materials to find the total amount James paid:

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed on average per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches climbed in the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in the week to find the average per day.

First, we know that Felix made $105 in a week. Since he charges $0.25 per branch, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total earnings by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches} = 420 \]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables for the amounts of each ingredient Tanya uses in ounces. Let:
- \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest,
- \( f \) be the amount of fragrance,
- \( s \) be the amount of salt,
- \( g \) be the amount of sugar,
- \( o \) be the amount of oil.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( z = f \) (same amount of citrus zest as fragrance),
2. \( s = g \) (same amount of salt as sugar),
3. \( o = 2s \) (twice as much oil as salt),
4. \( s = 2z \) (twice as much salt as zest).

We also know the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces:
\[ z + f + s + g + o = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 2s + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]

Since \( s = 2z \), substitute \( s \) in the equation:
\[ 2z + 4(2z) = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 8z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, find \( s \):
\[ s = 2z = 2 \times 1 = 2 \]

Finally, find \( o \):
\[ o = 2s = 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Thus, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. The number of cars he gives away is:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of cars Joe has left after selling and giving away cars:
\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Thus, Joe remains with 16 cars.

"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount raised by the students. The total amount raised for the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

Since there are 20 students, and they each earned the same amount, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

Each student raised $6,250.

"To find the total time Sandy took to walk over the two days in minutes, we first need to calculate the total time in hours and then convert it to minutes.

1. On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours.
2. On the second day, she walked for half as many hours as the first day, which is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) hours.

Now, we add the hours from both days:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we convert the total hours to minutes. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes.

"To find out how many total points Sasha scored during both games, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.
2. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points.
3. In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.

Now, we add the points Sasha scored in both games:
- First game: 14 points
- Second game: 4 points

Total points scored by Sasha: \(14 + 4 = 18\)

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( P = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

So, Becca has 153 cards.

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much Anthony has saved.
2. Calculate how much Roy has saved based on Anthony's savings.

First, we know Eva has saved $20.00. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so:
\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Next, Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings:
\[ 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \]

Therefore, Roy's total savings are:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the height Naruto can lift a mountain based on the given relationships and the height Pompei can lift a mountain.

1. **Determine the height Saskay can lift a mountain:**
   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain \( 12 \times 1 = 12 \) inches.

2. **Determine the height Kagiyami can lift a mountain:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) inches.

3. **Determine the height Naruto can lift a mountain:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain \( 10 \times 48 = 480 \) inches.

4. **Convert the height from inches to feet:**

"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance he covered in each part of his journey and then sum these distances.

1. First, we calculate the distance he traveled in the first 4 hours:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. Next, we calculate the distance he traveled in the next 6 hours:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and then use that to find out how long it will take the turtles to travel the same distance.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can find the total distance by considering the combined speed of the kangaroos.
   - Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( v \) (distance per hour).
   - The combined speed of 3 kangaroos is \( 3v \).
   - The total distance \( D \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     D = 3v \times 18 \text{ hours}
     \]
     \[
     D = 54v
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).
   - The combined speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for the turtles to travel the same distance:**
   - The total distance \( D \) is 54v.
   - The time \( T \) it takes for the turtles to travel this distance is given by:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\text{combined speed of turtles}} = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take the four turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

"Let's denote the number of clay dishes made by Kora as \( K \), by Rory as \( R \), and by Jada as \( J \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Kora made 20 dishes, so \( K = 20 \).
2. Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so \( R = K + 20 \).
3. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so \( J = 2R \).

First, we calculate the number of dishes Rory made:
\[ R = K + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the number of dishes Jada made:
\[ J = 2R = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Now, we sum the number of dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora:
\[ J + R + K = 80 + 40 + 20 = 140 \]

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after all contributions and then subtract the cost of the laptop after the trade-in.

1. The original cost of the laptop is $600.
2. The trade-in reduces the price by $200, so the new cost is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
4. Her mom gives her $80.
5. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( P \).

The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of her purse money, her job earnings, and her mom's contribution:
\[ P + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount is $50 less than the cost of the laptop after the trade-in:
\[ P + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]
\[ P + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( P \):
\[ P = 350 - 230 \]
\[ P = 120 \]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first calculate the total milk production with the current number of cows. 

The farmer currently has 3 cows, and each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day. Therefore, the total milk production per day is:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows required is:

"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and then add it to the principal amount.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = P \times r \times t \]
where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount ($300),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (three-quarters of the original amount, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year, or 75% of the principal),
- \( t \) is the time in years (3 years).

First, we calculate the annual interest rate as a decimal:
\[ r = \frac{225}{300} = 0.75 \]

Now, we can calculate the simple interest:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3 = 675 \]

Next, we add the simple interest to the principal to find the total amount:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - You buy 3 baskets of red food.
   - Total cost for red food before discount = 3 * $18 = $54.

3. Calculate the total discount for the red food baskets:
   - You get $2 off for each basket of red food.
   - You buy 3 baskets of red food.
   - Total discount = 3 * $2 = $6.

4. Calculate the total cost for the red food baskets after the discount:
   - Total cost for red food after discount = $54 - $6 = $48.

5. Calculate the total cost for all the baskets:

"In the first year, the town will build 12 homes. In the second year, they will build three times as many homes as in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes. By the end of the second year, the total number of homes built will be 12 + 36 = 48 homes. In the third year, they will double the total amount of homes built by the end of the second year, which is 2 * 48 = 96 homes. Therefore, the total number of homes built over the next three years will be 48 (from the first two years) + 96 (from the third year) = 144 homes.

"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- My age: \( x \)
- My brother's age: \( x + 3 \)
- My sister's age: \( x - 2 \)
- My mom's age: \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \)

According to the problem, the sum of all our ages is 87. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87 \]

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 9 - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 8 = 87 \]

\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 6x = 78 \]

"First, let's calculate how much money Rafaela received in tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate Rafaela's total tips as follows:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we need to determine how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total, we calculate:

\[ 10\% \times 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

So, Julieta received $80 less than Rafaela. Therefore, Julieta's total tips are:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Now, to find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their individual totals:

"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as \( A \), the number of books that Sofie has as \( S \), and the number of books that Fawn has as \( F \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (the total number of books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, substitute \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now, substitute \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]

"To find out how much Mark makes a week after his pay raise, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine Mark's new hourly wage: His original wage was $10 per hour, and he received a raise of $2 per hour.
   - New hourly wage = $10 + $2 = $12 per hour

2. Calculate the total number of hours Mark works in a week: He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week.
   - Total hours per week = 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week

3. Calculate Mark's weekly earnings with his new hourly wage:
   - Weekly earnings = New hourly wage * Total hours per week
   - Weekly earnings = $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week

Therefore, Mark makes $480 a week.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the payments for mowing lawns:**
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for mowing his lawn.
   - Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.

2. **Determine the number of times Tasha mowed other lawns:**
   - Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
   - Tasha mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

3. **Calculate the total payment from mowing lawns:**
   - Joe's payment: \( 6J \) dollars.
   - Kamala's payment: \( 6 \times 3J = 18J \) dollars.
   - Alba's payment: \( 6 \times 5J = 30J \) dollars.
   - Total payment from mowing lawns: \( 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J \) dollars.

4. **Determine the total earnings:**
   - Tasha made a total of $80 last month.
   - Let \( L \) be the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales.
   - Therefore, \( L + 54J = 80 \).

5. **Solve for \( J \):**
   - Since Joe paid $6, and we need to find the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn, we need to find \( J \).
   - From the equation \( L + 54J = 80 \), we need to find \( J \) such that \( 54J \) is a multiple of 6 and fits within the total earnings of $80.

6. **Determine the value of \( J \):**
   - If \( J = 1 \), then \( 54J = 54 \), and \( L = 80 - 54 = 26 \).

7. **Verify the solution:**
   - If \( J = 1 \), then Tasha mowed Joe's lawn once, Kamala's lawn three times, and Alba's lawn five times.
   - Total payment from mowing lawns: \( 6 \times 1 + 18 \times 1 + 30 \times 1 = 6 + 18 + 30 = 54 \) dollars.
   - Total earnings: \( 54 + 26 = 80 \) dollars, which matches the given total.

Therefore, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bowls of soup are left after Calvin and his family have eaten dinner.

1. The pot contains enough soup to fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.
2. Calvin and his wife are adults, so they will each have 1 adult bowl.
3. Each of the two children will have 1 child bowl.

First, we convert the adult bowls to child bowls to make the calculations easier:
- 1 adult bowl = 2 child bowls (since 4 adult bowls = 8 child bowls, 1 adult bowl = 8 / 4 = 2 child bowls).

Now, calculate the total number of child bowls used for dinner:
- Calvin and his wife: 2 adults * 2 child bowls/adult = 4 child bowls.
- The two children: 2 children * 1 child bowl/child = 2 child bowls.

Total child bowls used for dinner:
- 4 child bowls (adults) + 2 child bowls (children) = 6 child bowls.

The pot originally contains 8 child bowls of soup. After dinner, the number of child bowls left is:
- 8 child bowls - 6 child bowls = 2 child bowls.

Since there are 2 child bowls left and 2 children, each child will be able to have 1 bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

"To determine the total amount of material Jo needs, we first calculate the material required for the small and large masks separately, and then sum these amounts.

1. **Material for small masks:**
   - Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
   - For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

2. **Material for large masks:**
   - Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
   - For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

3. **Total material needed:**
   - Adding the material for small and large masks: \( 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards} \).

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58. We are also given that there are 20 red balloons.

First, we can set up the equation for the total number of pieces of bologna:
\[ 2R + 3Y = 58 \]

We know that \( R = 20 \). Substituting this value into the equation, we get:
\[ 2(20) + 3Y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]

Next, we solve for \( Y \):
\[ 3Y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3Y = 18 \]
\[ Y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ Y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is 6.

   - Therefore, a mini blueberry muffin has \( 450 \times \frac{1}{3} = 150 \) calories.

3. **Total calories for all mini cinnamon rolls:**
   - Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls.
   - Total calories = \( 200 \times 200 = 40,000 \) calories.

4. **Total calories for all mini blueberry muffins:**
   - Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins.
   - Total calories = \( 300 \times 150 = 45,000 \) calories.

5. **Total calories for all pastries:**
   - Total calories = \( 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 \) calories.

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to add up the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days and then divide by the number of days.

- Monday: 39 Junebugs
- Tuesday: 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs
- Wednesday: 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs
- Thursday: 48 Junebugs
- Friday: 57 Junebugs

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57

Now, let's calculate the total and then find the average.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300

Number of days = 5

Average number of Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days = 300 / 5 = 60

"To determine how much farther the bus went than the car, we first calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

For the bus:
- Speed: 60 miles per hour
- Time: 5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

For the car:
- Speed: 30 miles per hour
- Time: 8 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Next, we find the difference in the distances traveled:
- Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car.

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Q \), and \( J \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + Q + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Q = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Q + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( Q \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find \( Q \) and \( P \):
\[
Q = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"To find the total number of water balloons, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Maria invited 4 friends, so there are 5 people in total (Maria + 4 friends).
2. At the start, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, so:
   - 4 friends * 2 balloons each = 8 balloons
3. Maria had 1 water balloon for herself, so:
   - 1 balloon for Maria
4. Maria's mom then gave each person 3 more balloons, so:
   - 5 people * 3 balloons each = 15 balloons

Now, let's add up all the balloons:
- 8 balloons (given to friends) + 1 balloon (for Maria) + 15 balloons (given by mom) = 24 balloons

So, the total number of balloons is 24.

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs, we first calculate the amount of hay required for the goats and the sheep separately.

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. With 15 goats, the total hay needed for the goats is:
\[ 5 \text{ pounds/goat} \times 15 \text{ goats} = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, each sheep needs:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

With 12 sheep, the total hay needed for the sheep is:
\[ 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} \times 12 \text{ sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the hay needed for the goats and the sheep gives the total amount of hay required:

1. **Visit Fee**: $40
2. **Labor Cost**: $35 per hour for 2.25 hours. Since the charge is per hour or part thereof, we round 2.25 hours up to 3 hours.
   - Labor cost = 3 hours * $35/hour = $105
3. **Parts Cost**: $60

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total charge:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs after the 40% discount.

The original cost of each CD is $15. With a 40% discount, the discount amount per CD is:
\[ 15 \times 0.40 = 6 \]

So, the cost per CD after the discount is:
\[ 15 - 6 = 9 \]

The total cost for 10 CDs is:
\[ 10 \times 9 = 90 \]

Next, James sells 5 of the CDs for $40. The total amount he receives from selling these 5 CDs is:
\[ 5 \times 40 = 200 \]

However, this seems incorrect because the selling price per CD should be a single value, not a total. Let's assume he sells each of the 5 CDs for $40 in total, which means:
\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the total amount he receives from selling the 5 CDs is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Now, we calculate the net amount James is out:
\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

So, the final amount of money James was out is:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.

2. **Calculate the time it takes for the initial swim:**
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time for the initial swim: \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \) hours.

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   - James rests for half as long as the initial swim time.
   - Rest time: \( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   - The total distance is 20 miles, and he has already swum 12 miles.
   - Remaining distance: \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   - James swims the remaining distance at half his initial speed.
   - New speed: \( \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \) mile per hour.

6. **Calculate the time for the remaining swim:**
   - Time for the remaining swim: \( \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \) hours.

7. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Total time = Time for initial swim + Rest time + Time for remaining swim
   - Total time: \( 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \) hours.

The total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours.

"To calculate the total commission Cayley earns, we need to determine the commission from each type of newspaper and then sum these amounts.

First, calculate the commission from the New York Times:
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- Cayley earns a 10% commission on each copy.
- The commission per copy of the New York Times is \( 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \) dollars.
- For 6 copies, the total commission is \( 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \) dollars.

Next, calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- Cayley earns an 8% commission on each copy.
- The commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is \( 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \) dollars.
- For 10 copies, the total commission is \( 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \) dollars.

"To solve this problem, let's start by identifying the relationships and the given information:

1. Deanna is 26 years old.
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna.
3. Marcus is half of Leo’s age.

First, calculate Marcus's age:
\[ \text{Marcus's age} = \text{Deanna's age} - 5 = 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Next, since Marcus is half of Leo’s age, we can set up the equation:
\[ \text{Marcus's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Leo's age} \]
\[ 21 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Leo's age} \]

To find Leo's age, multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

We are also given that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar. This gives us the following equations:
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

We can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Substituting these expressions into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Simplify and solve for \( B \):
\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3B = 75 \]
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Thus, Azibo scored:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of corn chips each of the two people received:**
   - Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips.

2. **Determine the number of corn chips Collins received:**
   - According to the problem, Collins received 15 more corn chips than Amora or Lainey.
   - Therefore, Collins received \( 70 + 15 = 85 \) corn chips.

3. **Calculate the total number of corn chips:**
   - Add the number of corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins.
   - Total corn chips = \( 70 + 70 + 85 \).

4. **Perform the addition:**
   - \( 70 + 70 = 140 \)
   - \( 140 + 85 = 225 \)

Thus, the total number of corn chips is 225.

"To find out how much the travel costs, we first need to calculate 50% of the total cost of the supplies and then add that to the original cost of the supplies.

The cost of the supplies is $400. 

50% of $400 is calculated as:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the total cost for the travel tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the travel costs $600.

"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( X + S + A = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, substitute \( X \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (S + 5) + S + A = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A = 334 \]

Next, substitute \( S \) from the third equation into the equation \( 2S + A = 334 \):
\[ 2(4A - 13) + A = 334 \]
\[ 8A - 26 + A = 334 \]
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, substitute \( A = 40 \) back into the third equation to find \( S \):
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

"To find out how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of brownies Greta had initially.
2. Subtract the number of brownies eaten during the party.

First, let's convert all quantities to the same unit (individual brownies). There are 12 brownies in a dozen.

- Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies: \(1 \times 12 = 12\) brownies.
- She brought home 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office: \(0.5 \times 12 = 6\) brownies.
- Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies to the surprise party: \(4 \times 12 = 48\) brownies.

Now, let's add these together to find the total number of brownies Greta had initially:
\[ 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \]

Next, we need to account for the brownies eaten during the party. 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten:
\[ 1.5 \times 12 = 18 \]

Subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies:

"To determine how much Sunny earned over the two days, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold each day and then multiply by the respective prices.

First, let's define the number of boxes sold on each day:
- Let \( G_S \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday.
- Let \( A_S \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday.
- Let \( G_U \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday.
- Let \( A_U \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday.

From the problem, we know:
- \( G_S = 10 \) (gingerbread sold on Saturday)
- \( A_S = G_S - 4 \) (apple pie sold on Saturday is 4 fewer than gingerbread sold on Saturday)
- \( G_U = G_S + 5 \) (gingerbread sold on Sunday is 5 more than gingerbread sold on Saturday)
- \( A_U = 15 \) (apple pie sold on Sunday)

Now, let's calculate the number of boxes sold on each day:
- \( A_S = 10 - 4 = 6 \)
- \( G_U = 10 + 5 = 15 \)
- \( A_U = 15 \)

Next, we calculate the total earnings for each day:
- Earnings from gingerbread on Saturday: \( 10 \times 6 = 60 \)
- Earnings from apple pie on Saturday: \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \)
- Earnings from gingerbread on Sunday: \( 15 \times 6 = 90 \)
- Earnings from apple pie on Sunday: \( 15 \times 15 = 225 \)

Finally, we sum up the earnings from both days:
- Total earnings on Saturday: \( 60 + 90 = 150 \)
- Total earnings on Sunday: \( 90 + 225 = 315 \)
- Total earnings for two days: \( 150 + 315 = 465 \)

1. **Determine Emil's age when he turns 24:**
   - Emil is currently 19 years old.
   - In 5 years, Emil will be 24 years old.

2. **Determine his dad's age when Emil turns 24:**
   - When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
   - Let \( D \) be the age of Emil's dad when Emil turns 24.
   - Therefore, \( 24 = \frac{D}{2} \).
   - Solving for \( D \), we get \( D = 48 \).

3. **Determine his dad's current age:**
   - Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his dad will be 48 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, his dad's current age is \( 48 - 5 = 43 \).

"To find the combined length of time the three wolves' howls, we first need to determine the duration of each wolf's howl.

1. Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds.
3. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, which is \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Next, we add the durations of their howls to find the total time:
\[ 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60:
\[ \frac{120}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar's age: \( A = 3 \)
- Alessandro's age: \( L = 4 \)
- Helene's age: \( H \)
- Wilfred's age: \( W \)

We are given that the total age of the children is 20:
\[ A + L + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values of \( A \) and \( L \):
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

We are also given that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + L + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Thus, Wilfred's age is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's determine the total amount Walter has collected from his neighbors and the online fund. This is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Next, we need to consider the $200 donation from Walter's friend. Adding this to the total, we get $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Walter's lawyer offers to donate three times the total amount collected from all other sources. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution is 3 * $2200 = $6600.

"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies brought by the guests to the wedding reception. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies.

Total cookies = 100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies

The bride decided to give 1/2 of these cookies to the church next door.

Cookies given to the church = 1/2 * 1500 cookies = 750 cookies

If each person in the church next door received 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received.

Number of people in the church = 750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people

"To solve this problem, let's first establish the relationship between the sizes of the slices for adults and kids. Let the size of each kid's slice be \( x \). Since each adult's slice is twice as big as each kid's slice, each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

The total number of slices is the sum of the slices for the adults and the kids:
- There are 2 adults, so the total size of the adult slices is \( 2 \times 2x = 4x \).
- There are 4 kids, so the total size of the kid slices is \( 4 \times x = 4x \).

The total size of the watermelon is the sum of the sizes of all the slices:
\[ 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Each adult's slice is \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of one adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = 25\% \]

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the costs and the number of sessions per month. 

First, let's determine the total cost per session:
- The fixed cost to rent the studio is $25.
- The variable cost per student per session is $1.50, and there are 10 students.

The total variable cost per session is:
\[ 10 \text{ students} \times \$1.50 \text{ per student} = \$15 \]

So, the total cost per session is:
\[ \$25 + \$15 = \$40 \]

Next, we need to find out how many sessions are held in a month. Assuming a month has 4 weeks:
\[ 3 \text{ days per week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 12 \text{ sessions per month} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the month:
\[ 12 \text{ sessions} \times \$40 \text{ per session} = \$480 \]

Since the question asks for the expected earnings, and we have only calculated the costs, we need to clarify if there is any revenue or if the question is asking for the total expenses. Given the context, it seems the question is asking for the total expenses, which are the expected earnings in this case.

The expected earnings (or total expenses) of the dance studio in a month are:
\[ \boxed{480} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes and then find the difference.

First, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes. Peter has 4 boxes and a total of 64 chocolate bars. We can set up the equation:
\[ 4x = 64 \]
where \( x \) is the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes. Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]
So, each of Peter's boxes contains 16 chocolate bars.

Next, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes. Martha has 7 boxes and a total of 56 chocolate bars. We can set up the equation:
\[ 7y = 56 \]
where \( y \) is the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes. Solving for \( y \):
\[ y = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]
So, each of Martha's boxes contains 8 chocolate bars.

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box compared to Martha:
\[ 16 - 8 = 8 \]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of female porcupines.
2. Calculate the number of babies born each month.
3. Calculate the total number of babies born in a year.
4. Add the total number of babies born in a year to the initial population to find the final population.

Step 1: Determine the number of female porcupines.
The number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population.
\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of babies born each month.
Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
\[ \text{Babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of babies born in a year.
There are 12 months in a year.
\[ \text{Total babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume to gallons using the given conversion factor.
3. Calculate the cost based on the price per gallon.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**
The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Convert the volume to gallons.**
The conversion factor is 5.9 gallons per cubic foot.
\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 5.9 \, \text{gallons/cubic foot} \]
\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost.**
The cost is $0.10 per gallon.
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars/gallon} \]

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge of 28%.

1. **Calculate the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank before the last 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know this equals 28% of the total capacity.
   - Therefore, \( x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \).

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]
   So, the charge before the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

3. **Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank before the first 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know this equals 34.8% of the total capacity.
   - Therefore, \( y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348 \).

4. **Solve for \( y \):**
   \[
   y \times 0.59049 = 0.348
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.59049} \approx 0.589

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ 4 \times 2x + 12 \times x = 120 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 8x + 12x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \).

Thus, the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold is:

"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first calculate the total number of sandwiches each family member eats per day and then multiply by 7 (the number of days in a week).

- The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
- The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
- The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

First, we add the daily consumption:
5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day for the family.

Next, we multiply the daily total by 7 to find the weekly total:
11 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 77 sandwiches/week.

"First, calculate the total earnings from the cookies and cupcakes. Suzanne sold 80 cookies at $1 each, which totals:
\[ 80 \times 1 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

She also sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, which totals:
\[ 60 \times 4 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these amounts gives her total earnings:
\[ 80 + 240 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, she gave her two sisters $10 each, so the total amount given to her sisters is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting this from her total earnings gives the amount of money she has left:
\[ 320 - 20 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then scale it up to 40 dwarves over 30 days.

1. **Determine the amount of ore mined by one dwarf with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf mines 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
   - With an iron pickaxe, he mines twice as much: \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) pounds per day.
   - With a steel pickaxe, he mines 50% more than with an iron pickaxe: \( 24 + 0.5 \times 24 = 24 + 12 = 36 \) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves in one day:**
   - One dwarf mines 36 pounds per day with a steel pickaxe.
   - Forty dwarves will mine \( 40 \times 36 = 1440 \) pounds per day.

3. **Calculate the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves in 30 days:**
   - In 30 days, 40 dwarves will mine \( 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \) pounds of ore.

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to understand the proportional relationship between the number of sandwiches and the cost. We can see that the first package offers 2 sandwiches for $3, and the second package offers 4 sandwiches for $6. This indicates that the cost per sandwich is consistent across the packages.

First, let's calculate the cost per sandwich:
- For the first package: $3 / 2 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich
- For the second package: $6 / 4 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich

Since the cost per sandwich is $1.50, we can use this to find the cost of the third package, which contains 8 sandwiches:
- Cost of 8 sandwiches = 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst due to the wind. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst:

40% of 25 = 0.40 * 25 = 10 red balloons burst.

So, the number of red balloons remaining is:
25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. She initially had 12 yellow balloons:

Half of 12 = 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons released.

So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:
12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her clutch. First, calculate 75% of 8:

75% of 8 = 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons.

Now, let's sum up all the balloons Sally carried into the school:
- Red balloons: 15
- Green balloons: 7 (none were affected)
- Yellow balloons: 6
- Blue balloons: 6

Total number of balloons = 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34

"To determine the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the different scenarios and their probabilities:

1. **Substitute Teacher (50% chance)**: If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus won't have to turn in his homework. The probability of this scenario is 0.50.

2. **Normal Teacher (50% chance)**: If the normal teacher is present, we need to consider the following sub-scenarios:
   - **Extension for the whole class (40% chance)**: If the normal teacher gives an extension to the whole class, Marcus won't have to turn in his homework. The probability of this sub-scenario is 0.50 * 0.40 = 0.20.
   - **No extension for the whole class (60% chance)**: If the normal teacher does not give an extension to the whole class, we need to consider the personal extension scenario:
     - **Personal extension (20% chance)**: If Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment, he won't have to turn in his homework. The probability of this sub-sub-scenario is 0.50 * 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.06.
     - **No personal extension (80% chance)**: If Marcus cannot convince the teacher, he will have to turn in his homework. The probability of this sub-sub-scenario is 0.50 * 0.60 * 0.80 = 0.24.

Now, we sum up the probabilities of the scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
- Substitute teacher: 0.50
- Extension for the whole class: 0.20
- Personal extension: 0.06

The total probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework is:
0.50 + 0.20 + 0.06 = 0.76

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:
1 - 0.76 = 0.24

Converting this to a percentage:
0.24 * 100 = 24%

"To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of medium-sized jelly beans Grandpa can eat:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
   - Since he can eat 75 large jelly beans, he can eat \( 2 \times 75 = 150 \) medium-sized jelly beans.

2. **Determine the number of small jelly beans equivalent to one medium-sized jelly bean:**
   - Eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean.
   - Therefore, 1 medium-sized bean is equivalent to 3 small beans.

3. **Calculate the total number of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat:**
   - If Grandpa can eat 150 medium-sized jelly beans, and each medium-sized jelly bean is equivalent to 3 small beans, then the total number of small jelly beans he can eat is \( 150 \times 3 = 450 \).

Thus, Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans.

"To determine how long it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of soda bottles Richard will place along the driveway.
2. Determine the total time it takes for Richard to move from the first bottle to the last bottle.

First, we calculate the number of soda bottles. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard places a bottle every 3 feet. This means the number of bottles is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine the total time it takes for Richard to move from the first bottle to the last bottle. Since it takes 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next, and there are 8 bottles, Richard will move from the first bottle to the second, second to the third, and so on, until he reaches the eighth bottle. This means he will move 7 times (since he doesn't need to move after the last bottle).

The total time is:
\[ 7 \text{ moves} \times 5 \text{ seconds per move} = 35 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:
\[ 35 \text{ seconds} \]

"To determine how long it will take Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we need to calculate the total cost of his education and the income he would have earned if he had not gone to college.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the loans:**
   - Jim takes 4 years to finish college.
   - He gets $50,000 in loans per year.
   - Total loans = 4 years * $50,000/year = $200,000.

2. **Calculate the income lost from not working:**
   - Jim had a job that paid $25,000 per year.
   - He did not work for 4 years.
   - Total income lost = 4 years * $25,000/year = $100,000.

3. **Calculate the total cost of his education:**
   - Total cost = Total loans + Total income lost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

4. **Calculate Jim's new income after college:**
   - His college degree tripled his income.
   - New income = 3 * $25,000/year = $75,000/year.

5. **Calculate the net additional income per year after college:**
   - Net additional income = New income - Previous income = $75,000/year - $25,000/year = $50,000/year.

6. **Determine how long it will take to earn the total cost of his education:**
   - Time required = Total cost / Net additional income = $300,000 / $50,000/year = 6 years.

Therefore, it will take Jim 6 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we first calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces required. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

The length of each piece of fabric is:
6 feet (length of the bed) + 2 feet = 8 feet

The width of each piece of fabric is:
8 feet (width of the bed) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
8 feet (length) * 10 feet (width) = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric required is:
80 square feet (area of one piece) * 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: The post office delivered 425 letters.
2. **Tuesday**: They delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
   - One-fifth of Monday's letters: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - Tuesday's letters: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)
3. **Wednesday**: They delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.
   - Twice Tuesday's letters: \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \)
   - Wednesday's letters: \( 204 + 5 = 209 \)

Now, we sum the letters delivered over the three days:

"To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

1. On the first race, he lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. This means he won \(2 \times 5 + 1 = 11\) dollars.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. This means he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- Total lost = First race loss + Third race loss = $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

Since he won $11 in the second race, we need to subtract this from the total losses to find the net loss:
- Net loss = Total lost - Total won = $21.5 - $11 = $10.5

To find the average loss per race, we divide the net loss by the number of races:
- Average loss = Net loss / Number of races = $10.5 / 3 = $3.5

- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:

\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:

\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:

\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we know the number of balls retrieved in the second set is 6. To find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

"To find out how many movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we first need to determine the total number of movies they watch in one weekend.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies.
On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is \(4 / 2 = 2\) movies.

So, in one weekend, they watch \(4 + 2 = 6\) movies.

Since there are 4 weekends in a month, the total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks is \(6 \times 4 = 24\).

"To find out how many stickers Leo has in his collection now, we need to add the stickers he collected over the past years to his initial collection.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
Last year, he added 50 stickers to his collection, bringing the total to:
100 + 50 = 150 stickers.

This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers he collected last year. Since he collected 50 stickers last year, this year he collected:
2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Adding this year's stickers to his collection, we get:
150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

Therefore, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection now.

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to calculate the total amount of food consumed per day and then see how many days the total supply will last.

1. Calculate the total amount of food consumed per feeding:
   - Each cat eats 60 grams per feeding.
   - There are 3 cats.
   - Total food per feeding = 60 grams/cat * 3 cats = 180 grams.

2. Calculate the total amount of food consumed per day:
   - The cats are fed twice a day.
   - Total food per day = 180 grams/feeding * 2 feedings/day = 360 grams/day.

3. Determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last:
   - Total food supply = 720 grams.
   - Days the food will last = 720 grams / 360 grams/day = 2 days.

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the number of slices each person ate in terms of the number of slices Jake ate. Let's denote the number of slices Jake ate as \( J \).

From the problem, we know:
- Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so Becky ate \( J + 3 \) slices.
- Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \( 2J \) slices.
- Becky ate 10 slices, so \( J + 3 = 10 \).

First, solve for \( J \):
\[ J + 3 = 10 \]
\[ J = 10 - 3 \]
\[ J = 7 \]

Now, we know:
- Jake ate 7 slices.
- Becky ate 10 slices.
- Silvia ate \( 2J = 2 \times 7 = 14 \) slices.

Next, calculate the total number of slices they ate:
\[ \text{Total slices} = J + (J + 3) + 2J \]
\[ \text{Total slices} = 7 + 10 + 14 \]
\[ \text{Total slices} = 31 \]

Therefore, the total number of slices they ate is 31.

"Let's denote the time Donovan spent on his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time spent on the meal is the sum of the times spent by Betsy and Donovan, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, therefore, took:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Thus, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to add up the costs for the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking.

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The cost of the visit is $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit, which is 0.5 hours. So, the visit costs $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. The cost of the painkillers is $4 per pill for 30 pills, which totals $4 * 30 = $120.
4. The cost of the parking is $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours, which totals $6 * 2 = $12.

Adding these together:
$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482.

   - Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons.
   - Number of small coupons = 700
   - Number of big coupons = 2 * 700 = 1400

2. Calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons:
   - Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail.
   - Total cost for small coupons = 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents

3. Calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons:
   - Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail.
   - Total cost for big coupons = 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents

4. Add the costs together to find the total cost:
   - Total cost = 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents

5. Convert the total cost from cents to dollars (if needed):

"To determine the cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter, we first need to understand the promotion and how it applies to his purchase.

1. **Butter Requirement**: Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter.
2. **Promotion**: The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter purchased at full price, the next pound is half price.

Let's break down the purchase:
- For the first pound, he pays full price: $4.00.
- For the second pound, he pays half price: $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
- For the third pound, he pays full price: $4.00.
- For the fourth pound, he pays half price: $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
- For the fifth pound, he pays full price: $4.00.
- For the sixth pound, he pays half price: $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
- Full price pounds: 3 pounds * $4.00 = $12.00
- Half price pounds: 3 pounds * $2.00 = $6.00

Total cost = $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00

"First, let's calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class during a normal school day. Since there are 6 periods and he has 2 extra classes, he has a total of 8 classes per day. Each class is 40 minutes long, so:

\[ 8 \text{ classes/day} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of minutes he spends in class over the 5 school days:

\[ 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

John also spends extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday. He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly class time on each of these days. First, we find \(\frac{1}{16}\) of 1600 minutes:

\[ \frac{1600 \text{ minutes}}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he spends this amount of time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time over the weekend is:

\[ 100 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the extra learning time to the total class time to get the total weekly learning time:

\[ 1600 \text{ minutes/week} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Finally, we convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours:

"To find out how much the orchard earned, we first need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag:

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. This means that before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 kilograms of meat left.
2. The velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex. Therefore, the 270 kilograms is half of what was left after the T-Rex. So, before the velociraptors ate, there were \(270 \times 2 = 540\) kilograms of meat.
3. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. Therefore, the 540 kilograms is half of the original amount of meat on the triceratops. So, the original amount of meat on the triceratops was \(540 \times 2 = 1080\) kilograms.

Thus, the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.

"To determine the cost to paint the room, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

1. Calculate the area of the north and south walls:
   - Each wall is 10 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet.
   - Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls = 2 * 80 square feet = 160 square feet.

2. Calculate the area of the east and west walls:
   - Each wall is 5 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet.
   - Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls = 2 * 40 square feet = 80 square feet.

3. Calculate the total area of all four walls:
   - Total area = 160 square feet (north and south) + 80 square feet (east and west) = 240 square feet.

4. Determine the number of gallons of paint needed:
   - One gallon of paint covers 20 square feet.
   - Number of gallons needed = Total area / Coverage per gallon = 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons.

5. Calculate the total cost:
   - Cost per gallon = $12.
   - Total cost = Number of gallons * Cost per gallon = 12 gallons * $12 = $144.

The total cost to paint the room is $144.

"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability that the friend picks a shaken can from the remaining sodas.

Initially, there are 12 sodas, with 3 of them shaken. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda, leaving 11 sodas (3 shaken and 8 unshaken). Ellen's brother then takes 1 shaken and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 10 sodas in total (2 shaken and 8 unshaken).

The probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken can from the remaining 10 sodas is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of remaining sodas:

\[ P(\text{shaken can}) = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of remaining sodas}} = \frac{2}{10} = 0.2 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

"To determine how many people Billy helps, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy takes off.
3. Calculate the number of days Billy works.
4. Calculate the total number of people he helps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.

Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy takes off.**

Billy takes 20% of the days off.

Number of days off = 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days

**Step 3: Calculate the number of days Billy works.**

Number of days Billy works = Total days - Days off = 50 - 10 = 40 days

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of people he helps.**

Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day.

People helped per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day

Total people helped = Number of days worked * People helped per day = 40 days * 6 people/day = 240 people

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times the distance Amber ran, we calculate:

Micah's distance = 3.5 * Amber's distance
Micah's distance = 3.5 * 8 miles
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Next, we add the distances run by Amber and Micah to find the total distance they both ran:

Total distance by Amber and Micah = Amber's distance + Micah's distance
Total distance by Amber and Micah = 8 miles + 28 miles
Total distance by Amber and Micah = 36 miles

Since the total distance run by all three is 52 miles, we can find Ahito's distance by subtracting the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the overall total:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - Total distance by Amber and Micah
Ahito's distance = 52 miles - 36 miles
Ahito's distance = 16 miles

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let the total number of jellyfish in the tank be \( x \).
2. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{x}{5} \).
3. A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{x}{5} = \frac{x}{15} \).
4. We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, \( \frac{x}{15} = 6 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{15} = 6 \]
\[ x = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ x = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

"To find the number of girls in the school, we first need to determine the total population of the school. Since 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys, we can set up the equation:

40% of total population = 240 boys

Let's convert 40% to a decimal for easier calculation:

40% = 0.40

So, 0.40 * total population = 240

To find the total population, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:

Total population = 240 / 0.40
Total population = 600

Now that we know the total population of the school is 600, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population:

Number of girls = Total population - Number of boys
Number of girls = 600 - 240
Number of girls = 360

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her 9,300-mile journey in June, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June and the total miles she plans to hike daily.

June has 30 days. If Soledad hikes 125 miles twice a day, she will hike:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/hike} \times 2 \text{ hikes/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total miles she will hike in June at this rate:
\[ 250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7,500 \text{ miles} \]

Soledad's goal is to hike 9,300 miles. The additional miles she needs to hike are:
\[ 9,300 \text{ miles} - 7,500 \text{ miles} = 1,800 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we divide the additional miles by the number of days in June:

"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers:**
   - 2 workers produce 6 toys per hour each.
   - 2 workers produce 4 toys per hour each.
   - Each worker works for 10 hours.

   For the first 2 workers:
   \[
   2 \text{ workers} \times 6 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ toys}
   \]

   For the next 2 workers:
   \[
   2 \text{ workers} \times 4 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 80 \text{ toys}
   \]

   Total toys produced by the first 4 workers:

"Let's denote the number of stickers Seth originally had as \( S \).

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
3. Luis gave the remaining half of the stickers to Kris, so Kris received \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
4. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. Therefore, Kris had \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers in total.

Since Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers, we can set up the equation:

"First, let's calculate the total number of M&M's John has. Each large bag weighs 10 ounces, and there are 3 large bags. Since each ounce contains 30 M&M's, we can calculate the total number of M&M's as follows:

\[ \text{Total M&M's} = 3 \text{ bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per bag} \times 30 \text{ M&M's per ounce} \]

\[ \text{Total M&M's} = 3 \times 10 \times 30 = 900 \text{ M&M's} \]

Next, we need to determine how many small bags John can make if he puts 10 M&M's in each small bag:

\[ \text{Number of small bags} = \frac{\text{Total M&M's}}{\text{M&M's per small bag}} \]

\[ \text{Number of small bags} = \frac{900}{10} = 90 \]

So, John can make 90 small bags.

"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we first need to determine what half the circumference of the earth is. The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers, so half of that is:

40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:

20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days

"To find out how fast the fastest car goes, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. The average car can go 120 miles per hour.
2. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.
   - Speed of the 2nd fastest car = 5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour.
3. The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.
   - Speed of the fastest car = 1.25 * 600 = 750 miles per hour.

Therefore, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. 

Let \( V \) represent Vince's age two years ago. According to the problem, two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. Liam is currently 16 years old, so two years ago, Liam was 14 years old. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 14 = 2V \]

To find \( V \), we solve for \( V \):

\[ V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

This means Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

\[ V + 2 = 7 + 2 = 9 \]

So, Vince is currently 9 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total eggs painted by all four:**
   \[
   A + M + C + S = 56
   \]

2. **Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs:**
   \[
   A = M
   \]

3. **Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs:**
   \[
   C + S = 30
   \]

4. **Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah:**
   \[
   C = S + 12
   \]

First, substitute \( C = S + 12 \) into the equation \( C + S = 30 \):
\[
(S + 12) + S = 30
\]
\[
2S + 12 = 30
\]
\[
2S = 18
\]
\[
S = 9
\]

Now, substitute \( S = 9 \) back into \( C = S + 12 \):
\[
C = 9 + 12
\]
\[
C = 21
\]

So, Camden painted 21 eggs and Sarah painted 9 eggs.

Next, we know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56:
\[
A + M + C + S = 56
\]
\[
A + A + 21 + 9 = 56
\]
\[
2A + 30 = 56
\]
\[
2A = 26
\]
\[
A = 13
\]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs and Madeline also painted 13 eggs.

Finally, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[
C - A = 21 - 13
\]
\[
C - A = 8
\]

Thus, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from 200 crayons.
2. Calculate the total number of boxes needed.
3. Calculate the total weight of the crayons.
4. Calculate the total weight of the boxes.
5. Add the total weight of the crayons and the boxes.
6. Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds.

Step 1: Determine the number of groups of 8 crayons.
\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total number of boxes needed.
Since each group of 8 crayons goes into one box, the number of boxes is equal to the number of groups.
\[ \text{Number of boxes} = 25 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total weight of the crayons.
\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Step 4: Calculate the total weight of the boxes.
\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Step 5: Add the total weight of the crayons and the boxes.
\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Step 6: Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds.
\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Step 1: Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns. Therefore, her brother earns:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Step 2: Their combined salary is:
\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Step 3: Their mother earns twice their combined salary:
\[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time Grandma spends walking, given the different speeds on the beach and the sidewalk.

First, let's find Grandma's speed on the beach. Since she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, her speed on the beach is:
\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

Next, we need to find her speed on the sidewalk. According to the problem, she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we calculate the time it takes for her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:
\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ 50 \text{ minutes} \]

"To determine how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has already saved. Jane saves $4 every week, and she has been saving for 8 weeks.

Total saved so far = $4/week * 8 weeks = $32

Next, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60.

Amount needed = $60 - $32 = $28

Since Jane saves $4 each week, we can find out how many more weeks she needs to save by dividing the amount needed by the amount she saves per week.

Number of weeks needed = $28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many marbles Bob initially has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. Therefore, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles.

Let \( x \) be the number of marbles Bob initially has. According to the problem, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles. Now, if Bob loses 10 marbles, the number of marbles he will have is:
\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug such that the mixture in Donny's water bottle is at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug.
- The temperature of the water in the first mug is 33 degrees.
- Donny mixes 4 ounces of 33-degree water with 1 ounce of \( T \)-degree water.

The total amount of water in the mixture is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces.

The temperature of the mixture can be calculated using the weighted average formula:
\[
\text{Mixture Temperature} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

We know that the mixture temperature must be at least 40 degrees:
\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):
\[
4 \times 33 = 132
\]

Substitute this into the inequality:
\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:
\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T \):
\[
T \geq 68
\]

Thus, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is 68 degrees.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of scoops Gomer ate:**
   Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   \[
   23 - 5 = 18 \text{ scoops}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of potatoes needed for a certain number of scoops:**
   It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   \[
   6 - 3 = 3 \text{ potatoes}

   So, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. **Calculate the number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   We need to find out how many sets of 2 scoops are in 18 scoops.
   \[
   \frac{18 \text{ scoops}}{2 \text{ scoops/set}} = 9 \text{ sets}
   \]
   Since each set requires 3 potatoes:
   \[
   9 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ potatoes/set} = 27 \text{ potatoes}

"To determine the total number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to consider both the individual sunflowers and the sunflowers included in the bouquets.

First, calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day:
- Each individual sunflower costs $2.
- Faraday earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers per day.
- The number of individual sunflowers sold per day is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \).

Next, calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
- Each bouquet costs $8.
- Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets per day.
- The number of bouquets sold per day is \( \frac{56}{8} = 7 \).

Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, so the number of sunflowers sold in bouquets per day is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of babies in each color group:**
   - Carla has 8 identical octuplets.
   - \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the babies are dressed in purple: 
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ babies in purple}
     \]
   - \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the babies are dressed in blue:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ babies in blue}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of babies wearing bows:**
   - All 2 babies in blue wear bows.
   - \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the 6 babies in purple wear bows:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ babies in purple wearing bows}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of babies wearing bows:**
   - Total babies wearing bows = babies in blue wearing bows + babies in purple wearing bows:
     \[
     2 + 2 = 4 \text{ babies wearing bows}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of babies wearing both a bow and purple:**
   - From the previous step, 2 babies in purple are wearing bows.

5. **Calculate the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:**
   - The probability is the number of babies wearing both a bow and purple divided by the total number of babies wearing bows:
     \[
     \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
     \]

6. **Convert the probability to a percentage:**
   - \( 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \)

Therefore, the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is:

"To determine the total amount of money Abraham will earn after selling all his unused land, we need to break down the sales step by step.

1. **Initial Land Area:**
   Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.

2. **First Sale:**
   He sold half of the land for $50.
   - Half of 80 square meters is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.
   - After this sale, he has \( 80 - 40 = 40 \) square meters left.

3. **Second Sale:**
   He sold another 1/4 of his remaining land for $30.
   - 1/4 of 40 square meters is \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) square meters.
   - After this sale, he has \( 40 - 10 = 30 \) square meters left.

4. **Third Sale:**
   He sold the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter.
   - The total amount from this sale is \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars.

5. **Total Earnings:**
   - From the first sale: $50
   - From the second sale: $30
   - From the third sale: $90

   Adding these amounts together gives:
   \[
   50 + 30 + 90 = 170

"To find out how much money John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
2. Calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.
3. Calculate the total number of collections he makes in a week.
4. Calculate his total earnings based on the number of collections and the rate per collection.

Step 1: Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
- The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.
- The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two, so it has 400 * 0.60 = 240 more apartments.
- Therefore, the third complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of apartments.
- Total apartments = 200 (first complex) + 200 (second complex) + 640 (third complex) = 1040 apartments.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of collections he makes in a week.
- He collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, so total collections = 1040 apartments * 3 times/week = 3120 collections/week.

Step 4: Calculate his total earnings.
- He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so total earnings = 3120 collections * $0.40/collection = $1248.

Therefore, John makes $1248 in a week.

"To find the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree**: 50 fruits
2. **6-year-old tree**: 3 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
3. **7-year-old tree**: 7 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
4. **8-year-old tree**: 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. First, we need to find the number of fruits produced by a 10-year-old tree.
5. **10-year-old tree**: 20 times the initial amount (50 fruits) = 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits
6. **8-year-old tree**: 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits
7. **9-year-old tree**: 0 fruits (as stated, it doesn't produce any fruit)

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters. According to the problem, the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.

The combined length of the three ropes is given as 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 4B + B + B + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ B = 5 \]

Now, we know the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters. The length of the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Thus, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5C + 35}{3} \]
Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]
Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]
Divide by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the usage and orders of bandages over the three days and work backwards to find out how many bandages they started with.

1. **First Day:**
   - Used 38 bandages.
   - Ordered 1 bulk pack (50 bandages).

2. **Second Day:**
   - Used 10 fewer bandages than the first day: \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - Ordered 2 bulk packs (2 * 50 = 100 bandages).
   - Used half a pack: \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
   - Had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

Let's calculate the total number of bandages used and ordered over the three days:

- **Total bandages used:**
  - First day: 38
  - Second day: 28
  - Third day: 25
  - Total used: \(38 + 28 + 25 = 91\) bandages.

- **Total bandages ordered:**
  - First day: 50
  - Third day: 100
  - Total ordered: \(50 + 100 = 150\) bandages.

Now, let's determine the initial number of bandages:
- At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left.
- The total bandages they had at the end of the third day before using any would be the bandages left plus the bandages used on the third day: \(78 + 25 = 103\) bandages.
- Before the third day, they had \(103 - 100 = 3\) bandages (since they ordered 100 bandages on the third day).
- Before the second day, they had \(3 + 28 = 31\) bandages (since they used 28 bandages on the second day).
- Before the first day, they had \(31 + 38 = 69\) bandages (since they used 38 bandages on the first day).

Therefore, they started with 69 bandages on the first day.

"To find the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut based on the length of hair cut off and add the cost of the color.

1. The cost of the color is a flat rate of $40.
2. The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch of hair cut off. May's hair was reduced from 10 inches to 8 inches, so 2 inches were cut off.

The cost of the haircut is:
2 inches * $30/inch = $60

Adding the cost of the color:
$60 (haircut) + $40 (color) = $100

The total cost for May's cut and color is:

"To find out how much Jen will receive for April, we need to calculate her earnings from her hourly work and her additional attendance bonus.

First, calculate her weekly earnings from her hourly work:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week, so she works \(7.5 \times 6 = 45\) hours a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her weekly earnings from her hourly work are \(45 \times 1.5 = 67.5\) dollars.

Next, calculate her monthly earnings from her hourly work:
- There are 4 weeks in April, so her monthly earnings from her hourly work are \(67.5 \times 4 = 270\) dollars.

Now, add the attendance bonus:
- Jen receives an additional $10 for complete attendance each week, and since there are 4 weeks in April, her total attendance bonus is \(10 \times 4 = 40\) dollars.

Finally, add her monthly earnings from her hourly work and her attendance bonus:
- Total earnings for April = \(270 + 40 = 310\) dollars.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens.
2. Each pack contains 5 pens, so the total number of red pens is:
   \[
   5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens}
   \]

3. She also bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens. Since she bought 5 packs of red pens, she bought:
   \[
   2 \times 5 \text{ packs} = 10 \text{ packs of black pens}
   \]

4. Each pack of black pens also contains 5 pens, so the total number of black pens is:
   \[
   10 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 50 \text{ black pens}
   \]

5. To find the total number of pens, we add the number of red pens and black pens:
   \[
   25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of pens Alain has is:

"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles for a total of $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch:
\[ \text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + (0.5 \times 60) = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the cognac:
\[ \text{Total cost for cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac to find the total amount John spends:
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
   - He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees. Therefore, he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

2. **Second Day:**
   - He planted 10 more White Oak trees, so the total number of White Oak trees planted on the second day is \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
   - He planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he did on the first day. The number of additional Lodgepole Pine trees is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\). Therefore, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is \(40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

3. **Total Trees Planted:**
   - Total White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\)

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the jar.
2. Determine the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans.
3. Calculate the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar.
4. Estimate the number of red jelly beans based on the given percentage.
5. Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.**

The jar is a rectangular prism with a square base:
- Base area = 6 inches * 6 inches = 36 square inches
- Height = 15 inches

Volume of the jar = Base area * Height = 36 square inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches

**Step 2: Determine the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans.**

The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans is:
Effective volume = 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar.**

Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches:
Total number of jelly beans = Effective volume / Volume per jelly bean = 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches per jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans

**Step 4: Estimate the number of red jelly beans.**

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red:
Estimated number of red jelly beans = 2880 jelly beans * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans

**Step 5: Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.**

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between Tim's estimate and the true number is:
Difference = |900 - 864| = 36

Therefore, Tim's guess was off by 36 red jelly beans.

"To determine how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning he will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pounds of ground beef required to make 80 meatballs.
2. Determine the amount of seasoning needed based on the number of pounds of ground beef.

First, we know that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef. To find out how many pounds of ground beef are needed for 80 meatballs, we use the proportion:
\[ \text{Number of pounds} = \frac{\text{Total meatballs}}{\text{Meatballs per pound}} = \frac{80}{16} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 5 pounds of ground beef, the amount of seasoning needed is:
\[ \text{Total seasoning} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

Thus, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning.

"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call with the given pricing structure, we need to break it down into two parts: the cost for the first 16 minutes and the cost for the remaining minutes.

1. **Cost for the first 16 minutes:**
   - The rate is $0.25 per minute.
   - Total cost for 16 minutes = 16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

2. **Cost for the remaining 20 minutes:**
   - The rate drops to $0.20 per minute after 16 minutes.
   - Total cost for 20 minutes = 20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00

3. **Total cost for the 36-minute call:**
   - Total cost = Cost for the first 16 minutes + Cost for the remaining 20 minutes
   - Total cost = $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( c \) represent the number of cupcakes Carly makes.
Let \( b \) represent the number of brownies Carly makes.

From the problem, we know:
1. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be written as:
   \[
   b = 3c - 2
   \]

2. Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
   \[
   5 \times 2 = 10
   \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and the number of brownies:
\[
c + b = 10
\]

Now, substitute the expression for \( b \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
c + (3c - 2) = 10
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
4c - 2 = 10
\]

Add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( c \):
\[
4c = 12
\]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( c \):
\[
c = 3
\]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount. The total cost without the discount is $35 (manicure) + $40 (pedicure) = $75. 

The discount is 20% of $75, which is 0.20 * $75 = $15. 

So, the discounted price for both services is $75 - $15 = $60.

Next, we calculate the cost of the nail art. Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, which totals 10 nails. The cost for nail art is $3 per nail, so for 10 nails, it is 10 * $3 = $30.

Adding the cost of the nail art to the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure gives us $60 + $30 = $90.

Therefore, Karen would pay $90 in all.

2. The 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
   \(1 \times 6 = 6\) issues

3. The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
   \(4 \times 6 = 24\) issues

Adding these together gives the total number of issues per year:
\(36 + 6 + 24 = 66\)

Now, we solve for \( K \):
\[
K + 8 - 12 = 27
\]
\[
K - 4 = 27
\]
\[
K = 27 + 4
\]
\[
K = 31

"To find the final price of the toy after the changes in December and January, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the price in December:**
   - The price in November was $40.
   - The price increased by 80% in December.
   - An 80% increase means the price in December is 180% of the November price.
   - \( 180\% \) of $40 is calculated as \( 1.80 \times 40 = 72 \).

2. **Calculate the price in January:**
   - The price in December was $72.
   - The price decreased by 50% in January.
   - A 50% decrease means the price in January is 50% of the December price.
   - \( 50\% \) of $72 is calculated as \( 0.50 \times 72 = 36 \).

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36.

\[ \text{Remaining apples} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Next, Walter gave 25% of the remaining apples to his sister:

\[ \text{Apples given to sister} = 0.25 \times 36 = 9 \]

So, the number of apples left after giving some to his sister is:

\[ \text{Remaining apples after giving to sister} = 36 - 9 = 27 \]

Walter then sold these 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each:

\[ \text{Money received} = 27 \times 3 = 81 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Identify the cost of the main phone: $20.
2. Determine the cost of each additional phone. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, each additional phone costs $20 / 2 = $10.
3. Calculate the total cost for the additional phones. There are 4 additional phones, so the total cost for these is 4 * $10 = $40.
4. Add the cost of the main phone to the total cost of the additional phones to get the total cost of the phone plan: $20 + $40 = $60.

Therefore, the whole phone plan costs $60.

"To determine the total number of lemons Tim will need, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. Calculate the number of lemons needed for the 4 gallons of regular lemonade.
2. Calculate the number of lemons needed for the 1 gallon of extra-tart lemonade.
3. Add the two amounts together to get the total number of lemons.

### Step 1: Regular Lemonade
- 1 gallon of lemonade requires 1 cup of lemon juice.
- 4 gallons of lemonade will require \(4 \times 1 = 4\) cups of lemon juice.
- 6 lemons yield 1 cup of lemon juice.
- Therefore, 4 cups of lemon juice will require \(4 \times 6 = 24\) lemons.

### Step 2: Extra-Tart Lemonade
- 1 gallon of extra-tart lemonade is twice as tart, so it requires 2 cups of lemon juice.
- 6 lemons yield 1 cup of lemon juice.
- Therefore, 2 cups of lemon juice will require \(2 \times 6 = 12\) lemons.

### Step 3: Total Lemons
- Total lemons needed = lemons for regular lemonade + lemons for extra-tart lemonade
- Total lemons needed = 24 + 12 = 36

Thus, Tim will need 36 lemons in total.

"To find out how much Ellen and Lani spent in all, we need to add up the costs of the items they each bought.

Ellen's purchases:
- A pair of leggings for $100
- A photo frame for $5

Total for Ellen = $100 + $5 = $105

Lani's purchases:
- A pair of sunglasses for $30
- Two bathrobes at $100 each

Total for Lani = $30 + ($100 * 2) = $30 + $200 = $230

Total spent by Ellen and Lani = Ellen's total + Lani's total = $105 + $230 = $335

"To calculate the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his special honey and jam mix, we first need to determine the cost to produce one jar and then the total cost for 10 jars. After that, we can calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars and finally the profit.

1. **Calculate the cost to produce one jar:**
   - Cost of passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
   - Cost of jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
   - Cost of honey: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20
   - Total cost for one jar = $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

2. **Calculate the total cost for 10 jars:**
   - Total cost for 10 jars = 10 * $44 = $440

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars:**
   - Revenue from 10 jars = 10 * $50 = $500

4. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Profit = $500 - $440 = $60

"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and then sum these values.

1. **Quarters**: Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - \( 32 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 8 \text{ dollars} \)

2. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth $0.10.
   - \( 95 \text{ dimes} \times 0.10 \text{ dollars/dime} = 9.50 \text{ dollars} \)

3. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth $0.05.
   - \( 120 \text{ nickels} \times 0.05 \text{ dollars/nickel} = 6 \text{ dollars} \)

4. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth $0.01.
   - \( 750 \text{ pennies} \times 0.01 \text{ dollars/penny} = 7.50 \text{ dollars} \)

Now, we sum the values of all the coins:
- \( 8 \text{ dollars} + 9.50 \text{ dollars} + 6 \text{ dollars} + 7.50 \text{ dollars} = 31 \text{ dollars} \)

Thus, the total dollar amount in the jar is:

"To find out how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days Josh works in a week.
2. Determine the number of cars he services in a week.
3. Calculate his weekly earnings.
4. Double the weekly earnings to find out his earnings for 2 weeks.

Step 1: Josh is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday, so he works 5 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday).

Step 2: He services 3 cars a day, so in a week, he services:
5 days * 3 cars/day = 15 cars

Step 3: He gets paid $4 per car, so his weekly earnings are:
15 cars * $4/car = $60

Step 4: To find out how much he makes in 2 weeks, we double his weekly earnings:
$60 * 2 = $120

Therefore, Josh makes $120 in 2 weeks.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation:**
   - The dog digs 6 holes per day.
   - Nate is on vacation for 14 days.
   - Total holes dug = 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.

2. **Determine the net number of holes filled each day after Nate returns:**
   - Nate fills 9 holes per day.
   - The dog digs 6 new holes each night.
   - Net holes filled per day = 9 holes/day - 6 holes/night = 3 holes/day.

3. **Calculate the number of days it takes to fill all the holes:**
   - Total holes to fill = 84 holes.
   - Net holes filled per day = 3 holes/day.
   - Number of days to fill all holes = 84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days.

4. **Convert the number of days into weeks:**
   - 1 week = 7 days.
   - Number of weeks = 28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks.

Thus, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School. 

Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School, and Norman High School enrolls 4000 students, we can calculate Butler High School's enrollment as follows:

\[ \text{Butler High School enrollment} = 4000 \times \frac{3}{4} = 3000 \]

Next, we find the difference in enrollment between the two schools:

\[ \text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000 \]

Thus, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and set up equations based on the items Igor actually gathered.

1. **Test Tubes**: Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many. Therefore, Igor gathered:
   \[
   \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ test tubes}
   \]

2. **Petri Dishes**: Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested. Therefore, Igor gathered:
   \[
   14 + 2 = 16 \text{ Petri dishes}
   \]

3. **Beakers**: Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, and Igor gathered the correct number initially but lost some. Let \( x \) be the number of beakers Igor lost. Therefore, the number of beakers Igor placed on the lab bench is:
   \[
   7 - x
   \]

4. **Total Items**: The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench is 29. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
   \[
   8 \text{ (test tubes)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} = 29
   \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[
8 + 16 + 7 - x = 29

"To determine how many screws James will have left over, we first need to calculate the total number of screws required for the 4 tables.

1. Each table has 4 legs.
2. Each leg needs 2 screws.
3. Therefore, each table requires \(4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws}\).

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is:
\[4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws}\]

James has 40 screws in total. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the number of screws used from the total number of screws:
\[40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws}\]

So, the number of screws James will have left over is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the distance Aaron ran:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles, and she ran twice as far as Aaron.
   - Therefore, Aaron ran \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.

2. **Determine Aaron's speed:**
   - Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.
   - Therefore, Aaron's speed is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \).

3. **Determine Vanessa's speed:**
   - Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
   - Therefore, Vanessa's speed is \( 2 \times 8 \text{ minutes per mile} = 16 \text{ minutes per mile} \).

4. **Calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:**
   - Vanessa's speed is 16 minutes per mile.
   - Therefore, the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles is \( 4 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 64 \text{ minutes} \).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in one hour and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- The number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour is \( \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges} \).

Next, let's calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- The number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour is \( \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges} \).

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- Difference = Number of oranges Ana peels - Number of oranges Jane peels
- Difference = 20 oranges - 15 oranges = 5 oranges

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of chickens as \( c \) and the number of cows as \( k \).

1. Each chicken has 2 legs, and each cow has 4 legs.
2. The total number of animals is 20.
3. The total number of legs is 70.

We can write the following equations:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
\[ c + k = 20 \]
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Next, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( c \):
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.
