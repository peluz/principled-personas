"To determine the total number of bolts needed for a robe, we need to calculate the amount of blue fiber and white fiber required and then sum them up.

1. The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. The robe requires half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Therefore, the amount of white fiber needed is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ bolt}
   \]

Adding the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together:
\[
2 \text{ bolts (blue)} + 1 \text{ bolt (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts}
\]

Thus, the total number of bolts needed for the robe is:

"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair costs) from the new value to find the profit.

First, let's find the new value of the house. The repairs increased the value by 150%. This means the new value is 250% of the original value (100% original value + 150% increase).

The original value of the house is $80,000. 

\[ \text{New value} = 80,000 \times 2.5 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the house and the repairs:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Now, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value:

\[ \text{Profit} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, Josh's profit is:

70,000"
"To find out how many total meters James runs a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the total distance James runs in one session:
   - He runs 3 sprints, and each sprint is 60 meters.
   - So, in one session, he runs \(3 \times 60 = 180\) meters.

2. Calculate the total distance he runs in a week:
   - He runs 3 times a week.
   - So, in one week, he runs \(3 \times 180 = 540\) meters.

Therefore, the total distance James runs in a week is 540 meters.

"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken needs per day:
   Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day.

2. Calculate the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock per day:
   Total feed needed = Number of chickens × Feed per chicken per day
   Total feed needed = 20 chickens × 3 cups/chicken
   Total feed needed = 60 cups

3. Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:
   Morning feed = 15 cups
   Afternoon feed = 25 cups
   Total feed given = Morning feed + Afternoon feed
   Total feed given = 15 cups + 25 cups
   Total feed given = 40 cups

4. Calculate the amount of feed needed for the final meal:
   Feed needed for final meal = Total feed needed - Total feed given
   Feed needed for final meal = 60 cups - 40 cups
   Feed needed for final meal = 20 cups

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of 16 glasses, where every second glass is sold at a 60% discount.

1. The cost of the first glass is $5.
2. The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.
3. This pattern repeats for every pair of glasses.

Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, we can divide the total number of glasses by 2 to find the number of pairs:
\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

Each pair consists of one full-price glass and one discounted glass:
- Cost of one full-price glass: $5
- Cost of one discounted glass: $3

The total cost for one pair of glasses is:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Since there are 8 pairs, the total cost for 16 glasses is:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay:
\[ 64 \]

"Let's denote the number of sheep in Seattle as \( S \), in Charleston as \( C \), and in Toulouse as \( T \).

Given:
- Seattle has 20 sheep, so \( S = 20 \).
- Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so \( C = 4S \).
- Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so \( T = 2C \).

First, calculate the number of sheep in Charleston:
\[ C = 4S = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Next, calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse:
\[ T = 2C = 2 \times 80 = 160 \]

Now, sum the number of sheep in all three cities:
\[ S + C + T = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 \]

The total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into the different stages of the download process and the interruption.

1. **Initial Download Phase:**
   - Carla is downloading a 200 GB file at a rate of 2 GB/minute.
   - 40% of the way through the download is \( 0.40 \times 200 \) GB = 80 GB.
   - The time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Windows Restart:**
   - The Windows update forces a restart, which takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarted Download:**
   - After the restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning.
   - The total time to download the entire 200 GB file is \( \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \).

4. **Total Time:**
   - The total time is the sum of the initial download time, the restart time, and the restarted download time.
   - Total time = 40 minutes (initial download) + 20 minutes (restart) + 100 minutes (restarted download) = 160 minutes.

Thus, the total time it takes to download the file is 160 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the distances John travels in each segment of his journey.

1. **Initial Trip:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles in this time.
   - For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - For the remaining 1.5 hours (since the total return trip is 4 hours and he has already spent 2.5 hours), he drives at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Covered on the Return Trip:**
   - Total distance = 0 miles (standstill) + 15 miles (30 mph) + 120 miles (80 mph) = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - John initially traveled 180 miles away from home.
   - He then traveled 135 miles back towards home.
   - Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

Therefore, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to consider both her regular pay and her overtime pay.

1. **Regular Pay Calculation:**
   - Eliza's regular rate is $10 per hour.
   - She works 40 hours at this rate.
   - Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Pay Calculation:**
   - Overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - She worked 45 hours in total, so the number of overtime hours is 45 - 40 = 5 hours.
   - Overtime pay = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460.

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460.

   - Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit per year and see when the total profit exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: $90
2. **Annual Revenue**: 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5
3. **Annual Cost**: $3

**Net Annual Profit**:
\[ \text{Net Annual Profit} = \text{Annual Revenue} - \text{Annual Cost} \]
\[ \text{Net Annual Profit} = \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5 \]

**Total Profit After \( n \) Years**:
\[ \text{Total Profit} = \text{Net Annual Profit} \times n - \text{Initial Cost} \]
\[ \text{Total Profit} = 7.5n - 90 \]

We need to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that the total profit is greater than or equal to zero:
\[ 7.5n - 90 \geq 0 \]
\[ 7.5n \geq 90 \]
\[ n \geq \frac{90}{7.5} \]
\[ n \geq 12 \]

Therefore, it will take Carlos 12 years to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there.
2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so the number of vacuum cleaners left after the green and red houses is \( x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 \).
3. At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners.
4. After the orange house, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left.

We can set up the equation based on the information given:
\[ x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
\[ x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 = \frac{3x}{3} - \frac{x}{3} - 2 = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \]

Now, substitute this back into the equation:
\[ x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Simplify the term \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \):
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2x}{3} - \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 = \frac{x}{3} - 1 \]

Substitute this back into the equation:
\[ x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 - \left( \frac{x}{3} - 1 \right) = 5 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ x - \frac{x}{3} - \frac{x}{3} - 2 + 1 = 5 \]
\[ x - \frac{2x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]

Combine the \( x \) terms:
\[ \frac{3x}{3} - \frac{2x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]

Add 1 to both sides:
\[ \frac{x}{3} = 6 \]

Multiply both sides by 3:
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs Claire uses per day.
2. Determine the total number of days in 4 weeks.
3. Calculate the total number of eggs used in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Claire uses 3 eggs per day.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are:
\[ 4 \times 7 = 28 \text{ days} \]

Step 3: The total number of eggs used in 4 weeks is:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Step 4: Convert the total number of eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we first need to calculate the total time she should take to complete the 12-mile trail.

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given:
- Total Distance = 12 miles
- Desired Average Speed = 4 miles per hour

We can rearrange the formula to solve for Total Time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 2 hours hiking the first 6 miles. Therefore, the remaining time she has to complete the trail is:
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = \text{Total Time} - \text{Time Already Spent} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance she needs to cover is:
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the required speed for the remaining distance:
\[ \text{Required Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} \]
\[ \text{Required Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} \]
\[ \text{Required Speed} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

Step 1: Total servings consumed in 60 days
Cynthia eats 1 serving per day, so in 60 days, she will consume:
\[ 1 \text{ serving/day} \times 60 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ servings} \]

Step 2: Number of cartons needed
Each carton contains 15 servings. To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total servings by the number of servings per carton:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Step 3: Total cost
Each carton costs $4.00. Therefore, the total cost for 4 cartons is:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:

"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \). The two pairs of high heels together cost \( B - 5 \) dollars. One pair of heels costs $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \]

Since the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( B - 5 \), we can set up the equation:
\[ B - 5 = 99 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

The boots cost 104 dollars.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and their total age.

Let's denote Darrell's age by \( D \) and Allen's age by \( A \). According to the problem, the ratio of their ages is 7:11, which can be written as:
\[ \frac{D}{A} = \frac{7}{11} \]

This implies:
\[ D = \frac{7}{11}A \]

We also know that the sum of their ages is 162:
\[ D + A = 162 \]

Substituting \( D \) from the ratio equation into the sum equation:
\[ \frac{7}{11}A + A = 162 \]

To combine the terms, we need a common denominator:
\[ \frac{7A + 11A}{11} = 162 \]
\[ \frac{18A}{11} = 162 \]

Now, solve for \( A \):
\[ 18A = 162 \times 11 \]
\[ 18A = 1782 \]
\[ A = \frac{1782}{18} \]
\[ A = 99 \]

So, Allen's current age is 99. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[ 99 + 10 = 109 \]

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now is:

"To find the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to first determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average.

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and 80 plus 20 is 100.

Now, we add these guesses together and divide by the number of guesses to find the average:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{240}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average} = 80 \]

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:
\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To find the total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the second 20 minutes and then add them to the points he scored in the first 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% more points:
25% of 4 points = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point.

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored:
4 points + 1 point = 5 points.

Adding the points from both periods:
4 points + 5 points = 9 points.

Therefore, the total points Mike scored is:
9

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine the cost per yogurt.
3. Calculate the total cost for the number of yogurts he eats in 30 days.

Step 1: Total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats:
2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts

Step 2: Cost per yogurt
The yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00, so the cost per yogurt is:
$5.00 / 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt

Step 3: Total cost for 60 yogurts
The total cost for 60 yogurts is:
60 yogurts * $1.25/yogurt = $75.00

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to determine his average speed. Speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time.

First, let's calculate the total time John spends running each week:
- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs for half as much time as the first day, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.

So, the total time spent running each week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that John runs a total of 60 miles each week.

Now, we can calculate his average speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds and then calculate the distance she can travel in six hours given the time spent running and walking.

1. **Determine Dana's skipping speed and running speed:**
   - Dana's skipping speed is given as 3 miles per hour.
   - Since skipping is half as fast as running, her running speed is \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Dana can run at a rate four times faster than she can walk.
   - Let \( w \) be her walking speed. Then, \( 6 = 4w \).
   - Solving for \( w \), we get \( w = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance running = running speed \(\times\) time running = \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Distance walking = walking speed \(\times\) time walking = \( 1.5 \times 4 = 6 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = distance running + distance walking = \( 12 + 6 = 18 \) miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 18 miles.

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips.
2. Determine how many calories are left in your daily calorie target.
3. Calculate how many grams of chips correspond to the remaining calories.

First, calculate the total number of calories in the 300g bag:
- Each serving has 250 calories.
- There are 5 servings in the bag.
- Total calories in the bag = 250 calories/serving * 5 servings = 1250 calories.

Next, determine how many calories you have left in your daily target:
- Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
- You have already consumed 1800 calories.
- Remaining calories = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

Now, calculate how many grams of chips correspond to the remaining 200 calories:
- The bag has 1250 calories in 300 grams.
- Calories per gram = 1250 calories / 300 grams = 4.1667 calories/gram.
- Grams you can eat = 200 calories / 4.1667 calories/gram ≈ 48 grams.

Therefore, you can eat approximately 48 grams of chips.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice used.
2. Calculate the number of Post-it notes she had initially plus the number in the package.
3. Subtract the number of Post-it notes remaining from the total to find the number in the package.

First, we know Candice placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee. So, she used 220 Post-it notes.

Next, we know she had 23 Post-it notes remaining after using 220. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes she had before using them is:
\[ 220 + 23 = 243 \]

Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. Let \( x \) be the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased. The total number of Post-it notes she had before using them is:
\[ 80 + x \]

We already calculated that the total number of Post-it notes she had before using them is 243. So, we set up the equation:
\[ 80 + x = 243 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 243 - 80 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package that she purchased is:

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he buys is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Therefore, the cost of each red tie is:

Cost per red tie = Cost per blue tie + 50% of cost per blue tie
Cost per red tie = $40 + 0.5 * $40
Cost per red tie = $40 + $20
Cost per red tie = $60

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
Total spent on red ties = 10 * $60
Total spent on red ties = $600

Finally, the total amount spent on all ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

Total spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
Total spent on ties = $200 + $600
Total spent on ties = $800

"To find the total number of gems in the chest, we need to calculate the number of each type of gem and then sum them up.

1. **Diamonds**: There are 175 diamonds.
2. **Rubies**: There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So, the number of rubies is:
   \[
   175 - 35 = 140
   \]
3. **Emeralds**: There are twice the number of emeralds as rubies. So, the number of emeralds is:
   \[
   2 \times 140 = 280
   \]

Now, we sum up the number of each type of gem:
\[
175 + 140 + 280 = 595
\]

Thus, the total number of gems in the chest is 595.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of boys at the school.
2. Calculate the total number of students.
3. Use the ratio of students to teachers to find the number of teachers.

Step 1: Determine the number of boys.
Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Step 2: Calculate the total number of students.
\[ \text{Total number of students} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} = 120 + 60 = 180 \]

Step 3: Use the ratio of students to teachers to find the number of teachers.
The ratio is 5 students to every teacher, so:
\[ \text{Number of teachers} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{5} = \frac{180}{5} = 36 \]

Thus, the number of teachers is:

"To find out how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to calculate the total number of classes she teaches, the total number of students, and then multiply by the charge per student.

First, calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week:
- On weekdays (Monday to Friday), she teaches 5 classes each day, so for 5 days, that's \(5 \times 5 = 25\) classes.
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.

So, the total number of classes in a week is \(25 + 8 = 33\) classes.

Next, calculate the total number of students:
- Each class has 15 students, so for 33 classes, that's \(33 \times 15 = 495\) students.

Finally, calculate the total amount of money she makes:
- She charges $15.00 per student, so for 495 students, that's \(495 \times 15 = 7425\).

Therefore, Judy makes $7425 in one week.

"To find out how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to calculate the total cost of the cell phones including the interest, and then divide that total by the number of months.

1. First, calculate the total cost of the cell phones without interest:
   \[
   \text{Total cost without interest} = 5 \times 150 = 750
   \]

2. Next, calculate the total interest for all the cell phones:
   \[
   \text{Total interest} = 750 \times 0.02 = 15
   \]

3. Add the total interest to the total cost without interest to get the total cost with interest:
   \[
   \text{Total cost with interest} = 750 + 15 = 765
   \]

4. Finally, divide the total cost with interest by the number of months to find the monthly payment:

"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first 180 days and the remaining days of the year.

1. **First 180 days:**
   - The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food per day.
   - Total cups of food for 180 days: \( 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \).

2. **Remaining days of the year:**
   - A year has 365 days.
   - Remaining days after the first 180 days: \( 365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days} \).
   - The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food per day.
   - Total cups of food for 185 days: \( 185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups} \).

3. **Total cups of food for the first year:**
   - Total cups for the first 180 days: 180 cups.
   - Total cups for the remaining 185 days: 370 cups.
   - Total cups for the year: \( 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \).

4. **Number of bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 110 cups of dog food.
   - Number of bags required: \( \frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags} \).

Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year.

"First, let's determine how much laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Sarah's laundry} = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \]

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry:

\[ 400 = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \]

Solving for David's laundry:

\[ \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much laundry Raymond does. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah:

\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Sarah's laundry} \]

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry:

\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} \]

\[ \text{Difference} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

"To find the cost of the grooming after the discount, we first calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the original cost.

The original cost of grooming is $100. The discount is 30%, which means the discount amount is 30% of $100.

Discount amount = 30% of $100 = 0.30 * $100 = $30

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original cost to find the final cost:

Final cost = Original cost - Discount amount = $100 - $30 = $70

The grooming cost is $70.

"First, we calculate the amount of water each girl received. Since each girl got \( \frac{1}{6} \) of 24 liters, we have:

\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters per girl} \]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they received together is:

\[ 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

Next, the boy received 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water given to the girls and the boy is:

\[ 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

The total amount of water initially available was 24 liters. Therefore, the amount of water left is:

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \). According to the problem, the team played 22 games in total, so we have:

\[ W + L = 22 \]

It is also given that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which gives us:

\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( L \):

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now, substituting \( L = 7 \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):

\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of cars**: There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.
2. **Cars that took an exit**: 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.
3. **Remaining cars**: After 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars left in the line is \( 30 - 5 = 25 \) cars.
4. **Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes**: 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.
5. **Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes**: Let \( x \) be the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes.

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

"John drinks water with his meals and before bed every weekday, which amounts to 4 glasses of water per day. Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks \(4 \times 5 = 20\) glasses of water from Monday to Friday. On the weekends, he only drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed, which is 3 glasses of water per day. For the two days of the weekend, he drinks \(3 \times 2 = 6\) glasses of water. Adding the weekday and weekend totals together, John drinks \(20 + 6 = 26\) glasses of water in a week.

"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we need to calculate the total time based on the rate at which the fog bank moves.

The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. Therefore, the rate of the fog bank is:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

The city is 42 miles across. To find the total time it takes to cover 42 miles, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Rate}} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{\frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} \]

Simplifying the expression:
\[ \text{Time} = 42 \text{ miles} \times \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 42 \times 3.3333 \]
\[ \text{Time} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps of how many pieces Poppy and her mom place and then determine how many pieces are left.

1. Poppy places a quarter of the 1000 pieces:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, after Poppy places her pieces, there are:
   \[
   1000 - 250 = 750 \text{ pieces remaining}
   \]

2. Her mom then places a third of the remaining 750 pieces:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, after her mom places her pieces, there are:
   \[
   750 - 250 = 500 \text{ pieces remaining}
   \]

Therefore, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is:

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box and then find the volume of one box. Finally, we multiply that by 3 to get the total volume.

The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side) to get the inner dimensions.

Inner length = 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
Inner width = 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
Inner height = 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
Inner volume of one box = Inner length × Inner width × Inner height
Inner volume of one box = 3 inches × 4 inches × 2 inches = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
Total inner volume = Inner volume of one box × 3
Total inner volume = 24 cubic inches × 3 = 72 cubic inches

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the total TV watching time for each day and then solve for Wednesday.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: \( x \) (30-minute episodes)
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

The total time spent watching TV is 7 hours. We can set up the equation:

\[ 1 + 1 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7 \]

Combine the constants:

\[ 5.5 + 0.5x = 7 \]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

\[ 0.5x = 1.5 \]

Divide both sides by 0.5:

\[ x = 3 \]

"To determine how much water Julia's boat took on by the time she reached the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Julia rowed to reach the shore.
2. Determine the rate at which water entered the boat.
3. Calculate the total amount of water that entered the boat based on the distance rowed.

First, we know that it took Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet. The shore was 64 seconds away, so we can calculate the total distance she rowed:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \left(\frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}}\right) \times 20 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that the boat took on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. We can calculate the total amount of water that entered the boat:

\[ \text{Total water} = \left(\frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 2 \text{ liters} = 8 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the total amount of water that the boat took on by the time Julia reached the shore is:

"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue she will make from selling it at the new, increased prices.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:
- She has 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10, each costing $10.
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
  \]
- She has 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10, each costing $16.
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
  \]
- The total cost is:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Next, let's calculate the selling price of the lumber, which has increased by 50%:
- The new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15/\text{board}
  \]
- The new price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24/\text{board}
  \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:
- Revenue from the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150
  \]
- Revenue from the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120
  \]
- The total revenue is:
  \[
  \$150 + \$120 = \$270
  \]

Finally, let's calculate the profit:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many teaspoons of sugar Katy used, given the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13 and the total amount of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water used is 120.

First, let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as \(7x\) and the number of cups of water as \(13x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total amount of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water is given by:
\[7x + 13x = 120\]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:
\[20x = 120\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 20:
\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar by substituting \(x\) back into the expression for the teaspoons of sugar:
\[7x = 7 \times 6 = 42\]

Therefore, the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of vehicles that were already at the port on the first day. According to the information, there were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles on the first day is:

\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles:

\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can determine the number of containers imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles/container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

Thus, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4.

"First, let's determine Lylah's salary four years ago. If Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, and Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary} = \text{Lylah's salary} + 0.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]
\[ 40000 = 1.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = 30769.23 \]

Next, we calculate Adrien's salary four years later. Adrien's salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago:

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 56000 \]

Now, we calculate Lylah's salary four years later. Since their salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%:

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 12307.69 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 43076.92 \]

Finally, we add Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries to find the total salary they were receiving four years later:

\[ \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary} = 99076.92 \]

"To determine how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the number of questions he completed in the given time for each test and then subtract this from the total number of questions for each test.

For the first test:
- Mark completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour.
- He had 8 hours to complete the test.
- Therefore, the number of questions he completed is \( 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ questions} \).

The first test had 75 questions, so the number of questions he left incomplete is:
\[ 75 - 40 = 35 \text{ questions} \]

For the second test:
- Mark completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour.
- He had 6 hours to complete the test.
- Therefore, the number of questions he completed is \( 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ questions} \).

The second test had 100 questions, so the number of questions he left incomplete is:
\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \text{ questions} \]

Adding the incomplete questions from both tests:
\[ 35 + 70 = 105 \]

"To find the number of pink gumballs, we start by setting up the equation based on the information given. Let \( b \) represent the number of blue gumballs and \( p \) represent the number of pink gumballs. According to the problem, there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. This can be expressed as:

\[ p = 4b + 22 \]

We are given that there are 12 blue gumballs, so \( b = 12 \). Substituting this value into the equation:

\[ p = 4(12) + 22 \]
\[ p = 48 + 22 \]
\[ p = 70 \]

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. 

The number of semi-automatic cars is calculated as follows:
Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars) = Semi-automatic cars
20 - (12 + 4) = 20 - 16 = 4 semi-automatic cars

Next, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:
( Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars ) * 100
( 4 / 20 ) * 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20%

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables:
- Let \( Q \) be the number of queens.
- Let \( B \) be the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) be the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we know:
1. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \).
2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
3. The total number of bees is 700: \( Q + B + W = 700 \).

First, substitute \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 2(2Q) = 700 \]
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is:

"To determine how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Jordan spends playing video games in one week.
2. Determine how much he would earn if he worked those hours instead.

First, Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, Jordan earns $10 per hour at his part-time job. Therefore, if he worked the 14 hours he usually spends playing video games, he would earn:
\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 140 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, Jordan would earn $140 in one week if he spent his video game time working instead.

"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare per year.
2. Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare per year by the total number of hectares.

First, since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, he can harvest 4 times a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests per year).

Next, each hectare produces 100 pineapples per harvest. Therefore, each hectare produces 100 pineapples * 4 harvests = 400 pineapples per year.

John has 10 hectares, so the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year is 400 pineapples per hectare * 10 hectares = 4000 pineapples.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information step by step:

1. In the first 6 hours, Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, she sees 1/2 that many bees return. 
   - 1/2 of 30 bees is 15 bees.
3. In the following 6 hours, she sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave.
   - Two times 30 bees is 60 bees.
4. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive.
   - Bees that left initially: 30 bees.
   - Bees that returned: 15 bees.
   - Bees that left again: 60 bees.
   - Total bees that left and did not return: 30 (initial) + 60 (second time) - 15 (returned) = 75 bees.
   - Therefore, 75 bees return in the last 6 hours.

The number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is 75.

"To determine how much Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost for inflating the tires of the bicycles, tricycles, and the unicycle.

1. **Bicycles:**
   - Each bicycle has 2 tires.
   - 5 people came by, so the total number of bicycle tires is \(5 \times 2 = 10\).
   - Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total cost for the bicycle tires is \(10 \times 0.25 = 2.50\) dollars.

2. **Tricycles:**
   - Each tricycle has 3 tires.
   - 3 people came by, so the total number of tricycle tires is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).
   - Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total cost for the tricycle tires is \(9 \times 0.25 = 2.25\) dollars.

3. **Unicycle:**
   - A unicycle has 1 tire.
   - 1 person came by, so the total number of unicycle tires is \(1 \times 1 = 1\).
   - Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total cost for the unicycle tire is \(1 \times 0.25 = 0.25\) dollars.

Now, we add up the total earnings from all the tires:
\[2.50 + 2.25 + 0.25 = 5.00\]

Therefore, Shawnda made 5.00 dollars that day.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it.
2. Dave ate 14 fries, so the remaining fries are \( x - 14 \).
3. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries. So, the remaining fries are \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \).
4. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries. The remaining fries are \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).
5. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, so the raccoon ate \( \frac{2}{3} \times (x - 30) \). The remaining fries are \( \frac{1}{3} \times (x - 30) \).
6. Ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 fries behind. So, the remaining fries are \( \frac{1}{3} \times (x - 30) - 1 = 5 \).

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times (x - 30) - 1 = 5
\]

Add 1 to both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times (x - 30) = 6
\]

Multiply both sides by 3:

\[
x - 30 = 18
\]

Add 30 to both sides:

\[
x = 48
\]

So, the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it is:

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the weekly class hours and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class each day:
- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes, each 1 hour long. Therefore, he spends:
  \[
  3 \text{ classes} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours/day}
  \]
- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes, each 2 hours long. Therefore, he spends:
  \[
  2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours/day}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends in class each week:
- He has 3 days with 3 hours each and 2 days with 4 hours each. Therefore, the total weekly class hours are:
  \[
  (3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ hours/day}) + (2 \text{ days} \times 4 \text{ hours/day}) = 9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

Finally, to find the total number of hours Kimo spends in class over the 16-week semester, we multiply the weekly class hours by the number of weeks:
\[
17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:

- The football field is 100 yards long.
- Running back and forth once covers a distance of \(100 \times 2 = 200\) yards.
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so the total distance he runs is \(200 \times 15 = 3000\) yards.

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs back and forth from the 40-yard line, which means she runs 40 yards to the end of the field and 40 yards back, covering a distance of \(40 \times 2 = 80\) yards.
- She does this 34 times, so the total distance she runs is \(80 \times 34 = 2720\) yards.

Now, we find the difference between the distances run by Blake and Kelly:
- The difference is \(3000 - 2720 = 280\) yards.

"Let's denote Seth's current age as \( S \) and Brooke's current age as \( B \). According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the equation:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \) and Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \). The problem states that the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the equation:
\[ (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( S = 2B \)
2. \( S + B = 24 \)

We can substitute \( S = 2B \) into the second equation:

"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs for each type of creature and then sum them up.

1. For the spiders: 
   - Each spider has 8 legs.
   - There are 80 spiders.
   - Total legs from spiders = \(80 \times 8 = 640\).

2. For the insects:
   - Each insect has 6 legs.
   - There are 90 insects.
   - Total legs from insects = \(90 \times 6 = 540\).

3. For the rare mutant invertebrates:
   - Each invertebrate has 10 legs.
   - There are 3 invertebrates.
   - Total legs from invertebrates = \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Now, we add up all the legs:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we add up the ages of all four birds:
- Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- Sally Two: 19 years

Total age = \(8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 51\)

"To determine how much Jessica will pay in a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum on all her debts, we first need to calculate the total minimum monthly payment and then find 50% more than this amount.

1. Calculate the total minimum monthly payment:
   - Student loans: $300
   - Credit card: $200
   - Mortgage: $500

   Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

2. Calculate 50% more than the total minimum monthly payment:
   - 50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

   Total monthly payment with 50% more = $1000 + $500 = $1500

3. Calculate the total annual payment:
   - Total monthly payment * 12 months = $1500 * 12 = $18,000

Therefore, Jessica will pay $18,000 in a year.

"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade.
2. Determine the total cost of making the lemonade.
3. Use the profit to find the total cost.
4. Calculate the cost of lemons based on the total cost.

First, let's find the total revenue. They made a profit of $25. Let's denote the total cost as \( C \). The profit is calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ 25 = \text{Total Revenue} - C \]
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = C + 25 \]

Next, we need to find the total cost. The cost to make one gallon of lemonade is:
\[ \text{Cost per gallon} = 3 \text{ (lemons)} + 2 \text{ (sugar)} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Let \( G \) be the number of gallons they made. The total cost is:
\[ C = 5G \]

The total revenue is the number of glasses sold times the price per glass. They get 20 glasses per gallon, so the total number of glasses is:
\[ \text{Total glasses} = 20G \]
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 0.50 \times 20G = 10G \]

Now we can set up the equation for profit:
\[ 25 = 10G - 5G \]
\[ 25 = 5G \]
\[ G = 5 \]

So, they made 5 gallons of lemonade. The cost of lemons for 5 gallons is:
\[ \text{Cost of lemons} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Therefore, the amount spent on lemons is:

"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to determine the total number of Chinese participants in the race. Given that there are 240 Asians in total and 80 of them are Japanese, the number of Chinese participants is:

240 (total Asians) - 80 (Japanese) = 160 (Chinese)

Next, we know that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

160 (Chinese) - 60 (boys) = 100 (girls)

Thus, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100.

2. Calculate the amount spent on car fuel.
3. Determine the remaining amount after rent and car fuel expenses.
4. Calculate the amount donated to charity.
5. Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount after the donation.
6. Find the final amount left.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. **Rent:**
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car Fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Car Fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Remaining Amount after Rent and Car Fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining Amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Donation to Charity:**
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Remaining Amount after Donation:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining Amount after Donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Subtract Amounts Given to Daughter and Wife:**
   \[
   \text{Final Amount} = 1250 - 200 - 700 = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations is:

- Therefore, his earnings for the first week are \(10 \times 5 = 50\) dollars.

For the second week:
- Lloyd earns $10 per hour.
- He tutored for 8 hours.
- Therefore, his earnings for the second week are \(10 \times 8 = 80\) dollars.

Adding the earnings from both weeks:
- Total earnings = \(50 + 80 = 130\) dollars.

Thus, Lloyd earned a total of 130 dollars for the first two weeks.

"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we first need to find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, and Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies.

Let \( C \) represent the number of white carnations. According to the problem:
\[ 5C = 200 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Next, we need to find out how many red roses she ordered. The problem states that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations.

Let \( R \) represent the number of red roses. Then:
\[ R = 4C \]

Substituting the value of \( C \):
\[ R = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Sandra ordered 160 red roses. Since Fred has not delivered all the red roses, he must deliver the remaining 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.
3. Jan is currently 30 years old.

First, let's determine Jan's age two years ago:
- Jan's current age = 30
- Jan's age two years ago = 30 - 2 = 28

Next, we use the information about Mark's age two years ago:
- Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.
- Half of Jan's age two years ago = 28 / 2 = 14
- Mark's age two years ago = 14 + 5 = 19

Now, let's find Mark's current age:
- Mark's current age = 19 + 2 = 21

Finally, we use the information that Jean is two years older than Mark:
- Jean's current age = Mark's current age + 2 = 21 + 2 = 23

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old.

"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time each team takes to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay.

**Well-Rounded Team:**
Each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are 4 members, the total time for the well-rounded team is:
\[ 4 \times 55 = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

**Less Well-Rounded Team:**
The first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. Therefore, the times for each runner are:
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

The total time for the less well-rounded team is:
\[ 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

**Difference in Time:**
The well-rounded team completes the race in 220 seconds, while the less well-rounded team completes it in 222 seconds. The difference in time is:
\[ 222 - 220 = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

The faster team will win by 2 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then determine how much more likely one event is compared to the other, expressed as a percentage.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   - The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - The probability is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).
   - Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is \( 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \).

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5.
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25.
   - To find how much more likely the first event is compared to the second, we calculate the ratio of the probabilities and then convert it to a percentage:
     \[
     \text{Ratio} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
     \]
   - This means the first event is 2 times more likely than the second event.
   - To express this as a percentage, we calculate:
     \[
     (2 - 1) \times 100\% = 1 \times 100\% = 100\%
     \]

Thus, it is 100% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = 10 cages * 5 pieces/cage = 50 pieces of straw.

2. **Determine the total straw used for the rabbits:**
   - There is a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed.
   - Total straw for rabbits = 20 pieces of straw.

3. **Calculate the total straw used for the rats:**
   - Total straw distributed = 160 pieces.
   - Straw used for hamsters = 50 pieces.
   - Straw used for rabbits = 20 pieces.
   - Straw used for rats = 160 pieces - 50 pieces - 20 pieces = 90 pieces.

4. **Determine the number of rats:**
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for rats = 90 pieces.
   - Number of rats = 90 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 15 rats.

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can use the formula for compound interest, since the interest is applied monthly:

\[ A = P (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of months the interest is applied.

Given:
- \( P = 100 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.02 \) (2% monthly interest)
- \( n = 3 \) months

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ A = 100 (1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 (1.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 \]
\[ A = 106.1208 \]

"To determine the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the lowest score among the first five tests.
2. Calculate the sum of the remaining four scores.
3. Determine the total sum required for the five highest scores to average 93.
4. Calculate the score needed on the sixth test to reach this total sum.

First, let's identify the lowest score among the first five tests:
- Scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86
- The lowest score is 71.

Next, calculate the sum of the remaining four scores:
- Sum of 89, 92, 100, and 86:
  \[
  89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367
  \]

Now, determine the total sum required for the five highest scores to average 93:
- The average of the five highest scores should be 93:
  \[
  \text{Total sum required} = 93 \times 5 = 465
  \]

Finally, calculate the score needed on the sixth test to reach this total sum:
- Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test.
- The sum of the five highest scores including the sixth test should be 465:
  \[
  367 + x = 465
  \]
- Solving for \( x \):
  \[
  x = 465 - 367 = 98
  \]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 98 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score.

"To find the total kilometers Michael rode, we can break the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

For the first four weeks:
- He rides 5 times a week.
- Each ride is 25 kilometers.
- Total kilometers per week = 5 rides/week * 25 kilometers/ride = 125 kilometers/week.
- Total kilometers for four weeks = 125 kilometers/week * 4 weeks = 500 kilometers.

For the next three weeks:
- He rides 2 times a week.
- Each ride is 60 kilometers.
- Total kilometers per week = 2 rides/week * 60 kilometers/ride = 120 kilometers/week.
- Total kilometers for three weeks = 120 kilometers/week * 3 weeks = 360 kilometers.

Adding the kilometers from both periods:
- Total kilometers = 500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40g. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we know that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. Therefore, each candied apple weighs:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

Since there are 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:
\[ 80 \times 20 = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Adding the total weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples gives us the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:
\[ 1000 + 1600 = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

"To find out how many cakes Rose bought in total over the three days, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
2. On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. This means:
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ cakes}
   \]
3. On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. This means:
   \[
   5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ cakes}
   \]

Now, we add up the number of cakes bought each day:
\[
4 + 12 + 60 = 76

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates is 6 plates.
   - Total cost of half a dozen plates = 6 * $6000 = $36000.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Cost of twenty dozen cups = $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

3. **Determine the cost per cup:**
   - Twenty dozen cups is equivalent to 20 * 12 = 240 cups.
   - Cost per cup = Total cost of twenty dozen cups / Number of cups = $34800 / 240 = $145.

The total cost of buying each cup is $145.

"To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the jacket:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the additional amount she needs is:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so her total earnings from babysitting are:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Adding her babysitting earnings to her initial savings:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Sara still needs:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we divide the remaining amount by her earnings per lawn:
\[ 40 \div 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day and the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, and he has two more white chickens than red chickens. We can set up the following equations based on this information:

1. The total number of eggs collected each day:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

2. The relationship between the number of white and red chickens:
\[ w = r + 2 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( r \):

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, which is the total distance Gary walks. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \(t\) it takes to walk a certain distance \(d\) at a constant speed \(v\) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substitute the known values:

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking.

"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the first day, which is given as 100.
2. Calculate the number of customers on the second day, which is 50 more than the first day:
   \[
   100 + 50 = 150
   \]
3. Let \( x \) be the number of customers on the third day. The total number of customers over the three days is given as 500. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   100 + 150 + x = 500
   \]
4. Simplify the equation to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   250 + x = 500
   \]
   \[
   x = 500 - 250
   \]
   \[
   x = 250

"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. 

From the problem, we know:
1. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
2. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.
3. Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

First, let's express the amounts of water in the pools 4 minutes ago:
- 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.
- 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons.

According to the first condition:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify this equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ B = 2S + 16 \]

According to the second condition:
\[ B = 4S \]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( B = 2S + 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

Set the two expressions for \( B \) equal to each other:
\[ 2S + 16 = 4S \]

Solve for \( S \):
\[ 16 = 2S \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth needs to pay back. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount.

The additional 10% of $2000 is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she needs to pay back is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount she will pay over 12 months if she pays $165 each month:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she needs to pay back to find the remaining balance:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be:

Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, to find the total number of flowers in the vase, we add the number of roses and the number of dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

   \]
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
   \]

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
1. Harriet's age in three years:
   \[
   21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years}
   \]
2. Adrian's age in three years:
   \[

"First, let's determine how many candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} = 54 \]

Solving for Robert's candies:

\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Next, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, we can calculate the number of candies James has:

\[ \text{James's candies} = \text{Robert's candies} + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James:

\[ \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Thus, John has 21 more candies than James.

"To determine how many hours Mike spends writing letters each week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pen pals Mike still has.
2. Determine the total number of letters he receives each week.
3. Calculate the total number of pages he needs to write in response.
4. Determine the total time he spends writing these pages.
5. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pen pals Mike still has.
- Mike originally had 5 pen pals.
- He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them.
- Therefore, he still has \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) pen pals.

Step 2: Determine the total number of letters he receives each week.
- Each of his 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week.
- Therefore, he receives \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) letters a week.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of pages he needs to write in response.
- Each letter is 5 pages long.
- Therefore, he needs to write \( 6 \times 5 = 30 \) pages a week.

Step 4: Determine the total time he spends writing these pages.
- Mike can write a page every 6 minutes.
- Therefore, he spends \( 30 \times 6 = 180 \) minutes writing each week.

Step 5: Convert the total time from minutes to hours.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, he spends \( \frac{180}{60} = 3 \) hours writing each week.

"To determine how many minutes Jason has left in his phone plan, we need to calculate the total minutes he has used and subtract that from his monthly allowance.

1. **Daily calls with the boss:**
   - Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day.
   - There are 30 days in the month.
   - Total minutes for boss calls: \( 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Extra calls:**
   - Jason has used an additional 300 minutes for calls to other people.

3. **Total minutes used:**
   - Total minutes used = Minutes for boss calls + Extra minutes
   - Total minutes used = \( 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \).

4. **Minutes remaining:**
   - Jason's monthly allowance is 1000 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin.
   - Griffin now has \( 24 - 5 = 19 \) fries.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle.
   - Billy took \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) fries.
   - Griffin now has \( 19 - 10 = 9 \) fries.
4. Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries.
5. Colby took from Griffin 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken.
   - Colby took \( 5 - 3 = 2 \) fries.
   - Griffin now has \( 9 - 2 = 7 \) fries before Ginger gave him any fries.
6. In the end, Griffin had 27 fries.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin.
   - Therefore, \( 7 + x = 27 \).

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 27 - 7 \]
\[ x = 20 \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's start by identifying the key information and setting up the equations.

1. There are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium.
2. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.
3. This difference (28 snails) is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.
4. Let \( f \) be the number of fish in each aquarium. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2f \).

According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the total number of fish:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2f \]
\[ 28 = 4f \]
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ f = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To find the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
3. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree to find the remaining weight.

First, calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it:
- The tree is 200 feet tall.
- Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.
- The number of 10-foot sections in a 200-foot tree is \( \frac{200}{10} = 20 \) sections.
- Therefore, the total weight of the tree is \( 20 \times 400 = 8000 \) pounds.

Next, determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate:
- The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood.
- 30% of 8000 pounds is \( 0.30 \times 8000 = 2400 \) pounds.

Finally, subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree:
- The remaining weight of the tree is \( 8000 - 2400 = 5600 \) pounds.

\[ 4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35 = 15.00 \]

The total cost of the items is $15.00. She pays with a $20 bill. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:

\[ 20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00 \]

Therefore, the cashier gives back $5.00 in change.

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, let's break down the information given:

- The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
- The collar takes a tenth of the body, so it takes \(900 / 10 = 90\) stitches.
- The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes \(90 \times 2 = 180\) stitches.
- The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[ 900 \text{ (body)} + 90 \text{ (collar)} + 180 \text{ (rosette)} = 1170 \text{ stitches} \]

The remaining stitches are for the two sleeves:
\[ 1800 \text{ (total)} - 1170 \text{ (body, collar, rosette)} = 630 \text{ stitches} \]

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes:
\[ 630 \text{ stitches} / 2 = 315 \text{ stitches} \]

Each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to break down the information given and calculate the lines for each part of his role.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The song has 54 lines in the lyrics.
   - All 54 lines are his to memorize.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song.
   - Therefore, the first scene has \( 2 \times 54 = 108 \) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, Sean's lines in the first scene are \( \frac{108}{3} = 36 \) lines.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the song.
   - Therefore, the second scene has \( 54 + 6 = 60 \) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, Sean's lines in the second scene are \( \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \) lines.

Now, we sum up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
- Lines from the song: 54
- Lines from the first scene: 36
- Lines from the second scene: 48

Total lines Sean has to memorize:
\[ 54 + 36 + 48 = 138 \]

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
   \[
   R = 6S
   \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:

\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:

\[
3S + 9 = 27
\]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[
3S = 18
\]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[
S = 6
\]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of spots on a mamba. Since a cobra has 70 spots and this is twice as many as a mamba, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 70 = 2 \times \text{(number of spots on a mamba)} \]

Solving for the number of spots on a mamba:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, and 60 mambas, each with 35 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots on cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]
\[ \text{Total spots on mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of spots:

\[ \text{Total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots:

\[ \text{Half the total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

"To find the number of 5-star rows, we first calculate the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows. There are three rows of 8 stars and two rows of 6 stars.

The total number of stars in the 8-star rows is:
3 rows * 8 stars/row = 24 stars

The total number of stars in the 6-star rows is:
2 rows * 6 stars/row = 12 stars

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows:
24 stars + 12 stars = 36 stars

The flag has 76 stars in total. Subtracting the number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars gives the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
76 stars - 36 stars = 40 stars

Since each 5-star row contains 5 stars, the number of 5-star rows is:
40 stars / 5 stars/row = 8 rows

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much weight Joey loses in one week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the weight loss per week for Joey is:

\[ \text{Weight loss per week for Joey} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Therefore, Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we can set up the following proportion:

\[ \text{Weight loss per week for Sandy} = \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds:

\[ \text{Weeks for Sandy to lose 8 pounds} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 16 \text{ weeks} \]

"To determine the total number of new limbs a person will grow after drinking Helena's Lots-of-Limbs Serum over 15 days, we need to calculate the number of new arms and new legs separately and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the number of new arms:**
   - The serum causes a person to grow an extra arm every 3 days.
   - Over 15 days, the number of new arms is calculated by dividing 15 by 3.
   - \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \) new arms.

2. **Calculate the number of new legs:**
   - The serum causes a person to grow an extra leg every 5 days.
   - Over 15 days, the number of new legs is calculated by dividing 15 by 5.
   - \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \) new legs.

3. **Calculate the total number of new limbs:**
   - Total new limbs = number of new arms + number of new legs
   - Total new limbs = 5 + 3 = 8

Thus, after 15 days, the person will have grown 8 new limbs.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 suits * $100/suit = $600

Next, the cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150

Now, the cost of the flight ticket:
$700 + (5 * $100) = $700 + $500 = $1200

Adding up all the expenses so far:
$600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight) = $1950

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the total amount he plans to spend and save is:
$6000 (total money) - $2000 (savings) = $4000

Subtracting the expenses from the amount he plans to spend:
$4000 - $1950 = $2050

Therefore, Theo has $2050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Currently, Cera is 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, Noah is now \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age.
   - Noah was 20 years old six years ago, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60,000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half what it is now.
   - Therefore, the current population of Chile is \(60,000 \times 2 = 120,000\).

The population of Chile now is 120,000."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \). According to the problem:

- The number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[ 6D + D = 210 \]

\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, solve for \( D \):

\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]

\[ D = 30 \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many pencils are in each of Jam's boxes. We know that Jam has three boxes and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. We can set up the equation:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} + 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ \text{number of pencils per box} = 8 \]

So, each of Jam's boxes contains 8 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many boxes are required to store all the pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils. The total number of pencils is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon’s iced coffee is, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the additional liquid from the cream.

1. **Cooling by Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we calculate the number of ice cubes needed:
     \[
     \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Weakening by Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Weakening by Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of junior and senior programmers and their respective salaries, then calculate the total monthly payroll for all programmers.

1. **Determine the number of junior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees.
   - Number of junior programmers = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \).

2. **Determine the number of senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of senior programmers = Total employees - Number of junior programmers.
   - Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60.

3. **Determine the salary of senior programmers:**
   - Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month.
   - Each senior programmer is paid $400 more than each junior programmer.
   - Salary of each senior programmer = $2000 + $400 = $2400.

4. **Calculate the total monthly payroll for junior programmers:**
   - Total payroll for junior programmers = Number of junior programmers \(\times\) Salary of each junior programmer.
   - Total payroll for junior programmers = 40 \(\times\) $2000 = $80,000.

5. **Calculate the total monthly payroll for senior programmers:**

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( c \) represent the number of cows and \( h \) represent the number of chickens. According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The total number of animals is 60.
2. The number of chickens is twice the number of cows.

We can express these as:
\[ c + h = 60 \]
\[ h = 2c \]

Next, we substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( c \):
\[ c + 2c = 60 \]
\[ 3c = 60 \]
\[ c = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ h = 2c = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times c) + (2 \times h) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times 20) + (2 \times 40) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

Thus, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is:

"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can determine the weights of the other animals based on the information provided:

- The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
- The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
- The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
- The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, to find the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself:

- Weight of the pink frog: 50 pounds
- Weight of the blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Weight of the green toad: 50 pounds
- Weight of the yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Weight of the red bird: 30 pounds

"To determine how many socks Lindsay has missed, we first need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed. 

1. Lindsay washes 10 pairs of socks. Since each pair consists of 2 socks, the total number of socks in pairs is:
   \[
   10 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ socks per pair} = 20 \text{ socks}
   \]

2. Lindsay also washes 15 loose socks. 

3. Adding the socks from pairs and the loose socks gives us the total number of socks she has washed:
   \[
   20 \text{ socks} + 15 \text{ socks} = 35 \text{ socks}
   \]

4. There are 50 socks that need washing in total. To find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks:
   \[
   50 \text{ socks} - 35 \text{ socks} = 15 \text{ socks}
   \]

Thus, Lindsay has missed 15 socks.

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the total amount she will owe after the interest is applied. The interest is calculated as follows:

Interest = Principal × Rate × Time

Here, the principal (P) is $3,650, the rate (R) is 10% or 0.10, and the time (T) is 5 months, which is 5/12 of a year.

Interest = $3,650 × 0.10 × (5/12)

Let's calculate the interest:

Interest = $3,650 × 0.10 × 0.4167
Interest = $3,650 × 0.04167
Interest = $152.50

Now, we add the interest to the principal to find the total amount to be repaid:

Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Total Amount = $3,650 + $152.50
Total Amount = $3,802.50

Since Karan has to pay this amount in equal monthly installments over 5 months, we divide the total amount by 5:

Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of Months
Monthly Payment = $3,802.50 / 5
Monthly Payment = $760.50

Therefore, Karan has to pay $760.50 per month.

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up an equation based on the information given. If he sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, then he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. Let \( x \) represent the total amount of land he had initially. The equation to represent the situation is:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Calculating the right side:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many popsicles each person has based on the given ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. Together, they have 5 + 6 = 11 parts of the total number of popsicles.

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find the value of one part by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \text{Value of one part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"To determine how much money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to streaming services, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services and then compare it to the cost of the cable package.

1. **Cost of Netflix:**
   - Netflix costs $10 per month.

2. **Cost of Hulu and Disney Plus with the bundle discount:**
   - Normally, each service costs $10 per month.
   - The total cost for both services without the discount is \( 10 + 10 = 20 \) dollars per month.
   - With a 20% discount, the savings on the bundle is \( 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \) dollars per month.
   - Therefore, the cost of the bundle is \( 20 - 4 = 16 \) dollars per month.

3. **Total cost of all streaming services:**
   - Netflix: $10 per month
   - Hulu and Disney Plus bundle: $16 per month
   - Total cost: \( 10 + 16 = 26 \) dollars per month.

4. **Savings by cancelling the cable package:**
   - Cost of the cable package: $60 per month
   - Total cost of streaming services: $26 per month
   - Savings: \( 60 - 26 = 34 \) dollars per month.

Thus, Tim saves $34 per month by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to the streaming services.

"To find the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing, we first need to calculate the total time she spent on all activities and then determine what portion of that time was spent editing.

1. Time spent writing the song: 4 hours
2. Time spent recording the song: 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
3. Time spent editing the song: 90 minutes = 1.5 hours (since 90 minutes is 1.5 hours)

Next, we calculate the total time spent on all activities:
Total time = Time writing + Time recording + Time editing
Total time = 4 hours + 2 hours + 1.5 hours
Total time = 7.5 hours

Now, we calculate the percentage of the total time spent editing:
Percentage spent editing = (Time editing / Total time) * 100
Percentage spent editing = (1.5 hours / 7.5 hours) * 100
Percentage spent editing = 0.2 * 100
Percentage spent editing = 20%

Thus, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is 20%.

"To determine how many kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days by reducing the time he uses the air conditioner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner:
   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour.
   - Mel uses it for 8 hours a day.
   - Daily energy consumption = 900 watts/hour * 8 hours = 7200 watts/day.

2. Convert the daily energy consumption to kilowatts:
   - 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts.
   - Daily energy consumption in kilowatts = 7200 watts/day / 1000 = 7.2 kilowatts/day.

3. Calculate the energy consumption if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours:
   - New usage time = 8 hours/day - 5 hours/day = 3 hours/day.
   - New daily energy consumption = 900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watts/day.
   - New daily energy consumption in kilowatts = 2700 watts/day / 1000 = 2.7 kilowatts/day.

4. Calculate the daily energy savings:
   - Daily energy savings = 7.2 kilowatts/day - 2.7 kilowatts/day = 4.5 kilowatts/day.

"To determine how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of her purchases and subtract that from the $10 her parents gave her.

1. **Cost of taffy:**
   - The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off.""
   - The first pound costs $3.
   - The second pound is half off, so it costs \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.50 \) dollars.
   - Total cost for 2 pounds of taffy: \( 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of the mixed bag of seashells:**
   - The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

3. **Cost of the magnets:**
   - Each magnet costs $0.25.
   - Sally bought 4 magnets, so the total cost for the magnets is \( 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \) dollar.

4. **Total cost of all purchases:**
   - Total cost = Cost of taffy + Cost of seashells + Cost of magnets
   - Total cost = \( 4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00 \) dollars.

5. **Money left:**
   - Sally started with $10.
   - She spent $7.00.
   - Money left = \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars.

"To find out how much Tim spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks after the discount and add the cost of the finale firework.

First, calculate the total cost of the two packages of fireworks before the discount:
- The first package costs $400.
- The second package costs twice as much as the first, so it costs $400 * 2 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages is:
\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the two packages:
- A 20% discount means he pays 80% of the total cost.
- 80% of $1200 is calculated as \( 1200 \times 0.80 = 960 \).

Now, add the cost of the finale firework:
- The finale firework costs $150.

The total amount Tim spent is:
\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

"To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we first calculate the total number of cookies she will consume over 30 days. Since she eats 2 cookies a night, we multiply 2 by 30:

\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we need to convert the total number of cookies into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by 12:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozen cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog.

1. First, we calculate the number of candles that are expected to explode. Since Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, 1% of them are expected to explode.
   \[
   \text{Number of exploding candles} = 0.01 \times 50000 = 500
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many of these exploding candles also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. We know that 5% of the more dangerous (exploding) candles have this defect.
   \[
   \text{Number of exploding and smelling candles} = 0.05 \times 500 = 25
   \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog is 25.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \( x \).

For her sister:
1. She gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. She gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. She gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Subtract 150 from both sides:

\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 180.
2. The total number of humps is 304.

We can write these as:
\[ C + D = 180 \]
\[ 2C + D = 304 \]

We can solve this system of equations step by step. First, we can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( D \):
\[ (2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2C + D - C - D = 124 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we know \( C = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( D \):
\[ 124 + D = 180 \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is 56.

"To find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the trip into segments and sum the distances.

1. **First 4 days**: Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   \[
   200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km}
   \]

2. **Next 2 days**: He traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days.
   \[
   30\% \times 800 \text{ km} = 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km}
   \]

3. **Next 1 day**: He wasn't traveling at all.
   \[
   0 \text{ km}
   \]

4. **Second week (7 days)**: He traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   \[
   300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km}

"To find out how big Timothy's locker is, we can start by determining the size of Zack's locker based on the information given about Peter's locker. 

We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and that it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. Therefore, to find the size of Zack's locker, we can multiply the size of Peter's locker by 4:

\[ \text{Zack's locker} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we know that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Therefore, to find the size of Timothy's locker, we can multiply the size of Zack's locker by 2:

\[ \text{Timothy's locker} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Thus, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the elevation where the comb landed.
2. Calculate the difference between Oliver's current elevation and the comb's elevation.

First, we know that Stanley was at an elevation of 10,000 feet and the comb fell 4,000 feet. Therefore, the comb landed at:
\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we calculate the difference between the comb's elevation and Oliver's current elevation:
\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the comb.

"First, we start with the initial number of cats on the rock, which is 50. Four boats came and each carried away 5 cats. So, the total number of cats carried away by the boats is:

\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Subtracting these 20 cats from the initial 50 cats, we get the number of cats remaining on the rock:

\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Next, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. To find out how many cats that is, we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \]

Subtracting these 18 cats from the 30 remaining cats, we get the final number of cats left on the rock:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars, came from the tattered jeans.

4. **Determine the original prices of the jeans:**
   - Let \( T \) be the original price of the tattered jeans.
   - Let \( J \) be the original price of the jogger jeans.
   - The tattered jeans were bought for $28, so the savings from the tattered jeans is \( T - 28 = 4 \).
   - Solving for \( T \), we get \( T = 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The jogger jeans were bought for $22, so the savings from the jogger jeans is \( J - 22 = 2 \).
   - Solving for \( J \), we get \( J = 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:**
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 more than the tattered jeans.

"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles rented for the trip. 

First, we calculate the capacity of the buses:
- Each bus can hold 60 employees.
- There are 4 buses.
- So, the total capacity of the buses is \(4 \times 60 = 240\) employees.

Next, we calculate the capacity of the minibusses:
- Each minibus can hold 30 employees.
- There are 6 minibusses.
- So, the total capacity of the minibusses is \(6 \times 30 = 180\) employees.

Then, we calculate the capacity of the minivans:
- Each minivan can hold 15 employees.
- There are 10 minivans.
- So, the total capacity of the minivans is \(10 \times 15 = 150\) employees.

Finally, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles to get the total number of employees that can join the day trip:
- Total capacity = \(240 + 180 + 150 = 570\) employees.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is 18 guests.
   - Therefore, he prepared 18 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 36 hotdogs for the second hotdogs.
   - Additionally, he prepared 36 - 18 = 18 hotdogs for the remaining guests who would only have one hotdog.
   - Total hotdogs prepared = 36 (for second hotdogs) + 18 (for first hotdogs) = 54 hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Total hotdogs needed = 40 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 80 hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only had 54 hotdogs.
   - The number of hotdogs short = 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26 / 2 = 13 guests.

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{width} \]

\[ \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the room. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \]

\[ P = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} \]

\[ P = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet.

"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

**Elizabeth's Beads:**
- 1 pack of red beads: 1 * 20 = 20 beads
- 2 packs of clear beads: 2 * 20 = 40 beads
- Total beads Elizabeth bought: 20 + 40 = 60 beads

**Margareth's Beads:**
- 3 packs of blue beads: 3 * 20 = 60 beads
- 4 packs of red beads: 4 * 20 = 80 beads
- Total beads Margareth bought: 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Next, we find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters:
- Difference: 140 - 60 = 80 beads

Thus, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

"First, let's calculate the temperature increase due to Marcus baking. He bakes for 3 hours, and each hour the temperature increases by 5 degrees. So, the total temperature increase from baking is:

3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees, so after baking, the temperature is:

40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

Next, Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. So, the total temperature decrease is:

30 minutes / 10 minutes * 2 degrees = 3 * 2 degrees = 6 degrees

Subtracting this from the temperature after baking gives us the final temperature:

55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon and then use the information about James's performance to find out how long it took him to complete the run.

First, let's calculate Jon's total time:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate James's time for each segment:
- Swim: James finishes 10% faster than Jon. 
  \[ \text{James's swim time} = 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]
- Bike: James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon.
  \[ \text{James's bike time} = 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( x \) be the time it took James to complete the run. According to the problem, Jon won by 10 minutes, so James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

Therefore, it took James 59 minutes to complete the run.

"To find the length of Movie A, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since Movie C is 1.25 hours long:
   \[
   1.25 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 75 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. Determine the length of Movie B. Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C:
   \[
   75 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. Calculate the length of Movie A. Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B:
   \[
   \frac{80 \text{ minutes}}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, Movie A is 20 minutes long.

"First, let's determine how far the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 30 \text{ minutes} = \frac{30}{60} \text{ hours} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of hay the horse will eat for running 16 miles. The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile.

\[ \text{Hay needed} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of 8 bails of hay. Each bail costs $3.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, so he has:

\[ \text{Total money} = 6 \times 5 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we calculate the change Michael will have after buying the hay.

\[ \text{Change} = 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

"Let's break down the costs and savings to find the regular price of the popcorn.

If you buy the super ticket, the total cost is $20 for the movie and $1 extra for the popcorn and soda, making it $21 in total.

If you buy the regular movie ticket, it costs $12. The soda costs $3, and let's denote the regular price of the popcorn as \( P \).

The total cost for the regular ticket, popcorn, and soda is:
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 15 + P \]

You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, so the cost of the regular ticket, popcorn, and soda should be $2 less than the super ticket cost:
\[ 15 + P = 21 - 2 \]
\[ 15 + P = 19 \]
\[ P = 19 - 15 \]
\[ P = 4 \]

The regular price of the popcorn is $4.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the original cost per balloon before the price increase. We know that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Original cost per balloon} = \frac{\text{Total cost for 20 balloons}}{\text{Number of balloons}} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \]

Next, we need to find the new cost per balloon after the price increase. The problem states that the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = \text{Original cost per balloon} + 20 = 45 + 20 = 65 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for filling 170 balloons at the new price. This can be done by multiplying the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons:

\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = \text{New cost per balloon} \times \text{Number of balloons} = 65 \times 170 = 11050 \]

Therefore, the amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase is:

"To determine the total cost of the potting soil, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of one raised bed.
2. Multiply the volume of one raised bed by the number of beds to get the total volume of soil needed.
3. Determine how many bags of potting soil are required.
4. Calculate the total cost based on the number of bags needed.

Step 1: Calculate the volume of one raised bed.
The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (raised bed) is given by the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]
For one raised bed:
\[ V = 8 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total volume of soil needed for 10 raised beds.
\[ \text{Total volume} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Step 3: Determine how many bags of potting soil are required.
Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil.
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of green cards:**
   - There are 15 red cards.
   - Green cards are 60% more than the red cards.
   - 60% of 15 is calculated as \( 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \).
   - Therefore, the number of green cards is \( 15 + 9 = 24 \).

2. **Determine the number of yellow cards:**
   - Yellow cards are as many as the sum of red and green cards.
   - The sum of red and green cards is \( 15 + 24 = 39 \).
   - Therefore, the number of yellow cards is 39.

3. **Calculate the total number of cards:**
   - Total number of cards = number of red cards + number of green cards + number of yellow cards.
   - Total number of cards = \( 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \).

The total number of cards is 78.

"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - 2 boxes, each 1 pound.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags, each 12 pounds.
   - Total weight of carrots = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales, each 75 pounds.
   - Total weight of hay = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks, each 65 pounds.
   - Total weight of oats = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Next, we sum the weights of all the feed:
- Total weight of all feed = 2 (sugar cubes) + 48 (carrots) + 3150 (hay) + 1300 (oats) = 4500 pounds.

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since partial trips are not possible).

- Number of trips = 4500 / 2250 = 2.

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To determine how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats.

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set up the equation:
\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to isolate \( c \):
\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have five cookies.

"To determine how long Jason needs to spend walking each day to break in his new shoes, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days Jason has to break in the shoes.
   - Jason has 3 weeks to break in the shoes.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of days is \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.

2. Determine how many days Jason will actually walk.
   - Jason can walk 4 days a week.
   - Over 3 weeks, the total number of walking days is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) days.

3. Calculate the total time Jason needs to walk to break in the shoes.
   - It takes 240 minutes to break in the shoes.

4. Determine the time Jason needs to walk each day.
   - The total time (240 minutes) needs to be divided by the number of walking days (12 days).
   - Therefore, the time per day is \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{12 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ minutes/day} \).

"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find out how many kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( B \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

From the problem, we know:
- \( |A| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |B| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |A \cap B| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

We need to find the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both, which is \( |A \cup B| \).

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion:
\[ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| \]
\[ |A \cup B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both.

To find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to either or both from the total number of kids in the class:
\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = 32 - |A \cup B| \]
\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Thus, the number of kids not allergic to anything is 20.

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation where the total cost for each venue is the same.

Let \( x \) be the number of guests.

**Cost for the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost for the second venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We set the total costs equal to each other to find the number of guests \( x \) where the costs are the same:

\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

"Let's denote the number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi as \( L \), \( D \), and \( B \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following equations:

1. \( L + D + B = 43 \) (total insects collected)
2. \( L = D + 7 \) (Lily found 7 more than David)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \) (David found half of what Bodhi found)

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \) using the third equation:
\[ B = 2D \]

Next, substitute \( B = 2D \) and \( L = D + 7 \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, substitute \( D = 9 \) back into the equations to find \( L \) and \( B \):
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to determine the quantities based on the information that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought, we can set up the following equations:

Let \( x \) be the number of onions Sophia bought.
Let \( y \) be the number of potatoes Sophia bought.

According to the problem:
\[ 4x = 12 \]
\[ 4y = 4 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

Solving for \( y \):
\[ y = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]

"To determine Andy's daily calorie deficit, we first need to calculate the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th. 

1. From January 1 to July 19:
   - January has 31 days.
   - February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year).
   - March has 31 days.
   - April has 30 days.
   - May has 31 days.
   - June has 30 days.
   - July 1 to July 19 is 19 days.

Adding these together:
31 (January) + 28 (February) + 31 (March) + 30 (April) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 19 (July) = 200 days

Next, we calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 lbs.:
30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105,000 calories

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories by the number of days:
105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories/day

Therefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of 525 calories to reach his goal.

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the expression for \( H \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find the cost of the lot, we divide both sides by 4:

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the cost of the house is:

\[ 90,000 \]"

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially:

- Ali has four $10 bills, which is \(4 \times 10 = 40\) dollars.
- Ali has six $20 bills, which is \(6 \times 20 = 120\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money Ali has is:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

This means Ali is left with:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, Ali uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner:

"To solve this problem, let's break down the picking rates for each person:

1. **Tony's rate**: Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
2. **Bobby's rate**: Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby picks \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
3. **Kathy's rate**: Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy picks \(2 \times 5 = 10\) quarts per hour.
4. **Ricky's rate**: Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so Ricky picks \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up the total number of quarts picked per hour by all four:

"Let's start by defining the variables and relationships given in the problem.

Let \( C_O \) be the number of chairs Ophelia has, and \( S_O \) be the number of sofas Ophelia has. According to the problem, Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so:
\[ S_O = C_O - 2 \]

We are given that Ophelia has 20 sofas:
\[ S_O = 20 \]

Substituting \( S_O \) into the equation:
\[ 20 = C_O - 2 \]
\[ C_O = 22 \]

Next, let \( C_J \) be the number of chairs Jenna has, and \( S_J \) be the number of sofas Jenna has. The problem states that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia:
\[ C_J = 3 \times C_O \]
\[ C_J = 3 \times 22 \]
\[ C_J = 66 \]

Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs:
\[ S_J = C_J - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 66 - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 64 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together. The total number of sofas is:
\[ S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84 \]

The total number of chairs is:
\[ C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88 \]

Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly saving target of $1125.

1. **Determine the number of days in April:**
   April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves:**
   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.**
   - Therefore, the total savings in the first half of April is \( 15x \).

4. **Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half.**
   - So, the amount saved each day in the second half is \( 2x \).
   - Therefore, the total savings in the second half of April is \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

5. **Set up the equation to meet the monthly saving target:**
   \[
   15x + 30x = 1125

"Let's denote the amount Brad gets as \( B \). According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \).

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ B = 20 \]

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

"To find the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag, we can break the problem into two parts:

1. Calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes.
2. Calculate the number of holes in the buttons with four holes.

First, we know there are 7 buttons with two holes each. So, the total number of holes in these buttons is:
\[ 7 \text{ buttons} \times 2 \text{ holes per button} = 14 \text{ holes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many buttons have four holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have two holes, the number of buttons with four holes is:
\[ 21 \text{ buttons} - 7 \text{ buttons} = 14 \text{ buttons} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of holes in the buttons with four holes:
\[ 14 \text{ buttons} \times 4 \text{ holes per button} = 56 \text{ holes} \]

Finally, we add the number of holes from both types of buttons to get the total number of holes:

"To determine how much James spends on candles, we first need to calculate the total number of candles he needs. 

1. The age of the older son is 12.
2. The younger son is 4 years younger, so his age is \(12 - 4 = 8\).

Next, we add the ages of both sons to find the total number of candles required:
\[ 12 + 8 = 20 \]

Each pack of candles contains 5 candles and costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack:
\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

Since each pack costs $3, the total cost for 4 packs is:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \]

Therefore, James spends $12 on candles.

"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- Therefore, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we need to convert the total reading time into the number of pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- The number of pages she reads per minute is \( \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \).

Now, we calculate the number of pages read in the first week:
- Total pages in the first week = \( 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \).

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \). According to the problem, Shiloh is 44 years old today, so \( S = 44 \).

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \), and his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \). The problem states that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This can be expressed with the equation:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substituting \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Next, we solve for \( N \):
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off when set to 450 degrees. The actual temperature is 468 degrees, so the oven is overheating by 18 degrees.

The percentage increase can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Temperature} - \text{Set Temperature}}{\text{Set Temperature}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is overheating by 4%. To find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to when her recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to account for this 4% increase.

Let \( x \) be the temperature she should set the oven to. The actual temperature will be \( x \) plus 4% of \( x \):
\[ \text{Actual Temperature} = x + 0.04x = 1.04x \]

We want the actual temperature to be 520 degrees:
\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set the oven to 500 degrees.

"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, the first movie is:
1 hour * 60 minutes/hour + 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
2 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Adding the durations of the two movies together:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

"First, let's calculate the total cost for 2 boxes of contacts with the 10% discount. 

The original price for 2 boxes is:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

The discount is 10%, so the discount amount is:
\[ 200 \times 0.10 = 20 \]

The total cost after the discount is:
\[ 200 - 20 = 180 \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of contacts in 2 boxes:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Since 90 contacts last Pete 45 days, 180 contacts will last:
\[ 45 \times 2 = 90 \text{ days} \]

Now, we calculate the cost per contact:
\[ \frac{180}{180} = 1 \]

Therefore, the cost per contact is:
\[ \frac{180}{180} = 1 \]

Finally, since each pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts, the cost per pair is:
\[ 1 \times 2 = 2 \]

"First, let's calculate the total calories burned by Hannah.

For aerobics:
- She burns 500 calories per hour.
- She does aerobics for 2 hours.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 500 calories/hour * 2 hours = 1000 calories.

For running:
- She burns 600 calories per hour.
- She runs for 1 hour.
- Total calories burned from running = 600 calories/hour * 1 hour = 600 calories.

Total calories burned = 1000 calories (aerobics) + 600 calories (running) = 1600 calories.

Now, we need to calculate the amount of water she needs to drink based on the total calories burned.

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned.
- Total water needed = (1600 calories / 200 calories) * 100 ml = 800 ml.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \) (1% fewer than blue) and the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \) (1% more than blue).

The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining the terms on the left side:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- Number of red jelly beans: \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Number of green jelly beans: \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the total protein intake per day.
3. Multiply the daily protein intake by the number of days in a week.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms will contain:
\[ 200 \text{ grams} \times \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams}} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, so he gets 6 grams of protein per day.

Next, to find the total protein intake per week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ 6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams/week} \]

So, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms.

"To determine how many hours George needs to work to pay for his dental work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work and then figure out how much more he needs to pay after his deposit.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the dental work:**
   - Each implant has a base price of $2000.
   - George needs 2 implants, so the cost for the implants is:
     \[
     2 \times 2000 = 4000 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - One of the implants will have a porcelain crown, which costs an extra $500.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the dental work is:
     \[
     4000 + 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Subtract the deposit from the total cost:**
   - George has already paid a deposit of $600.
   - The remaining amount he needs to pay is:
     \[
     4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine how many hours George needs to work to earn the remaining amount:**
   - George earns $15 per hour.
   - The number of hours he needs to work to earn $3900 is:
     \[
     \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours to have enough money to pay for the dental work.

"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, which is \( 2x \), and another angle is three times the smallest angle, which is \( 3x \).

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = 30 \]

The largest angle is \( 3x \):
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Thus, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one month.
2. Determine the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one year.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for the tires to reach the maximum number of rotations before they need to be replaced.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations in one month.**

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. Every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. 

First, find out how many 2-mile segments are in 400 miles:
\[ \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/segment}} = 200 \text{ segments} \]

Next, calculate the total number of rotations in one month:
\[ 200 \text{ segments} \times 725 \text{ rotations/segment} = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of rotations in one year.**

There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many years it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations.**

Divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the number of rotations per year:
\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the tire will need to be replaced in 6 years.

"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into two parts: the initial 5 months and the additional months.

1. **Initial 5 months:**
   - Funding per month: $100,000 / 5 = $20,000
   - Total cost for 5 months: $20,000 * 5 = $100,000

2. **Additional months:**
   - Total research time: 10 times the initial 5 months = 50 months
   - Additional months: 50 months - 5 months = 45 months
   - Funding per month for additional months: $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000
   - Total cost for additional 45 months: $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000

3. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost for initial 5 months + Cost for additional 45 months
   - Total cost = $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000

"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. Calculate the total number of loads Gary does in a week.
2. Determine the total number of loads he does in a year.
3. Calculate the total amount of water used in a year.
4. Find out the total cost of the water used in a year.

Step 1: Gary does laundry twice a week, so he does 2 loads per week.

Step 2: There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ loads/year} \]

Step 3: Each load uses 20 gallons of water, so the total amount of water used in a year is:

"To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of meat Prince sells in one day.
2. Divide the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells in one day to find the number of days required.

First, we calculate the total amount of meat Prince sells in one day:
- Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour.
- He works 10 hours a day.
- Therefore, the total amount of meat he sells in one day is \( 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \).

Next, we divide the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells in one day:
- The bull weighs 750 kg.
- The number of days required to sell the meat is \( \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \).

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

"First, let's calculate how many pieces of gum Jim chews during the school day. Since he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours and the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews:

8 hours / 2 hours per piece = 4 pieces of gum

Additionally, he chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so in total, he chews:

4 pieces (at school) + 1 piece (on the way home) + 1 piece (after dinner) = 6 pieces of gum

Starting with a 20-pack of gum, after chewing 6 pieces, he has:

20 pieces - 6 pieces = 14 pieces of gum

Jim then gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives away:

14 pieces / 2 = 7 pieces

Therefore, the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is:

14 pieces - 7 pieces = 7 pieces

"To find the total number of cars towed by the truck in the week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of cars towed in the first three days and the number of cars towed in the remaining four days.

1. For the first three days, the truck towed 10 cars each day. Therefore, the total number of cars towed in these three days is:
   \[
   10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
   \]

2. For the remaining four days, the truck towed four fewer cars each day compared to the first three days. So, the number of cars towed each day for these four days is:
   \[
   10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day}
   \]
   Therefore, the total number of cars towed in these four days is:
   \[
   6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars}
   \]

3. Adding the totals from both parts gives us the total number of cars towed in the week:

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we first need to convert the height requirement from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the height requirement of 4 feet is:

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Adam is currently 40 inches tall and grows 2 inches each year. We need to find out how many years it will take for him to reach 48 inches. We can set up the equation:

40 inches + 2 inches/year * number of years = 48 inches

Solving for the number of years:

2 inches/year * number of years = 48 inches - 40 inches
2 inches/year * number of years = 8 inches
number of years = 8 inches / 2 inches/year
number of years = 4

So, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.
2. Determine the total cost of acquiring the cars.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.
4. Calculate James's commission based on the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.**

James sold 10 cars, each costing $25,000.
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the total cost of acquiring the cars.**

The company paid 30% of the selling price to acquire each car.
\[ \text{Cost per Car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit.**

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

**Step 4: Calculate James's commission.**

James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
\[ \text{Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

Therefore, James made:

First, we know that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright:
\[ 25\% \times 100 = 0.25 \times 100 = 25 \text{ riders} \]

Next, 60% of these 25 riders are women:
\[ 60\% \times 25 = 0.60 \times 25 = 15 \text{ women} \]

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \text{ men} \]

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between them. 

First, we find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob. Tom's speed is 70 miles per hour, and Bob's speed is 55 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. 

Next, we need to find out how long it will take Tom to close the 75-mile gap at this rate. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we first need to determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught as follows:

Darren's fish = Naomi's fish - 6
Darren's fish = 17 - 6
Darren's fish = 11

Now, since Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, we can calculate the number of fish Tommy caught as follows:

Tommy's fish = Darren's fish + 3
Tommy's fish = 11 + 3
Tommy's fish = 14

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we need to calculate the cost per class based on the number of classes he attends.

The total cost for the classes is $60. If Manny attends all 10 classes, the cost per class is:
\[ \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars per class} \]

If Manny misses some classes, the number of classes he attends will be less than 10, and the cost per class will increase. We need to find the maximum number of classes he can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10.

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny misses. Then, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \). The cost per class is:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We set up the inequality to ensure the cost per class does not exceed $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) it will take him to shovel 72 cubic feet is:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} \]
\[ T = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

So, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

2. Steve's wife is 4 years older than him, so she is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.
3. Their son is currently half as old as his mom, so the son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.
4. Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so she is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

Therefore, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old.

For Stanley:
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours
Distance = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances:
Total distance = Distance by Alisa + Distance by Stanley
Total distance = 54 miles + 25 miles
Total distance = 79 miles

"To determine the total time Bill will take to dig the well, we need to calculate the time spent digging through both the soil and the clay separately and then sum these times.

1. **Time to dig through the soil:**
   - Bill digs 4 feet per hour through soil.
   - He needs to dig through 24 feet of soil.
   - Time = Distance / Rate = 24 feet / 4 feet per hour = 6 hours.

2. **Time to dig through the clay:**
   - Bill digs at half the rate through clay, which is 4 feet per hour / 2 = 2 feet per hour.
   - He needs to dig through 8 feet of clay.
   - Time = Distance / Rate = 8 feet / 2 feet per hour = 4 hours.

3. **Total time to dig the well:**
   - Total time = Time through soil + Time through clay = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400.
   - The sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats were \( 2 \times 400 = 800 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first month:**
   - Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total sales in the first month = \( 400 + 800 = 1200 \) dollars.

3. **Determine the sales for the second month:**
   - In the second month, her sales were \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total sales of the first month.
   - Sales in the second month = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total sales for two months:**
   - Total sales for two months = Sales in the first month + Sales in the second month
   - Total sales for two months = \( 1200 + 900 = 2100 \) dollars.

The total amount Ariadne made in two months is \( 2100 \) dollars.

"To determine how much James paid for the horse-drawn carriage, we need to break down the costs based on the given conditions.

1. **Total Time**: James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours in total.
2. **Free Hour**: He gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.
3. **Cost Structure**:
   - The first paid hour costs $15.
   - Each subsequent hour costs twice the previous hour.

Let's calculate the cost for each paid hour:
- First paid hour: $15
- Second paid hour: $15 * 2 = $30
- Third paid hour: $30 * 2 = $60

Now, we sum up the costs for the 3 paid hours:
\[ 15 + 30 + 60 = 105 \]

Therefore, the total amount James paid is:
\[ 105 \]

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:
   Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and there are 16 guests.
   \[
   3 \text{ deviled egg halves/guest} \times 16 \text{ guests} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves}
   \]

2. Determine the number of whole eggs required:
   Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many whole eggs are needed to make 48 deviled egg halves.
   \[
   \frac{48 \text{ deviled egg halves}}{2 \text{ deviled egg halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs}
   \]

3. Convert the number of whole eggs to dozens:
   There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
   \[
   \frac{24 \text{ whole eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozens}
   \]

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs.

"To calculate the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly hanger rental, and the monthly fuel expenses.

1. Initial cost of the plane: $150,000
2. Monthly hanger rental: $5,000
3. Monthly fuel cost: $5,000 * 2 = $10,000

Next, we calculate the total monthly maintenance cost:
- Monthly maintenance cost (hanger + fuel) = $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000

Then, we calculate the total maintenance cost for the year:
- Annual maintenance cost = $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the annual maintenance cost:
- Total cost for the first year = $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000

$330,000"
"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.
2. It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. Therefore, the cooking time for pork is \(30 + 20 = 50\) minutes.
3. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is \(30 + 50 = 80\) minutes. Therefore, the cooking time for beans is \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) minutes.

Now, to find the total cooking time for all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans:
\[ 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \]

Thus, the total cooking time is 120 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

1. Each animal has one head, so the total number of heads gives us the equation:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]

2. Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs, so the total number of legs gives us the equation:
   \[
   4S + 2G = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
   \[
   2S + G = 35
   \]

Now we have the system of equations:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]
   \[
   2S + G = 35
   \]

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
   \[
   (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20
   \]
   \[
   2S + G - S - G = 15
   \]
   \[
   S = 15

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Days in the Month**: 30 days.
2. **Good Days in the First 30 Days**: 12 days.
3. **Bad Days in the First 30 Days**: 8 days.
4. **Neutral Days in the First 30 Days**: The rest of the days, which is \(30 - 12 - 8 = 10\) days.

Next, we need to consider the distribution of these days over the first 24 days:
- **First 8 Days**: All good.
- **Next 8 Days**: All bad.
- **Next 8 Days**: All neutral.

So, the first 24 days are:
- 8 good days (first 8 days)
- 8 bad days (next 8 days)
- 8 neutral days (next 8 days)

Now, we need to account for the next three days:
- The next day is good.
- The day after that is neutral.
- The day after that is good.

So, the next three days are:
- 1 good day
- 1 neutral day
- 1 good day

Adding these to the first 24 days:
- Total good days: \(8 + 1 + 1 = 10\)
- Total bad days: 8
- Total neutral days: \(8 + 1 = 9\)

Since the month has 30 days, and we have already accounted for 27 days, there are 3 days left in the month. We need to determine how many of these remaining days are good.

Given the pattern and the information provided, the remaining 3 days are not specified, but we can infer that they are not part of the initial 27 days. Since the problem does not provide any additional information about these days, we assume they are not good, bad, or neutral (i.e., they are not part of the initial distribution).

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is:

\[ 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]

Calculating the sum:
\[ 68 + 73 = 141 \]
\[ 141 + 61 = 202 \]
\[ 202 + 96 = 298 \]

Therefore, the total number of cookies they have is 298.

"To find the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length by \( L \). According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds an additional 20 cm of lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

First, we express the extended length of the dress before adding the lace trim:
\[ L + 0.5L = 1.5L \]

Next, we add the 20 cm of lace trim to this extended length:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Now, we solve for \( L \):
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]
\[ 1.5L = 140 - 20 \]
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]
\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ L = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes Chris to mow half of his lawn in each mode and then sum these times.

1. **Turtle Mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes).
   - Therefore, to mow half of the lawn, it would take him \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) minutes.

2. **Rabbit Mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes.
   - Therefore, to mow half of the lawn, it would take him \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) minutes.

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to mow the lawn by using both modes is the sum of the times for each half.
   - Total time = 30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes.

"To find out how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to calculate the total time they have already spent walking and subtract that from the total time they have to reach school.

First, we add the time it takes to get to the corner where the library is and the time it takes to get to the fire station:
6 minutes (to the library) + 13 minutes (to the fire station) = 19 minutes

Next, we subtract the total time spent walking so far from the total time they have to get to school:
30 minutes (total time) - 19 minutes (time spent) = 11 minutes

Therefore, John and Jack have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( R \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write:

\[ T = R + 7 \]

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. Since there are two twins and three triplets, we can write the equation for their combined ages as:

\[ 2T + 3R = 44 \]

Now, substitute \( T = R + 7 \) into the combined age equation:

\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Simplify and solve for \( R \):

\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( R = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = R + 7 \):

\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of each candy. We know the total cost of five lollipops and four candies is $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40, so the total cost for the lollipops is:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

This means the cost of the four candies is:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

So, the cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost for 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost for 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many coins Neil saves each month compared to Rong.

Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. This means Neil saves:
\[ 20 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \right) \]
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each of them saves over ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so over ten years, there are:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong's total savings over ten years:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings over ten years:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding both totals together gives the combined savings:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the vaccines:**
   - John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20.
   - Total cost for vaccines = 2 * $20 = $40.

2. **Determine the total bill:**
   - Let the total bill be \( T \).
   - The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so the cost of the heartworm check is \( 0.60T \).

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check.
   - Therefore, \( T = 40 + 0.60T \).

4. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - \( T - 0.60T = 40 \)
   - \( 0.40T = 40 \)
   - \( T = \frac{40}{0.40} \)
   - \( T = 100 \)

5. **Calculate how much John leaves with:**
   - John brought $125 with him.
   - He spends $100 on the vet bill.
   - Amount left = $125 - $100 = $25.

So, John leaves with $25.

1. **Cost of bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Cost of apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Cost of oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as one banana.
   - One banana costs $1, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in the crate, so the total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

4. **Total cost of the crate:**
   - Sum the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges: \(5 + 6 + 21 = 32\) dollars.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, making the total number of people:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person saves a seat, and each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks. Therefore, for 20 seats, the total number of drinks and snacks is:

\[ 20 \text{ seats} \times 2 \text{ drinks/seat} = 40 \text{ drinks} \]
\[ 20 \text{ seats} \times 3 \text{ snacks/seat} = 60 \text{ snacks} \]

The total number of drinks and snacks combined is:

First, let's find the production rate for chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Next, let's find the production rate for vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Now, we calculate the total production for each type of ice cream over 48 hours:
- For chocolate ice cream: \( 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).
- For vanilla ice cream: \( 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

"To find out how much each roommate, including Jenna, will pay per year for electricity, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total monthly cost of electricity: $100.
2. Divide the monthly cost by the number of roommates (including Jenna) to find the monthly cost per person: \( \frac{100}{5} = 20 \) dollars per person.
3. Multiply the monthly cost per person by the number of months in a year to find the annual cost per person: \( 20 \times 12 = 240 \) dollars per person.

Thus, each roommate will pay $240 per year for electricity.

"To determine how many glasses and plates Jeff has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial number of glasses and plates sent.
2. Subtract the number of broken items from the initial number.

First, convert dozens to individual items:
- 8 dozen glasses = 8 * 12 = 96 glasses
- 4 dozen plates = 4 * 12 = 48 plates

Next, subtract the broken items:
- Broken glasses = 10
- Broken plates = 6

So, the remaining items are:
- Remaining glasses = 96 - 10 = 86 glasses
- Remaining plates = 48 - 6 = 42 plates

Finally, add the remaining glasses and plates to get the total number of items Jeff has now:
- Total remaining items = 86 + 42 = 128

"To solve this problem, we need to break down the transactions step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading 90% of Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 27 small buttons = 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

3. **Trading 50% of Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

4. **Trading the Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - The remaining 20 large stickers are traded for small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 3 small stickers + 60 small buttons = 63 small buttons.

5. **Total Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 9 large buttons from the first trade.
   - Lorraine has 63 small buttons from the second trade.
   - Total buttons = 9 large buttons + 63 small buttons.

Since the problem asks for the total number of buttons, we need to convert all buttons to the same type. However, since the problem does not specify a conversion for the final count, we can assume the total is the sum of both types of buttons.

Total buttons = 9 + 63 = 72

"Let's denote the number of votes in favor of the new regulation as \( F \) and the number of votes against it as \( A \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, which can be expressed as:
\[ F = 2A \]

The total number of people on the council is 33, so the total number of votes is also 33. This can be expressed as:
\[ F + A = 33 \]

We can substitute \( F = 2A \) into the second equation:
\[ 2A + A = 33 \]
\[ 3A = 33 \]
\[ A = 11 \]

Now, substituting \( A = 11 \) back into the equation \( F = 2A \):
\[ F = 2 \times 11 \]
\[ F = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \). According to the problem:

- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs half of the second).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the third house needs double the first).

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases, so:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Thus, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the Llesis family traveled, which includes both the distance they drove and the distance they hiked.

First, let's determine the speed at which they hiked. The problem states that they hiked at an average speed of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Since they drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour, half of this speed is 25 miles per hour. Therefore, their hiking speed is:
\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Distance hiked} = 1.5 \times 20 = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to find out how long they drove. The total travel time was 6 hours, and they spent 1.5 hours hiking, so the time spent driving is:
\[ 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 \text{ hours} \]

The distance they drove is calculated by multiplying the driving time by their driving speed:
\[ \text{Distance driven} = 4.5 \times 50 = 225 \text{ miles} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Bob had:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

After buying 17 more fish from the pet store, the total number of fish Bob has is:
- 3 + 4 + 17 = 24 fish

Let \( x \) be the number of white fish Bob bought from the store. Then, the number of orange fish he bought is \( 17 - x \).

After adding the new fish, the total number of white fish Bob has is:
- 4 + \( x \)

The total number of orange fish Bob has is:
- 3 + (17 - \( x \)) = 20 - \( x \)

According to the problem, Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish:
- 20 - \( x \) = 2(4 + \( x \))

Solving the equation:
20 - \( x \) = 8 + 2\( x \)
20 - 8 = 2\( x \) + \( x \)
12 = 3\( x \)
\( x \) = 4

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

4. Calculate the total cost of the gas used per week by multiplying the total amount of gas used by the price per gallon.

Let's go through these steps:

1. One-way distance to work is 5 miles, so the round trip (to and from work) is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles per day.
2. Andy works 5 days a week, so the total weekly distance is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.
3. Andy's car has a fuel efficiency of 10 miles per gallon, so the total amount of gas used per week is 50 miles / 10 miles per gallon = 5 gallons/week.
4. The price of gas is $3 per gallon, so the total cost of gas per week is 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week.

Therefore, the total amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carrie spent on lunch, which includes the quarters and a portion of the twenties.

First, let's calculate the total value of the quarters:
- Each quarter is worth $0.25.
- Carrie has 140 quarters.
- The total value of the quarters is \( 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total value of the twenties:
- Each twenty is worth $20.
- Carrie has 10 twenties.
- The total value of the twenties is \( 10 \times 20 = 200 \) dollars.

Carrie spent \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the twenties:
- \( \frac{3}{5} \) of 200 dollars is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \) dollars.

Now, we add the value of the quarters and the portion of the twenties she spent:
- Total amount spent = value of quarters + value of spent twenties
- Total amount spent = 35 + 120 = 155 dollars

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:

- Therefore, the total number of tomatoes is \( 22 \times 5 = 110 \).

Next, we calculate the total number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.
- Therefore, the total number of eggplants is \( 4 \times 8 = 32 \).

Finally, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:
- Total number of fruits = 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits.

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy to make them 30% of her total collection, we first need to calculate the current total number of stuffed animals she has.

Bubbles has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

The total number of stuffed animals she currently has is:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be:
\[ 14 + x \]

We want the number of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

To solve for \( x \), we first distribute the 0.30:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To find the school's overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students who took the test, then divide the number of students who passed by the total number of students.

First, let's determine the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third grade: 340 out of 500 students passed.
- Fourth grade: 40 out of 100 students passed.
- Fifth grade: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth grade. The fourth grade pass rate is 40/100 = 0.40 (or 40%). Therefore, the fifth grade pass rate is 2 * 0.40 = 0.80 (or 80%). So, 80% of 400 fifth graders passed, which is 0.80 * 400 = 320 students.

Next, we sum the number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total students who passed: 340 (third grade) + 40 (fourth grade) + 320 (fifth grade) = 700 students.
- Total students who took the test: 500 (third grade) + 100 (fourth grade) + 400 (fifth grade) = 1000 students.

Now, we calculate the overall pass rate:

\[ \text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{\text{Total students who passed}}{\text{Total students who took the test}} = \frac{700}{1000} = 0.70 \]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[ 0.70 \times 100 = 70\% \]

The school's overall pass rate is 70%.

\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 2s + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]

Substitute \( s = 2z \) into the equation:
\[ 2z + 4(2z) = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 8z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, substitute \( z = 1 \) back to find \( s \):
\[ s = 2z = 2(1) = 2 \]

The amount of oil is:
\[ 2s = 2(2) = 4 \]

So, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

"To find out how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 goats at $500 each is:
3 goats * $500/goat = $1500

The cost of 2 cows at $1500 each is:
2 cows * $1500/cow = $3000

Adding the cost of the goats and the cows together gives us the total amount spent:
$1500 + $3000 = $4500

"If Robert has 20 cars, Joe has twice as many, which means Joe has 40 cars.

Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 cars is:
\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold, so he gives away:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

The total number of cars Joe gets rid of is:
\[ 8 + 16 = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Therefore, the number of cars Joe remains with is:
\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount raised by the students. The total amount raised for the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of this amount comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Since there are 20 students, and they each earned the same amount, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

Each student raised $6,250.

"To find the total time Sandy took to walk over the two days in minutes, we first need to calculate the total time in hours and then convert it to minutes.

1. On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours.
2. On the second day, she walked for half as many hours as the first day, which is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) hours.

Now, we add the hours from both days:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we convert the total hours to minutes. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:

"To find out how much John makes in a full 7-day week, we need to calculate the total earnings based on the number of cycles, tasks per cycle, and the pay per task.

1. First, calculate the total number of tasks John completes in one day:
   \[
   \text{Tasks per day} = \text{Cycles per day} \times \text{Tasks per cycle} = 30 \times 5 = 150
   \]

2. Next, calculate the daily earnings:
   \[
   \text{Daily earnings} = \text{Tasks per day} \times \text{Pay per task} = 150 \times 1.20 = 180
   \]

3. Finally, calculate the weekly earnings:
   \[
   \text{Weekly earnings} = \text{Daily earnings} \times \text{Days per week} = 180 \times 7 = 1260
   \]

So, John makes $1260 in a full 7-day week.

"To find out how many total points Sasha scored during both games, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.
2. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points.
3. In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.

Now, we add the points Sasha scored in both games:
- First game: 14 points
- Second game: 4 points

Total points scored by Sasha: \(14 + 4 = 18\)

"To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we first calculate the total number of tins for each type of food.

For cat food:
8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins

For dog food:
6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins

Now, we find the difference between the number of tins of cat food and dog food:
88 tins - 36 tins = 52 tins

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards each person has:
- PJ has \( P = 47 \) cards.
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

So, Becca has 153 cards.

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and the amount of the refund she will receive from Amazon.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The shipping cost is based on the weight of the book and the distance to the distribution center.
   - The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
     \[
     \text{Cost per pound} = 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40
     \]
   - The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
     \[
     \text{Cost per mile} = 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60
     \]
   - The total shipping cost is the sum of the cost per pound and the cost per mile.
     \[
     \text{Total shipping cost} = \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00
     \]

2. **Calculate the refund amount:**
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price.
   - The book cost $32.
     \[
     \text{Refund amount} = 0.75 \times \$32 = \$24.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - The net loss is the difference between the book's purchase price and the refund amount, plus the shipping cost.
     \[
     \text{Net loss} = (\$32 - \$24) + \$3 = \$8 + \$3 = \$11

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and then calculate the time it takes for the turtles to travel the same distance.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( v \) (distance per hour).
   - Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel the distance, the total distance \( D \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     D = 3 \times v \times 18
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     D = 54v
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

3. **Calculate the time for 4 turtles to travel the same distance:**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is given by:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{2v}
     \]
   - Substituting \( D = 54v \) into the equation:
     \[
     T = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27
     \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel the same distance.

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after all contributions and then subtract the cost of the laptop after the trade-in.

1. The original cost of the laptop is $600.
2. The trade-in reduces the price by $200, so the new cost is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
4. Her mom gives her $80.
5. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \).

The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of her purse money, her part-time job earnings, and the money from her mom:
\[ x + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount is $50 less than the cost of the laptop after the trade-in:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first calculate the total milk production with the current number of cows.

The farmer currently has 3 cows, and each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day. Therefore, the total milk production per day is:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows required is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years using the formula for simple interest:

\[ A = P + (P \times r \times t) \]

where:
- \( A \) is the total amount after interest,
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial investment),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate,
- \( t \) is the time in years.

Given:
- \( P = 300 \) dollars,
- The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which means \( r = \frac{3}{4} \) of \( P \) per year. However, the interest rate should be a fraction of the principal, so \( r = \frac{3}{4} \) or 0.75,
- \( t = 3 \) years.

First, calculate the interest earned over 3 years:

\[ \text{Interest} = P \times r \times t = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3 \]

\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \]

\[ \text{Interest} = 675 \]

Now, add the interest to the principal to find the total amount:

\[ A = P + \text{Interest} = 300 + 675 \]

\[ A = 975 \]

So, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:

- Initially, Farm X had 55 goats. After selling 10, the remaining goats in Farm X are \(55 - 10 = 45\).
- Initially, Farm Y had 45 goats. After selling 20, the remaining goats in Farm Y are \(45 - 20 = 25\).

Finally, we add the remaining goats from both farms to find the total:
- Total remaining goats = 45 (from Farm X) + 25 (from Farm Y) = 70.

"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent on shoes by the total number of pairs bought.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, so in a year (which has 12 months), he buys:
2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

He spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount spent by the number of pairs:
$2640 / 24 pairs = $110 per pair

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the baskets, taking into account the discount for the red food baskets.

1. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food:
   - Each basket of green food costs $25.
   - Therefore, 3 baskets of green food cost \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

2. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount:
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - You get $2 off for each basket of red food, so each basket of red food effectively costs \( 18 - 2 = 16 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, 3 baskets of red food cost \( 3 \times 16 = 48 \) dollars.

3. Add the costs of the green and red food baskets to get the total cost:
   - Total cost = Cost of green food baskets + Cost of red food baskets
   - Total cost = \( 75 + 48 = 123 \) dollars.

So, the total amount you will have to pay is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many rooms are in one-half of the total rooms at the KozyInn Motel. 

The total number of rooms is 90. One-half of 90 rooms is:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total time it takes to clean 45 rooms. It takes 20 minutes to clean each room, so for 45 rooms, the total time in minutes is:
\[ 45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{900}{60} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we can break down the problem year by year.

1. In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year. Therefore, they will build \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
3. In the third year, they will count the total number of homes built in the first two years and then double that amount. The total number of homes built in the first two years is \(12 + 36 = 48\). Doubling this amount gives \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Now, we add the number of homes built each year to find the total number of homes built over the three years:
\[12 + 36 + 96 = 144\]

"Let's denote the ages as follows:
- My age: \( x \)
- My brother's age: \( x + 3 \)
- My sister's age: \( x - 2 \)
- My mom's age: \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \)

The sum of all our ages is given as 87. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87 \]

Simplify the equation step by step:

\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 6x = 78 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ x = 13 \]

So, I am 13 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people infected each day, starting with the initial 10 people infected.

- **Day 0**: 10 people are initially infected.
- **Day 1**: Each of the 10 people infects 6 others, so \(10 \times 6 = 60\) new people are infected. The total number of infected people is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
- **Day 2**: Each of the 70 people infects 6 others, so \(70 \times 6 = 420\) new people are infected. The total number of infected people is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
- **Day 3**: Each of the 490 people infects 6 others, so \(490 \times 6 = 2940\) new people are infected. The total number of infected people is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

Thus, after three days, the total number of people infected is 3430.

"First, let's calculate how much money Rafaela received in tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate Rafaela's total tips as follows:

\[ \text{Rafaela's total tips} = 40 \times 20 = 800 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract this amount from Rafaela's total to find Julieta's total tips:

\[ \text{Julieta's total tips} = 800 - 80 = 720 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's total tips to find the combined amount:

\[ \text{Total tips} = 800 + 720 = 1520 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Claire's Badge Earnings:**
   - Claire earns 1 badge every month.
   - In 1 year (12 months), Claire earns \( 1 \times 12 = 12 \) badges.

2. **Amber's Badge Earnings:**
   - Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire.
   - Therefore, Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months.
   - In 1 year (12 months), Amber earns \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) badges.

3. **Wendy's Badge Earnings:**
   - Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.
   - In 1 year, Wendy earns \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) badges.

4. **Difference in Badge Earnings:**
   - We need to find how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber.
   - Wendy earns 36 badges, and Amber earns 6 badges.
   - The difference is \( 36 - 6 = 30 \) badges.

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame.

"To determine how much Paige raised, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Paige baked.
2. Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked.
3. Calculate the total number of slices from the loaves.
4. Calculate the total amount of money raised from selling all the slices.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Paige baked.
Paige baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours.

Step 2: Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked.
Paige can bake 2 loaves per hour. Over 5 hours, she baked:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

"To find the number of yellow cars, let's break down the information given:

1. There are 12 red cars.
2. The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of green cars} = 12 - 2 = 10
   \]
3. The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of blue cars} = 3 \times 10 = 30
   \]
4. The total number of cars is 75. We can set up the equation to find the number of yellow cars:
   \[
   \text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - (\text{Number of red cars} + \text{Number of green cars} + \text{Number of blue cars})
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[

"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as \( A \), the number of books that Sofie has as \( S \), and the number of books that Fawn has as \( F \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (the total number of books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, we can substitute \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now we have expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ S = F + 13 \]
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Next, we substitute these expressions into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many microphones are left without a space to fit in. Since 20% of the microphones won't find any space, we calculate 20% of 50:

\[ 20\% \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

This means 10 microphones are left without a space. Therefore, the number of microphones that were arranged in pairs is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

"To find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we first calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower.

For the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the orchids is \(5 \times 5 = 25\) petals.

For the African daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the daisies is \(4 \times 10 = 40\) petals.

Next, we find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids:
- The difference is \(40 - 25 = 15\) petals.

Thus, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot every day, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the cost of one carrot as \( C \).

The cost of the salad is $6.
The cost of the yogurt is half the price of the salad, so it is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) dollars.

Ellen eats two carrots, so the total cost for the carrots is \( 2C \).

The total cost for all the items she eats every day is $11. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 2C + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2C + 9 = 11 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 2C = 2 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 1 \]

So, the cost of one carrot is \( 1 \) dollar.

"To find out how much Mark makes a week after his pay raise, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine Mark's new hourly wage: His original wage was $10 per hour, and he received a raise of $2 per hour.
   - New hourly wage = $10 + $2 = $12 per hour

2. Calculate the total number of hours Mark works in a week: He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week.
   - Total hours per week = 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week

3. Calculate Mark's weekly earnings with his new hourly wage:
   - Weekly earnings = New hourly wage * Total hours per week
   - Weekly earnings = $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week

Therefore, Mark makes $480 a week.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns and then subtract that from her total earnings to find out how much she made from lemonade sales.

1. **Determine the number of times Tasha mowed each lawn:**
   - Let \( J \) represent the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
   - The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
   - The second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

2. **Calculate the total number of times she mowed lawns:**
   - Total times mowing lawns = \( J + 3J + 5J = 9J \).

3. **Calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.
   - Since \( J \) represents the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn, and she was paid $6 for all her work, we can assume \( J = 1 \) (since the problem does not specify the rate per lawn, we assume the total payment is for all the work done).
   - Therefore, total earnings from mowing lawns = \( 9 \times 6 = 54 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the earnings from lemonade sales:**
   - Total earnings = $80.
   - Earnings from mowing lawns = $54.
   - Earnings from lemonade sales = $80 - $54 = $26.

Thus, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Pages read yesterday:**
   - Denise read 10 pages.
   - Daniel read 13 pages.

2. **Pages read today:**
   - Denise read 5 more pages than what Daniel read yesterday.
   - Daniel read 0 pages today.

3. **Calculate the number of pages Denise read today:**
   - Daniel read 13 pages yesterday.
   - Denise read 5 more than 13 pages today.
   - Therefore, Denise read \( 13 + 5 = 18 \) pages today.

4. **Total pages read by each:**
   - Denise's total pages: \( 10 \) (yesterday) + \( 18 \) (today) = \( 28 \) pages.
   - Daniel's total pages: \( 13 \) (yesterday) + \( 0 \) (today) = \( 13 \) pages.

5. **Difference in the number of pages read:**
   - Denise read \( 28 \) pages.
   - Daniel read \( 13 \) pages.
   - The difference is \( 28 - 13 = 15 \) pages.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bowls of soup are left after Calvin and his family have eaten dinner.

1. The pot contains enough soup to fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.
2. Calvin and his wife are adults, so they will each have 1 adult bowl.
3. Each of the two children will have 1 child bowl.

First, we convert the adult bowls to child bowls to make the calculations easier:
- 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls.
- Therefore, 4 adult bowls are equivalent to \(4 \times 2 = 8\) child bowls.

Now, let's calculate the total number of child bowls used for dinner:
- Calvin and his wife will use \(2 \times 2 = 4\) child bowls (since each adult bowl is 2 child bowls).
- The two children will use \(2 \times 1 = 2\) child bowls.

So, the total number of child bowls used for dinner is:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \]

The pot originally contains 8 child bowls of soup. After dinner, the number of child bowls left is:
\[ 8 - 6 = 2 \]

Since there are 2 child bowls left and 2 children, each child will be able to have:
\[ \frac{2}{2} = 1 \]

Each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

"To find out how much William spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen he bought. 

First, we calculate the cost of the notebooks:
- William bought 5 notebooks.
- Each notebook costs $1.50.
- The total cost for the notebooks is \( 5 \times 1.50 = 7.50 \) dollars.

Next, we calculate the cost of the ballpen:
- William bought 1 ballpen.
- Each ballpen costs $0.50.
- The total cost for the ballpen is \( 1 \times 0.50 = 0.50 \) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen to find the total amount William spent:

"To determine the total amount of material Jo needs, we first calculate the material required for the small and large masks separately.

For the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

For the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Adding the material needed for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours and then calculate the minimum number of berries he must pick per trip to reach a total of 24 berries.

1. **Determine the number of trips in 8 hours:**
   - Each trip takes 4 hours.
   - In 8 hours, the sloth can make \( \frac{8}{4} = 2 \) trips.

2. **Calculate the number of berries per trip:**
   - The sloth needs to collect 24 berries in total.
   - Since he can make 2 trips in 8 hours, he must pick \( \frac{24}{2} = 12 \) berries per trip.

Thus, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours is 12.

"First, we need to determine the initial amount of water in the tank. The tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, which has 10,000 gallons. Therefore, the tank is filled with:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of water used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so over 6 days, the total amount of water used is:

\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

To find the remaining amount of water in the tank after 6 days, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank:

\[ 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

"To determine how much farther the bus went than the car, we first calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

For the bus:
- Speed: 60 miles per hour
- Time: 5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

For the car:
- Speed: 30 miles per hour
- Time: 8 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Next, we find the difference in the distances traveled:
- Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car.

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( L \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + L + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   L = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = L + J
   \]

First, substitute \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( L \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]
\[
4J = 80
\]
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[
L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:

"To find the total number of water balloons, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Maria invited 4 friends, so there are 5 people in total (Maria + 4 friends).
2. At the start, Maria gave each of her friends 2 water balloons. So, the 4 friends received:
   \[
   4 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ balloons per friend} = 8 \text{ balloons}
   \]
3. Maria had 1 water balloon for herself.
4. Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people, the total number of additional balloons is:
   \[
   5 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ balloons per person} = 15 \text{ balloons}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the balloons:
\[
8 \text{ (initial balloons for friends)} + 1 \text{ (initial balloon for Maria)} + 15 \text{ (additional balloons from mom)} = 24 \text{ balloons}
\]

So, the total number of balloons the girls had is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated by the 10 people. Each person donates 5 boxes, so:
\[ 10 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ boxes/person} = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we add the 10 boxes of stuff they already have:
\[ 50 \text{ boxes} + 10 \text{ boxes} = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all 60 boxes, given that each table can hold 2 boxes:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes/table}} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

They already own 15 tables, so the number of new tables needed is:
\[ 30 \text{ tables} - 15 \text{ tables} = 15 \text{ tables} \]

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs, we first calculate the amount of hay required for the goats and the sheep separately.

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. With 15 goats, the total hay needed for the goats is:
\[ 5 \text{ pounds/goat} \times 15 \text{ goats} = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, each sheep needs:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

With 12 sheep, the total hay needed for the sheep is:
\[ 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} \times 12 \text{ sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the hay needed for the goats and the sheep gives the total amount of hay required:

"First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week:
\[ \text{Earnings} = 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the amount he spends on gas:
\[ \text{Remaining after gas} = 300 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 250 \, \text{dollars} \]

Then, we subtract the amount he wants to deposit in the bank:
\[ \text{Remaining after deposit} = 250 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the pencils:

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively. According to the problem, the total points scored by the team is 45, so we have:

\[ B + A + D = 45 \]

We are also given that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar. This gives us the following equations:

\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

We can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):

\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Substituting these expressions into the total points equation:

\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Simplify and solve for \( B \):

\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3B = 75 \]
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):

\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Thus, Azibo scored 5 points.

1. **Total sleep time without interruptions:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - 8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.

2. **Time spent sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - 2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes.

3. **Time she woke up early:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual.
   - Usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.
   - 5 minutes.

4. **Total time subtracted from sleep:**
   - Time spent sleepwalking: 23 minutes.
   - Time woke up early: 5 minutes.
   - Total time subtracted = 23 + 5 = 28 minutes.

5. **Total sleep time on the bed:**
   - Total sleep time without interruptions: 480 minutes.
   - Total time subtracted: 28 minutes.
   - Total sleep time on the bed = 480 - 28 = 452 minutes.

"First, let's determine the number of measuring spoons Jonathan originally has. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has two dozen (24) measuring cups, we calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

Number of measuring spoons = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \)

Next, we account for the 6 measuring spoons that Jonathan gifts to Pedro:

Remaining measuring spoons = 16 - 6 = 10

Now, we calculate the total number of utensils remaining by adding the remaining measuring spoons to the number of measuring cups:

Total utensils remaining = 24 (measuring cups) + 10 (remaining measuring spoons) = 34

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Occupancy Calculation:**
   - The hospital has a total capacity of 1000 beds.
   - 1/5 of the beds are occupied.
   - Number of occupied beds = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.

2. **Initial Unoccupied Beds:**
   - Total beds = 1000
   - Occupied beds = 200
   - Unoccupied beds = 1000 - 200 = 800 beds.

3. **Admissions Over 2 Weeks:**
   - 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - 2 weeks = 14 days.
   - Total patients admitted in 2 weeks = 50 patients/day × 14 days = 700 patients.

4. **Final Occupancy Calculation:**
   - Initial occupied beds = 200
   - Additional occupied beds due to admissions = 700
   - Total occupied beds after 2 weeks = 200 + 700 = 900 beds.

5. **Final Unoccupied Beds:**
   - Total beds = 1000
   - Occupied beds after 2 weeks = 900
   - Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks = 1000 - 900 = 100 beds.

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100.

"To determine how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total emails sent per day**: 16
2. **Work emails**: 7

First, we calculate the number of non-work emails:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we determine how many of these 9 emails are sent to family. Two-thirds of the non-work emails are to family:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

Now, we find out how many emails are left after accounting for the family emails:
\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

Finally, one-third of these remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Thus, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

2. Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya. Therefore, Shawna's age is:
   \[
   3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old}
   \]
3. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Therefore, Shawna's father's age is:

"If Kelly is right and Courtney overstated the number of people by 20%, we can set up the equation to find the actual number of people who attended the concert. Let \( x \) be the actual number of people. According to the problem, Courtney's reported number (48) is 20% more than the actual number. This can be expressed as:

\[ 48 = x + 0.2x \]
\[ 48 = 1.2x \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 1.2:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40.

"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the total number of holes on the island by the end of the fourth day.
3. Use the information that the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes dug by the end of the first day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes, but they filled in 2 holes, so the net holes dug on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

Total holes by the end of the third day:
\[ 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \]

Next, we know that by the end of the fourth day, the total number of holes is four times the number of holes dug by the end of the first day. The number of holes dug by the end of the first day is 10. Therefore, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of holes dug on the fourth day. The total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is the sum of the holes dug by the end of the third day and the holes dug on the fourth day:
\[ 29 + x = 40 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 40 - 29 = 11 \]

Thus, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:
\[ 11 \]

"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( X + S + A = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, substitute \( X \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (S + 5) + S + A = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A = 334 \]

Next, substitute \( S \) from the third equation into the equation \( 2S + A = 334 \):
\[ 2(4A - 13) + A = 334 \]
\[ 8A - 26 + A = 334 \]
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, substitute \( A = 40 \) back into the third equation to find \( S \):
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

Finally, substitute \( S = 147 \) into the second equation to find \( X \):
\[ X = 147 + 5 \]
\[ X = 152 \]

To verify, we check the total:
\[ X + S + A = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339 \]

Thus, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is:
147"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of episodes and then calculate the total time spent watching all episodes.

1. Each episode is 20 minutes long.
2. The number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, the number of episodes is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).

Now, we calculate the total time spent watching all episodes:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Number of episodes} \times \text{Length of each episode} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

"To determine the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction.

1. **First leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Second leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled north: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Third leg of the journey:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance traveled south: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled south:
- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \).
- Total distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \).

Net distance traveled south:
- \( 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \).

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.

"To find out how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of brownies Greta had initially.
2. Subtract the number of brownies eaten during the party.

First, let's convert all quantities to the same unit (individual brownies). There are 12 brownies in a dozen.

- Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies: \(1 \times 12 = 12\) brownies.
- She brought home 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office: \(0.5 \times 12 = 6\) brownies.
- Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies to the surprise party: \(4 \times 12 = 48\) brownies.

Now, let's add these together to find the total number of brownies Greta had initially:
\[ 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \]

Next, we need to account for the brownies eaten during the party. 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten:
\[ 1.5 \times 12 = 18 \]

Subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies:
\[ 66 - 18 = 48 \]

So, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:

"To determine how much Sunny earned over the two days, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold each day and then multiply by the respective prices.

First, let's define the number of boxes sold on each day:
- Let \( G_S \) be the number of gingerbread boxes sold on Saturday.
- Let \( A_S \) be the number of apple pie boxes sold on Saturday.
- Let \( G_U \) be the number of gingerbread boxes sold on Sunday.
- Let \( A_U \) be the number of apple pie boxes sold on Sunday.

From the problem, we know:
- \( G_S = 10 \) (gingerbread boxes sold on Saturday)
- \( A_S = G_S - 4 \) (apple pie boxes sold on Saturday)
- \( G_U = G_S + 5 \) (gingerbread boxes sold on Sunday)
- \( A_U = 15 \) (apple pie boxes sold on Sunday)

Now, let's calculate the number of boxes sold on each day:
- \( A_S = 10 - 4 = 6 \) (apple pie boxes sold on Saturday)
- \( G_U = 10 + 5 = 15 \) (gingerbread boxes sold on Sunday)

Next, we calculate the total number of boxes sold over the two days:
- Total gingerbread boxes: \( G_S + G_U = 10 + 15 = 25 \)
- Total apple pie boxes: \( A_S + A_U = 6 + 15 = 21 \)

Now, we calculate the total earnings:
- Earnings from gingerbread: \( 25 \times 6 = 150 \) dollars
- Earnings from apple pie: \( 21 \times 15 = 315 \) dollars

   - Emil is currently 19 years old.
   - In 5 years, Emil will be 24 years old.

2. **Determine his dad's age when Emil turns 24:**
   - When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
   - Therefore, his dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old.

3. **Determine his dad's current age:**
   - Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his dad will be 48 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, his dad is currently \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.

   \]

Next, we sum the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[
3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds}
\]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we divide the total amount of crawfish by the amount per serving to find the number of servings:
\[
\frac{21}{3} = 7
\]

Thus, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish.

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet:**
   - Each flower is 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot.

2. **Determine the total space each plant, including the space between plants, will occupy:**
   - Each plant needs 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant.
   - Therefore, each plant and the space between it and the next plant will occupy 1 foot (plant) + 1.5 feet (space) = 2.5 feet.

3. **Calculate the total number of plants that can fit in the 111-foot flower bed:**
   - The total number of plants that can fit is the length of the flower bed divided by the space each plant and the space between plants occupy.
   - \( \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4 \)
   - Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

4. **Determine how many more plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 plants.
   - The number of additional plants needed is \( 44 - 17 = 27 \).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   - Each plant costs $6.
   - The total cost is \( 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars per plant} = 162 \text{ dollars} \).

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

1. Calculate the soil used for the sunflowers:
   - Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil.
   - They plant 4 sunflowers.
   - Total soil for sunflowers = 4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds.

2. Calculate the soil used for the carnations:
   - Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil.
   - They plant 10 carnations.
   - Total soil for carnations = 10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds.

3. Calculate the total soil used for sunflowers and carnations:
   - Total soil used = 12 pounds (sunflowers) + 15 pounds (carnations) = 27 pounds.

4. Calculate the remaining soil available for roses:
   - Total soil in the bag = 30 pounds.
   - Remaining soil = 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds.

"To determine the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the process into two parts: peeling and sautéing.

1. **Peeling Time:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, the time required is \( \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Sautéing Time:**
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To sauté 90 shrimp, the time required is \( \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \).

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time is the sum of the peeling time and the sautéing time.
   - Total time = 15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (sautéing) = 45 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the temperature changes step by step.

1. **Cooling on low for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 3 hours, the temperature drops by \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) degrees.

2. **Cooling on high for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   - In 4 hours, the temperature drops by \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) degrees.

3. **Warming up for 2 hours with no air conditioner:**
   - The room warms up by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 2 hours, the temperature increases by \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) degrees.

Now, we sum up the temperature changes:
- Total cooling: \( 6 + 12 = 18 \) degrees.
- Total warming: \( 4 \) degrees.

The net temperature change is:
- \( 18 - 4 = 14 \) degrees.

Thus, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
   - Therefore, the time interval between the two sightings is 75 years.

4. **Determine Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet a second time, and the time interval between the two sightings is 75 years, then Bill was \( 90 - 75 = 15 \) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Thus, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To find Wilfred's age, let's start by using the information given:

1. The total age of the children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old.
3. Alessandro is 4 years old.
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar: 3 years
- Alessandro: 4 years
- Helene: \( H \) years
- Wilfred: \( W \) years

The total age of the children is:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, Wilfred is 3 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

The total watermelon is divided into slices for 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total can be expressed as:
\[ 2(2x) + 4(x) = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

The total watermelon is represented by \( 8x \). Each adult gets \( 2x \) of the watermelon. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final charge of the power bank to determine its initial charge when Maria went to the park.

1. **Final Charge After 3 Hours at 7% Loss:**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( C \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 1 hour, the charge is \( C \times (1 - 0.07) = C \times 0.93 \).
   - After 2 hours, the charge is \( C \times 0.93 \times 0.93 = C \times 0.93^2 \).
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( C \times 0.93^3 \).

   Given that the final charge is 28%, we can set up the equation:
   \[

2. **Charge Before 5 Hours at 9% Loss:**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( D \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 1 hour, the charge is \( D \times (1 - 0.09) = D \times 0.91 \).
   - After 2 hours, the charge is \( D \times 0.91 \times 0.91 = D \times 0.91^2 \).
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( D \times 0.91^3 \).
   - After 4 hours, the charge is \( D \times 0.91^4 \).
   - After 5 hours, the charge is \( D \times 0.91^5 \).

   We know that after 5 hours, the charge is approximately 0.348 (from the previous step):

\[ \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \]

**Step 2: Determine Janet's total earnings per hour.**
Janet earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips.
\[ \text{Total earnings per hour} = 10 + 15 = 25 \]

**Step 3: Calculate Janet's total earnings per week.**
Janet works 40 hours a week.
\[ \text{Total earnings per week} = 25 \times 40 = 1000 \]

**Step 4: Determine how many weeks it will take to save the down payment.**
\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Down payment}}{\text{Total earnings per week}} = \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \]

Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased.

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50 = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50 = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00 = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total spent so far:
$1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount is:
$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:
$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Jim's college education, including the loans and the income he lost by not working, and then determine how long it will take him to earn that amount with his new, higher salary.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the loans:**
   - Jim takes $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.
   - Total loans = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000

2. **Calculate the income lost by not working:**
   - Jim could have earned $25,000 per year if he had not gone to college.
   - Income lost over 4 years = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000

3. **Calculate the total cost of college:**
   - Total cost = Total loans + Income lost
   - Total cost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

4. **Calculate Jim's new income after college:**
   - His college degree tripled his income.
   - New income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

5. **Determine how long it will take to earn the total cost of college:**
   - Annual income after college = $75,000
   - Total cost to be earned = $300,000
   - Time required = Total cost / Annual income

"To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

1. On the first race, he lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. This means he won \(2 \times 5 + 1 = 11\) dollars.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. This means he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- Total lost = First race loss + Third race loss = $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

Since he won $11 in the second race, we need to adjust the total loss by subtracting the win:
- Adjusted total loss = Total lost - Second race win = $21.5 - $11 = $10.5

Finally, to find the average loss per race, we divide the adjusted total loss by the number of races:

- Each day, the team worked \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.

Convert the fraction of a day to hours:
- 1 day = 24 hours
- \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day = \( \frac{3}{8} \times 24 = 9 \) hours

Calculate the total hours worked by the team:
- Total hours = 21 days * 9 hours/day = 189 hours

Finally, divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours worked by each painter:
- Each painter worked \( \frac{189 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ painters}} = 47.25 \) hours

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \). According to the problem:

- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls:

\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:

\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:

\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we know the number of balls retrieved in the second set is 6. To find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

The formula for the price of the car after \( t \) years, given an initial price \( P \) and an annual depreciation rate \( r \), is:
\[ P(t) = P \times (1 - r)^t \]

Here:
- \( P = 20000 \) (initial price of the car)
- \( r = 0.21 \) (annual depreciation rate)
- \( t = 2010 - 2007 = 3 \) years

Substituting the values into the formula:
\[ P(3) = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ P(3) = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ P(3) = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ P(3) \approx 9860.78 \]

The price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately $9860.78.

"To find out how much James pays for insurance a year after his accident, we first need to calculate the new monthly cost and then multiply it by 12.

1. Calculate the increase in the monthly cost due to the accident:
   - The increase is 60% of the normal cost.
   - 60% of $120 = 0.60 * $120 = $72.

2. Add the increase to the normal cost to find the new monthly cost:
   - New monthly cost = $120 + $72 = $192.

3. Calculate the annual cost by multiplying the new monthly cost by 12:
   - Annual cost = $192 * 12 = $2304.

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for insurance.

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to calculate the total amount of food consumed per day and then divide the total amount of food by this daily consumption.

1. Calculate the total amount of food consumed per feeding:
   - Each cat eats 60 grams per feeding.
   - There are 3 cats.
   - Total food per feeding = 60 grams/cat * 3 cats = 180 grams.

2. Calculate the total amount of food consumed per day:
   - The cats are fed twice a day.
   - Total food per day = 180 grams/feeding * 2 feedings/day = 360 grams/day.

3. Determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last:
   - Total food available = 720 grams.
   - Days the food will last = 720 grams / 360 grams/day = 2 days.

"Let's denote the time Donovan spent on his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time spent on the meal is the sum of the times spent by Betsy and Donovan, which is 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, therefore, took:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Thus, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of emails that require a response each day.
2. Multiply the daily number of emails requiring a response by 5 to get the total for the week.

First, we know that 20% of the 80 emails do not require a response. Therefore, 80% of the emails do require a response.

80% of 80 emails = 0.80 * 80 = 64 emails per day

Next, we multiply the number of emails he responds to each day by 5 to find the total for the week:

64 emails/day * 5 days = 320 emails

So, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week.

"To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys each day.

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.

Next, we calculate the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys each day:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week (7 days), the total number of bananas consumed by all three monkeys each day is:
\[ \frac{315 \text{ bananas}}{7 \text{ days}} = 45 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Now, we can find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day by subtracting the number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas consumed each day:
\[ 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas per day} \]

Thus, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs over a period of 4 hours, given that each spring creates a new jellyfish every second.

1. First, calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:
   \[
   4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 14400 \text{ seconds}
   \]

2. Since each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, one spring will create:
   \[
   14400 \text{ jellyfish}
   \]

3. With 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created is:
   \[
   5 \text{ springs} \times 14400 \text{ jellyfish/spring} = 72000 \text{ jellyfish}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is:

"To solve this problem, let's break down James's journey into segments and calculate the time for each.

1. James walks halfway to the store. Since the store is 4 miles away, halfway is 2 miles.
2. He then walks back home, which is another 2 miles.
3. Finally, he walks the full distance to the store, which is 4 miles.

The total distance James walks is:
2 miles (to halfway) + 2 miles (back home) + 4 miles (to the store) = 8 miles

James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find the total time, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the total time is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the total cost of the bananas both ways and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought:
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Each bunch averages 4 bananas.
- Total number of bananas = 10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch = 40 bananas.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:
- Cost per banana = $0.80.
- Total cost for 40 bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Cost per bunch = $3.00.
- Total cost for 10 bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00.

Finally, let's find the amount of money Jenny saved:
- Savings = Cost of buying individually - Cost of buying in bunches
- Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the total weight of the triceratops in kilograms.
2. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so it left \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms of meat.
3. The pack of velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms of meat.
4. After the velociraptors, the remaining meat is \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
5. The group of Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, which is the remaining \( \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.

So, we have:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides by 4:
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

Therefore, the total weight of the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was 1080 kilograms.

"To determine the cost to paint the room, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

1. Calculate the area of the north and south walls:
   - Each wall is 10 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet.
   - Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls = 2 * 80 square feet = 160 square feet.

2. Calculate the area of the east and west walls:
   - Each wall is 5 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet.
   - Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls = 2 * 40 square feet = 80 square feet.

3. Calculate the total area of all four walls:
   - Total area = 160 square feet (north and south) + 80 square feet (east and west) = 240 square feet.

4. Determine the number of gallons of paint needed:
   - One gallon of paint covers 20 square feet.

1. Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy takes off.
3. Calculate the number of days Billy works.
4. Calculate the total number of people he helps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.

Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy takes off.**

Billy takes 20% of the days off.

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times the distance Amber ran, we calculate Micah's distance as follows:

Micah's distance = 3.5 * Amber's distance
Micah's distance = 3.5 * 8 miles
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Next, we add the distances run by Amber and Micah to find the total distance they both ran:

Total distance run by Amber and Micah = Amber's distance + Micah's distance
Total distance run by Amber and Micah = 8 miles + 28 miles
Total distance run by Amber and Micah = 36 miles

Since the total distance run by all three is 52 miles, we can find Ahito's distance by subtracting the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the overall total:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - Total distance run by Amber and Micah

"First, let's determine how many kilograms of apples Pierre and Paul will take.

Pierre wants a quarter of the 12 kg of apples:
\[ \text{Pierre's share} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Paul wants a third of the 12 kg of apples:
\[ \text{Paul's share} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount of apples taken by Pierre and Paul:
\[ \text{Total taken by Pierre and Paul} = 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

The total amount of apples is 12 kg, so the amount left for Jacques is:
\[ \text{Apples left for Jacques} = 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg} \]

"To find out how much money Raymond has left, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial amount of money Raymond had: $21.
2. Add the amount he saved from his allowance: $11.
3. Subtract the amount he spent on the comic book: $5.
4. Subtract the amount he spent on the puzzle: $19.

Let's calculate it step by step:

Initial amount: $21
After saving: $21 + $11 = $32

"To find out how much each book cost, we can start by determining how much money Anna spent today. She started with a budget of $16 and has $2 left, so she spent:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Out of this $14, she had already spent $4 before buying the books today. Therefore, the amount she spent on the books today is:

\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Since she bought 2 books and both cost the same amount, the cost of each book is:

\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, each book cost $5.

"To solve this problem, we first determine the rate at which the lighthouse blinks. The lighthouse blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. We can find the number of blinks per minute by dividing the total number of blinks by the total number of minutes:

\[ \text{Blinks per minute} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for the lighthouse to blink 459 times. We can do this by dividing the total number of blinks we want by the rate of blinks per minute:

\[ \text{Time (in minutes)} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take 9 minutes for the lighthouse to blink 459 times.

"To find out how many more female fish than male fish Tate has, we first need to calculate the total number of male and female fish after the purchase.

Initially, Tate has:
- Male guppies: 4
- Female guppies: 7
- Male goldfish: 3
- Female goldfish: 5

After buying more fish, the new counts are:
- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Male goldfish: 3 + 2 = 5
- Female goldfish: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, we sum the totals for males and females:
- Total male fish: 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfish) = 11
- Total female fish: 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfish) = 16

The difference between the number of female and male fish is:
16 (female) - 11 (male) = 5

"To find the total time Amalia, Megan, and Dior took to do their chores, we need to calculate the time each person spent on their respective tasks and then sum these times.

1. **Amalia's Time:**
   - Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

2. **Megan's Time:**
   - Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog.
   - Therefore, Megan's time = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours.

3. **Dior's Time:**
   - Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia to do the laundry.
   - Therefore, Dior's time = 4 hours + 4 hours = 8 hours.

Now, we sum the times:
- Total time = Amalia's time + Megan's time + Dior's time
- Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours + 8 hours = 18 hours

"To determine how many miles John drives each month when visiting his parents, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the one-way distance John drives to visit his parents.
2. Determine the total distance for a round trip.
3. Calculate the total distance driven in a month, considering he visits his parents twice a month.

Step 1: Calculate the one-way distance.
- John drives for 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- One-way distance = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles

Step 2: Determine the total distance for a round trip.
- Round trip distance = One-way distance × 2
- Round trip distance = 140 miles × 2 = 280 miles

Step 3: Calculate the total distance driven in a month.
- John visits his parents twice a month.
- Total monthly distance = Round trip distance × 2
- Total monthly distance = 280 miles × 2 = 560 miles

Therefore, the total number of miles John drives each month when visiting his parents is 560 miles.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, calculate the total distance Sofie will walk in 7 days:
   - Sofie walks 10 miles every day.
   - In 7 days, she will walk \( 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \).

2. According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian:
   - Let \( B \) be the distance Brian walks in 7 days.
   - We know that \( 70 \text{ miles} = 2 \times B \).

3. Solve for \( B \):
   - \( B = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \).

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in one 10-hour shift.
2. Determine the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in one 10-hour shift.
3. Use the information that 20 toys are still needed to find out how many toys the fifth worker produced in the 10-hour shift.
4. Calculate the hourly production rate of the fifth worker.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in one 10-hour shift:

- 2 workers produce 6 toys per hour each:
  \[
  2 \times 6 \times 10 = 120 \text{ toys}
  \]
- 2 workers produce 4 toys per hour each:
  \[
  2 \times 4 \times 10 = 80 \text{ toys}
  \]

Adding these together gives the total production by the first 4 workers:
\[
120 + 80 = 200 \text{ toys}
\]

Next, we know that the manufacturer still needs 20 toys to complete the order of 400 toys. Therefore, the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in the 10-hour shift is:
\[
400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys}
\]

Since the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[
380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys}
\]

Finally, to find the hourly production rate of the fifth worker, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours in the shift:
\[
\frac{180}{10} = 18 \text{ toys per hour}
\]

Thus, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.

"To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs, we first need to determine the weights of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory’s dog.

Kory’s dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah’s first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah’s second dog is half the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weights of all three dogs:
\[ \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( S \) be the number of stickers Seth had initially.
2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
3. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
4. Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris. The remaining stickers are \( \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4} \).
5. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. Therefore, Kris had \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers.
6. Since Kris had \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers, we set up the equation: \( \frac{S}{4} = 16 \).

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = 16 \times 4 \]
\[ S = 64 \]

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

"First, we need to calculate the total number of M&M's John has. Each large bag weighs 10 ounces, and there are 3 large bags, so the total weight is:

\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per bag} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 30 M&M's per ounce, the total number of M&M's is:

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&M's per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&M's} \]

John puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, so the number of small bags he can make is:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&M's}}{10 \text{ M&M's per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

"To determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate half of the earth's circumference.
2. Divide this distance by the distance Alfie flies each day.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the daily distance:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

2. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.
   - Speed of the 2nd fastest car = 5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour.
3. The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.
   - Speed of the fastest car = 1.25 * 600 = 750 miles per hour.

Therefore, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. 

1. Liam is currently 16 years old.
2. Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.
3. At that time, Liam’s age was twice Vince’s age. Let's denote Vince’s age two years ago as \( V \). Therefore, we have the equation:
   \[
   14 = 2V
   \]
4. Solving for \( V \):
   \[
   V = \frac{14}{2} = 7
   \]
5. This means Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:
   \[
   7 + 2 = 9

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total eggs painted by all four**: 56 eggs.
2. **Eggs painted by Camden and Sarah**: 30 eggs.
3. **Eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline**: 56 - 30 = 26 eggs.
4. **Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs**: Let \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted. Therefore, Madeline also painted \( A \) eggs.
5. **Total eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline**: \( A + A = 2A = 26 \).
6. **Solving for \( A \)**: \( 2A = 26 \) → \( A = 13 \).

So, Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs.

7. **Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs**: Let \( C \) be the number of eggs Camden painted and \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.
8. **Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah**: \( C = S + 12 \).
9. **Total eggs painted by Camden and Sarah**: \( C + S = 30 \).

Substitute \( C = S + 12 \) into the equation \( C + S = 30 \):

\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs.

10. **Number of eggs Camden painted**: \( C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \).

Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:

\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of groups of 8 crayons Nik can make with 200 crayons.
2. Calculate the total number of boxes needed.
3. Calculate the total weight of the crayons.
4. Calculate the total weight of the boxes.
5. Add the total weight of the crayons and the boxes.
6. Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds.

Step 1: Determine the number of groups of 8 crayons.
\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total number of boxes needed.
Since each group of 8 crayons goes into one box, the number of boxes is equal to the number of groups.
\[ \text{Number of boxes} = 25 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total weight of the crayons.
\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Step 4: Calculate the total weight of the boxes.
\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Step 5: Add the total weight of the crayons and the boxes.
\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Step 6: Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds.
\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

"First, we need to determine how much of the tree can be used for logs. Since John can use 80% of the 80-foot tree, we calculate:

\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs can be cut from the 64 feet of usable tree:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

From each 4-foot log, John cuts 5 planks. Therefore, the total number of planks is:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Each plank is sold for $1.2, so the total revenue from selling the planks is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time Grandma spends walking, given the different speeds on the beach and the sidewalk.

First, let's find Grandma's speed on the beach. Since she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, her speed on the beach is:
\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

Next, we need to find her speed on the sidewalk. According to the problem, she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we calculate the time it takes for her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:
\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:

"To determine how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we first need to calculate how much she has already saved. Jane saves $4 every week, and she has been saving for 8 weeks. Therefore, the amount she has saved so far is:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60. This can be calculated by subtracting the amount she has already saved from the total amount she wants to save:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jane saves $4 each week, we can determine the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining $28 by dividing the remaining amount by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many marbles Bob currently has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen equals 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Current number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Solving for the current number of marbles:

\[ \text{Current number of marbles} = 60 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Current number of marbles} = 36 \]

Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, we need to subtract 10 from his current number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a temperature of at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T_1 \) as the temperature of the water in the first mug (33 degrees).
- \( T_2 \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug (unknown).
- \( T_f \) as the final temperature of the mixed water.

Donny pours 4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. The total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces.

The formula for the final temperature \( T_f \) when mixing two different temperatures is given by:

\[
T_f = \frac{(m_1 \cdot T_1) + (m_2 \cdot T_2)}{m_1 + m_2}
\]

where:
- \( m_1 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the first mug (4 ounces).
- \( m_2 \) is the mass (or volume) of water from the second mug (1 ounce).

Substituting the known values:

\[
T_f = \frac{(4 \cdot 33) + (1 \cdot T_2)}{4 + 1}
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
T_f = \frac{132 + T_2}{5}
\]

We know that \( T_f \) must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[
132 + T_2 \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides:

\[
T_2 \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is 68 degrees.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate:**
   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops.
   - \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops.

2. **Determine the number of potatoes needed to make a certain number of scoops:**
   - It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops.
   - \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes.
   - \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops.

   So, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. **Calculate the number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   - We know that 3 potatoes make 2 scoops.
   - To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we set up a proportion:
     \[
     \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}}
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{3 \text{ potatoes} \times 18 \text{ scoops}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \text{ potatoes}

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first calculate the total number of eggs he consumes.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of eggs consumed over 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs to dozens:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84. This means the total parts of the ratio (5 + 9) is 14 parts.

Each part of the ratio represents:
\[ \frac{84}{14} = 6 \text{ passengers} \]

So, the number of men on the bus is:
\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \]

And the number of women on the bus is:
\[ 9 \times 6 = 54 \]

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[ 54 - 20 = 34 \]

Thus, the number of women who have remained on the bus is:

"To find out how much money John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
2. Calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.
3. Calculate the total number of collections John makes in a week.
4. Calculate the total amount of money John makes in a week.

Step 1: Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
- The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have \(200 + 200 = 400\) apartments.
- The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two, so it has \(400 \times 0.60 = 240\) more apartments.
- Therefore, the third complex has \(400 + 240 = 640\) apartments.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.
- The total number of apartments is \(200 + 200 + 640 = 1040\).

Step 3: Calculate the total number of collections John makes in a week.

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \), the length of the red rope as \( R \), and the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( R = 4B \) (The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope)
2. \( B = Y - 7 \) (The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope)
3. \( R + B + Y = 37 \) (The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters)

First, substitute \( B \) from the second equation into the first and third equations:
\[ R = 4(Y - 7) \]
\[ R + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]

Simplify the second equation:
\[ R + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \]
\[ R + 2Y - 7 = 37 \]
\[ R + 2Y = 44 \]

Now substitute \( R = 4(Y - 7) \) into \( R + 2Y = 44 \):
\[ 4(Y - 7) + 2Y = 44 \]
\[ 4Y - 28 + 2Y = 44 \]
\[ 6Y - 28 = 44 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now, find \( B \) using \( B = Y - 7 \):
\[ B = 12 - 7 \]
\[ B = 5 \]

Finally, find \( R \) using \( R = 4B \):
\[ R = 4 \times 5 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Amount Given to Their Little Sister:**
   - Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
   - After giving \(x\) dollars, Rissa is left with \(15 - x\) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The mural is divided into four colors: red, white, purple, and yellow.
2. Half of the mural is yellow, so the remaining half is divided equally among red, white, and purple.
3. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

First, let's determine how much of the mural is yellow:
- Half of the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint used is:

  \]

Since the remaining half is divided equally among red, white, and purple, each of these colors uses:
\[
\frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ pints}
\]

Therefore, the amount of red paint used is:
\[
2 \text{ pints}

The cost per pod in the special size box is:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Therefore, for $1, you can buy:
\[ \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}} = 10 \text{ pods} \]

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run:
\[ 10 \text{ cycles} \]

"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of $20 bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing 10 Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 of these $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining $20 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining $20 bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas triples the value of the remaining $20 bills.
   \[
   \text{Value of remaining $20 bills} = 20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tripled value} = 400 \times 3 = 1200
   \]

5. **Converting to $5 Bills:**
   Thomas converts the $1200 into $5 bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of $5 bills} = \frac{1200}{5} = 240
   \]

Thus, the final number of $5 bills Thomas has is:
\[
240

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. In the first half:
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. In the second half:
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. Total goals scored by each team:
   - Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\) goals.
   - Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\) goals.

4. Total number of goals scored in the match:
   - \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\) goals.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk is left after Monday and then calculate how many days the teacher can use the remaining chalk before it is less than 2 inches.

1. **Initial Chalk Length**: 5 inches
2. **Chalk Used on Monday**: 45% of 5 inches
   \[
   0.45 \times 5 = 2.25 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. **Chalk Remaining After Monday**: 
   \[
   5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches}
   \]

Next, we need to determine how many days the teacher can use 20% of the remaining chalk each day before the chalk is less than 2 inches.

4. **Chalk Used Each Day**: 20% of the remaining chalk
5. **Chalk Remaining Each Day**: 80% of the previous day's remaining chalk

We will calculate the remaining chalk day by day until it is less than 2 inches.

- **Day 1 (Tuesday)**:
  \[
  2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \text{ inches}
  \]
- **Day 2 (Wednesday)**:
  \[
  2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \text{ inches}
  \]

On Wednesday, the chalk is 1.76 inches, which is less than 2 inches. Therefore, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk on Wednesday.

The teacher has 2 days before he has to recycle the piece of chalk.

"To find out how many students are not on varsity, we first need to calculate the number of students who are on varsity.

There are 12 girls in the class, and one-third of them are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity} \]

There are 12 boys in the class, and one-fourth of them are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity} \]

So, the total number of students on varsity is:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \]

The total number of students in the class is:

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we first need to determine the total number of teeth the dentist works on. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Therefore, the number of teeth capped is:

4 (drilled) + 7 = 11 (capped)

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped:

4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 (total fixed)

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5C + 35}{3} \]
Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]
Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]
Divide by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy:
   - Cost of 100 books = $500
   - Total money Bob has = $27000
   - Number of 100-book sets Bob can buy = $27000 / $500 = 54 sets
   - Total number of books = 54 sets * 100 books/set = 5400 books

2. Since the books are distributed equally among 3 schools:

"Let's break down the sequence of events to determine how many apples Newton brought home:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up both apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other one into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall.
3. Now, there are 1 (from the first throw) + 5 (newly fallen) = 6 apples on the ground.
4. Newton picked up these 6 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree, causing another 6 apples to fall.
5. Now, there are 1 (from the second throw) + 6 (newly fallen) = 7 apples on the ground.
6. Newton picked up all 7 apples and went home.

Now, let's count the total number of apples Newton has in his pocket:
- From the first pick-up: 1 apple
- From the second pick-up: 5 apples
- From the third pick-up: 6 apples

Total apples in Newton's pocket: 1 + 5 + 6 = 12

Therefore, Newton brought home 12 apples.

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of slices consumed by her 6 friends.

Each friend eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

For 6 friends, the total number of slices consumed is:
- Cheese pizza slices: \(6 \times 6 = 36\) slices
- Pepperoni pizza slices: \(6 \times 4 = 24\) slices

Next, we calculate the number of whole pizzas needed for each type:
- Each cheese pizza has 12 slices. Therefore, the number of cheese pizzas needed is:
  \[
  \frac{36}{12} = 3 \text{ cheese pizzas}
  \]
- Each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices. Therefore, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is:

"To solve this problem, we need to consider both the rate at which Jay makes snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of making snowballs**: Jay makes 20 snowballs per hour.
2. **Rate of melting snowballs**: 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs melt per hour.

Therefore, the net rate of snowball accumulation per hour is:
\[ 20 \text{ (made)} - 8 \text{ (melted)} = 12 \text{ snowballs per hour} \]

We need to find out how long it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. Using the net rate of 12 snowballs per hour, we can set up the equation:
\[ 12 \text{ snowballs/hour} \times t \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ snowballs} \]

Solving for \( t \):
\[ t = \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Determine the year Digimon came out. Since it had its 20th anniversary, we can calculate the year it came out by subtracting 20 from the current year. Assuming the current year is 2023:
   \[
   2023 - 20 = 2003
   \]
   So, Digimon came out in 2003.

2. Determine John's age when Digimon came out. John is 28 years old now, so in 2003, he was:
   \[
   28 - (2023 - 2003) = 28 - 20 = 8
   \]
   John was 8 years old when Digimon came out.

3. According to the problem, when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. Therefore, Jim's age in 2003 was:
   \[
   \frac{8}{2} = 4
   \]
   Jim was 4 years old when Digimon came out.

4. Calculate Jim's current age. Since 20 years have passed since 2003, Jim's current age is:

"To solve this problem, let's break down the usage and orders of bandages over the three days and work backwards to find out how many bandages they started with.

1. **First Day:**
   - Used 38 bandages.
   - Ordered 1 bulk pack (50 bandages).

2. **Second Day:**
   - Used 10 fewer bandages than the first day: \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - Ordered 2 bulk packs (2 * 50 = 100 bandages).
   - Used half a pack: \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
   - Had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

Let's calculate the total number of bandages used and ordered over the three days:

- **Total bandages used:**
  - First day: 38
  - Second day: 28
  - Third day: 25
  - Total used: \(38 + 28 + 25 = 91\) bandages.

- **Total bandages ordered:**
  - First day: 50
  - Third day: 100
  - Total ordered: \(50 + 100 = 150\) bandages.

Now, let's determine the initial number of bandages:
- Let \( x \) be the number of bandages they started with on the first day.
- After the first day, they had \( x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 \) bandages.
- After the second day, they had \( x + 12 - 28 = x - 16 \) bandages.
- After the third day, they had \( x - 16 + 100 - 25 = x + 59 \) bandages.

We know that at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left:
\[ x + 59 = 78 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 78 - 59 \]
\[ x = 19 \]

Therefore, they started with 19 bandages on the first day.

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information about the average distance walked by the dogs. The average distance is the total distance walked by all dogs divided by the number of dogs.

Given:
- The first dog walks 1 mile.
- The second dog walks 4 miles.
- The third dog walks 3 miles.
- The average distance walked by the 4 dogs is 3 miles per day.

First, calculate the total distance walked by all 4 dogs:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Average distance} \times \text{Number of dogs} = 3 \, \text{miles/day} \times 4 = 12 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, calculate the total distance walked by the first three dogs:
\[ \text{Total distance for first three dogs} = 1 \, \text{mile} + 4 \, \text{miles} + 3 \, \text{miles} = 8 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, find the distance walked by the last dog:
\[ \text{Distance for the last dog} = \text{Total distance} - \text{Total distance for first three dogs} = 12 \, \text{miles} - 8 \, \text{miles} = 4 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water removed by the dehumidifier at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian runs it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting: \( 1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters} \).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, so it removes \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) liters per day.
   - Brian runs it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting: \( 2 \text{ liters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ liters} \).

3. **High Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting, so it removes \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) liters per day.
   - Brian runs it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on high setting: \( 4 \text{ liters/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ liters} \).

Now, we sum the total water removed at each setting:
\[ 3 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} + 20 \text{ liters} = 29 \text{ liters} \]

"To determine how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Stephen owes after adding the 2% interest.
2. Calculate the total amount Stephen will have paid over the first 11 months.
3. Subtract the amount paid over the first 11 months from the total amount owed to find the remaining amount to be paid in the twelfth month.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount Stephen owes after adding the 2% interest.**

The principal amount is $300. The interest is 2% of $300.

\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen owes is:

\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total amount Stephen will have paid over the first 11 months.**

Stephen pays $25 per month for 11 months.

\[ \text{Total paid in 11 months} = 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

**Step 3: Subtract the amount paid over the first 11 months from the total amount owed to find the remaining amount to be paid in the twelfth month.**

\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month.

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the jar.
2. Determine the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans.
3. Calculate the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar.
4. Estimate the number of red jelly beans based on Tim's guess.
5. Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.**

The jar is a rectangular prism with a square base:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \, \text{inches} \times 6 \, \text{inches} \times 15 \, \text{inches} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans.**

The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume is:
\[ \text{Effective volume} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches} \times 0.80 = 432 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar.**

Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches:
\[ \text{Total number of jelly beans} = \frac{432 \, \text{cubic inches}}{0.15 \, \text{cubic inches/jelly bean}} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans} \]

**Step 4: Estimate the number of red jelly beans based on Tim's guess.**

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red:
\[ \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans} \times 0.30 = 864 \, \text{red jelly beans} \]

**Step 5: Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.**

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between Tim's estimate and the true number is:
\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

Therefore, Tim's guess was off by 36 red jelly beans.

"To determine how much Pauline spent on all her visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost of visits before the price increase and the cost of visits after the price increase.

1. **Calculate the cost of visits before the price increase:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - The cost of one visit is $2.
   - She visits the museum for 5 years.
   - Total cost for 5 years = 3 visits/year * $2/visit * 5 years = $30.

2. **Calculate the new cost of one visit after the price increase:**
   - The cost of one visit increased by 150%.
   - 150% of $2 = 1.5 * $2 = $3.
   - New cost of one visit = $2 + $3 = $5.

3. **Calculate the cost of visits after the price increase:**
   - Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year for 3 more years.
   - Total cost for 3 years = 3 visits/year * $5/visit * 3 years = $45.

4. **Calculate the total cost for all visits:**

"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is:
\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( c \) represent the number of cupcakes Carly makes.
Let \( b \) represent the number of brownies Carly makes.

From the problem, we know:
1. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes:
   \[
   b = 3c - 2
   \]

2. Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats:
   \[
   \text{Total treats} = 5 \times 2 = 10
   \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and brownies:
\[
c + b = 10
\]

Now, substitute the expression for \( b \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
c + (3c - 2) = 10
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
4c - 2 = 10
\]

Add 2 to both sides:
\[
4c = 12
\]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[
c = 3

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought. She bought five dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40.

Total cost = 5 dozens * $2.40/dozen
Total cost = $12.00

Next, we need to determine how many eggs Rose has in total. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs:

Total eggs = 5 dozens * 12 eggs/dozen
Total eggs = 60 eggs

Now, let's calculate how much Rose will earn from selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at a rate of $1 for 3 eggs.

Total earnings = (Total eggs / 3 eggs) * $1
Total earnings = (60 eggs / 3 eggs) * $1
Total earnings = 20 * $1
Total earnings = $20.00

Finally, to find Rose's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings:

Profit = Total earnings - Total cost
Profit = $20.00 - $12.00

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which can be written as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S = 120 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is 96.

"To find out how much Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels during her trip, we need to calculate the costs separately and then add them together.

1. **Hotel Cost:**
   - Helen stayed for 3 nights.
   - The cost of one night at the hotel is $80.
   - Total hotel cost = 3 nights * $80/night = $240.

2. **Bus Cost:**
   - Helen rode the bus 7 times.
   - The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the price of one night at the hotel.
   - Cost of one bus trip = 10% of $80 = 0.10 * $80 = $8.
   - Total bus cost = 7 trips * $8/trip = $56.

"To determine how many screws James will have left over, we first need to calculate the total number of screws required for the 4 tables.

1. Each table has 4 legs.
2. Each leg needs 2 screws.
3. Therefore, each table requires \(4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws}\).

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws in total. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the number of screws used from the total number of screws:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Therefore, the number of screws James will have left over is:

"To find the total amount of money raised by the girls, we need to calculate the individual amounts each girl raised and then sum them up.

1. Alexandra raises $430.
2. Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.
3. Sarah raises $300.
4. Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we sum the amounts raised by each girl:
- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: $750
- Sarah: $300
- Maryam: $700

Total amount raised = $430 + $750 + $300 + $700 = $2180

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the distance Aaron ran:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles, and she ran twice as far as Aaron.
   - Therefore, Aaron ran \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.

2. **Determine Aaron's speed:**
   - Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.
   - Therefore, Aaron's speed is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \).

3. **Determine Vanessa's speed:**
   - Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
   - Therefore, Vanessa's speed is \( 2 \times 8 \text{ minutes per mile} = 16 \text{ minutes per mile} \).

4. **Calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:**
   - Vanessa's speed is 16 minutes per mile.
   - Therefore, the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles is \( 4 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 64 \text{ minutes} \).

Thus, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To determine how much new line the caretaker needs to buy, we first calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock. Since he needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, the total required line is:

\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line/foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

The caretaker already has 6 feet of new line. Therefore, the additional line he needs to buy is:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

"To determine how much Tom's restaurant makes a week from reservations, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost per reservation:**
   - Each reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine.
   - Cost of meals per reservation: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars.
   - Cost of wine per reservation: \(5\) dollars.
   - Total cost per reservation: \(10 + 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total revenue per night:**
   - The restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.
   - Revenue per night: \(6 \times 15 = 90\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total revenue per week:**
   - The restaurant is open 2 days a week.
   - Revenue per week: \(90 \times 2 = 180\) dollars.

Thus, the total revenue Tom's restaurant makes a week is:

"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we first need to calculate the total selling price of all the watermelons, and then divide that by the number of watermelons.

1. Calculate the total cost price of the watermelons:
   - The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80.

2. Calculate the total profit:
   - The profit is 25% of the cost price.
   - Profit = 25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20.

3. Calculate the total selling price:
   - Total selling price = Cost price + Profit = $80 + $20 = $100.

4. Calculate the selling price per watermelon:
   - Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons = $100 / 50 = $2.

Thus, each watermelon was sold for $2.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Dora's current age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.
   - Therefore, Dora is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

2. **Determine James's current age:**
   - James is twice as old as Dora.
   - Therefore, James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

3. **Determine John's current age:**
   - John had James when he was 19.
   - Since James is 18 years old, John is currently \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

4. **Determine the age of John's youngest son:**
   - John's youngest son was born when John was 32.
   - Since John is currently 37 years old, his youngest son is \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

5. **Determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years:**
   - In 3 years, John's youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in one hour and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- The number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

Next, let's calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- The number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original price is $400, and he gets it for 80% off, which means he pays 20% of the original price.

Cost of the radiator after discount = $400 * 20% = $400 * 0.20 = $80

Next, we calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

Cost of labor = $50 * 3 = $150

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of labor to find the total amount Mark paid.

Total cost = Cost of the radiator + Cost of labor = $80 + $150 = $230

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

1. The total number of animals is 20:
   \[
   C + K = 20
   \]

2. The total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each:
   \[
   2C + 4K = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
   \[
   C + 2K = 35
   \]

Now we have the system of equations:
   \[
   C + K = 20
   \]
   \[
   C + 2K = 35
   \]

Subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( C \):
   \[
   (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20
   \]
   \[
   K = 15
   \]

Now substitute \( K = 15 \) back into the first equation:
   \[
   C + 15 = 20
   \]
   \[
   C = 5
   \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.

"To determine how many slices each person can have, we first need to calculate the total number of pizza slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people sharing the pizzas. Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

So, each person can have 14 slices.
