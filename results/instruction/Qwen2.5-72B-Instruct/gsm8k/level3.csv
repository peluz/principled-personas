"To determine the total number of bolts needed for the robe, we first need to calculate the amount of white fiber required. The problem states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber, the amount of white fiber needed is:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1 \text{ bolt} \]

Next, we add the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together to find the total number of bolts:

\[ 2 \text{ bolts (blue)} + 1 \text{ bolt (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts} \]

Therefore, the total number of bolts needed for the robe is:

"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the house including the purchase price and the repairs.
2. Determine the new value of the house after the repairs.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the house.**
- Purchase price: $80,000
- Repairs: $50,000
- Total cost: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

**Step 2: Determine the new value of the house after the repairs.**
- The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%.
- 150% of the original value ($80,000) is calculated as: 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000
- Therefore, the new value of the house is: $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

**Step 3: Calculate the profit.**
- New value of the house: $200,000
- Total cost: $130,000
- Profit: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

"To find out how many total meters James runs a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. First, determine how many meters James runs in one session. Since he runs 3 sprints and each sprint is 60 meters, we multiply the number of sprints by the distance of each sprint:
   \[ 3 \text{ sprints} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters/session} \]

2. Next, since James runs 3 times a week, we multiply the distance he runs in one session by the number of sessions per week:
   \[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

Therefore, the total distance James runs in a week is 540 meters.

"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken needs per day:
   Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day.

2. Calculate the total amount of feed needed for all the chickens per day:
   Since Wendi has 20 chickens, the total feed needed is:
   \( 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \)

3. Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:
   In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed.
   In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups of feed.
   The total feed given by the afternoon is:
   \( 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \)

4. Calculate the amount of feed needed for the final meal:
   The total feed needed for the day is 60 cups, and 40 cups have already been given. Therefore, the feed needed for the final meal is:
   \( 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \)

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To calculate the total cost for Kylar's purchase, we need to consider the discount applied to every second glass. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. The cost of the first glass is $5.
2. The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is $5 * 0.60 = $3.
3. This pattern repeats for every pair of glasses.

Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, we can divide the total number of glasses by 2 to find the number of pairs:
16 / 2 = 8 pairs

For each pair, the cost is:
$5 (first glass) + $3 (second glass) = $8

Now, multiply the cost of one pair by the total number of pairs:
8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

"To determine the total time it takes for Carla to download the 200 GB file, we need to account for the initial download progress, the interruption, and the restart.

1. **Initial Download Progress:**
   - Carla downloads at a rate of 2 GB/minute.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 200 \times 0.40 = 80 \) GB.
   - Time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Interruption and Restart:**
   - The Windows update forces a restart, which takes 20 minutes.
   - After the restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning.

3. **Complete Download After Restart:**
   - The entire file is 200 GB.
   - Time to download 200 GB is \( \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \).

4. **Total Time:**
   - Initial download time: 40 minutes.
   - Restart time: 20 minutes.
   - Complete download time after restart: 100 minutes.
   - Total time: \( 40 + 20 + 100 = 160 \) minutes.

"To determine how far John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled and then subtract the distance he covered on his way back.

1. **Distance traveled initially:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Distance traveled on the way back:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles.
   - For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - For the remaining 1.5 hours (since 4 hours total - 2 hours in traffic - 0.5 hours at 30 mph = 1.5 hours), he drives at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total distance traveled on the way back:**
   - Total distance = 0 miles (traffic) + 15 miles (30 mph) + 120 miles (80 mph) = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from home:**
   - Initial distance from home = 180 miles.
   - Distance covered on the way back = 135 miles.
   - Distance from home at the end = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to consider both her regular pay and her overtime pay.

1. **Regular Pay Calculation:**
   - Regular hours worked: 40 hours
   - Regular rate: $10 per hour
   - Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

2. **Overtime Pay Calculation:**
   - Overtime hours worked: 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours
   - Overtime rate: 1.2 times the regular rate = 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour
   - Overtime pay = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay
   - Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on his lemon tree, we need to calculate the break-even point. This is the point where the total revenue from selling lemons equals the total cost of planting and maintaining the tree.

Let's define the variables:
- \( C \) = initial cost to plant the tree = $90
- \( R \) = annual revenue from selling lemons = 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.5/year
- \( M \) = annual maintenance cost = $3/year

The net annual profit \( P \) is the annual revenue minus the annual maintenance cost:
\[ P = R - M = 10.5 - 3 = 7.5 \text{ dollars/year} \]

The break-even point occurs when the total net profit equals the initial cost:
\[ \text{Total Net Profit} = P \times \text{Number of Years} \]
\[ \text{Total Net Profit} = 7.5 \times \text{Number of Years} \]

Setting the total net profit equal to the initial cost:
\[ 7.5 \times \text{Number of Years} = 90 \]

Solving for the number of years:
\[ \text{Number of Years} = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12 \]

Therefore, it will take Carlos 12 years to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

1. Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left after selling half of what was left at the orange house. This means that before selling at the orange house, she had \(5 \times 2 = 10\) vacuum cleaners.
2. Before selling to the red house, she had 2 more vacuum cleaners than what she had before selling at the orange house. So, before selling to the red house, she had \(10 + 2 = 12\) vacuum cleaners.
3. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. This means that the 12 vacuum cleaners she had before selling to the red house represent the remaining two-thirds of her original stock. Therefore, the original number of vacuum cleaners is \(12 \div (2/3) = 12 \times (3/2) = 18\).

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to break down her earnings from both jobs and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She teaches for 35 hours a week.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- Therefore, her weekly earnings from teaching are \(35 \text{ hours/week} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$700/\text{week}\).

Next, let's calculate her earnings from cheerleading coaching:
- She coaches for 15 hours a week.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- Therefore, her weekly earnings from coaching are \(15 \text{ hours/week} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$450/\text{week}\).

Now, let's find her total weekly earnings:
- Total weekly earnings = Earnings from teaching + Earnings from coaching
- Total weekly earnings = \$700 + \$450 = \$1150

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual salary is:
- Annual salary = Total weekly earnings \(\times\) Number of weeks
- Annual salary = \$1150 \(\times\) 50 = \$57,500

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we first need to calculate the total time she should take to complete the 12-mile trail.

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given:
- Total Distance = 12 miles
- Desired Average Speed = 4 miles per hour

We can rearrange the formula to solve for Total Time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 2 hours hiking the first 6 miles. Therefore, the remaining time she has to complete the trail is:
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = \text{Total Time} - \text{Time Already Spent} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance she needs to cover is:
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the required speed for the remaining distance:
\[ \text{Required Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

"First, let's determine the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in it is:
\[ 10 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \]

Since 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, the remaining amount of orange drink is 9 liters. The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:
\[ 9 \times \frac{2}{3} = 6 \text{ liters} \]

Next, let's determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in it is:
\[ 15 \times \frac{3}{5} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the water from the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink:
\[ 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture is:
\[ 15 \text{ liters} \]

"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to subtract the distance of his first stop from the total trip distance and then subtract the distance from his second stop to the end of the trip. 

The total trip distance is 60 miles. He made his first stop after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end, which means he had 15 miles left to travel after his second stop.

First, we calculate the distance from the start to the second stop:
60 miles (total trip) - 15 miles (to the end from the second stop) = 45 miles (to the second stop from the start).

Next, we find the distance between the first and second stops:
45 miles (to the second stop) - 20 miles (to the first stop) = 25 miles.

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

"To solve this problem, we first need to set up the equations based on the given ratio and the total age.

Let \( D \) represent Darrell's age and \( A \) represent Allen's age. According to the problem, the ratio of their ages is 7:11, which can be written as:
\[ \frac{D}{A} = \frac{7}{11} \]

This can be rewritten as:
\[ D = \frac{7}{11}A \]

We are also given that the sum of their ages is 162:
\[ D + A = 162 \]

Substituting \( D = \frac{7}{11}A \) into the equation \( D + A = 162 \):
\[ \frac{7}{11}A + A = 162 \]

To combine the terms, we need a common denominator:
\[ \frac{7A + 11A}{11} = 162 \]
\[ \frac{18A}{11} = 162 \]

Next, solve for \( A \):
\[ 18A = 162 \times 11 \]
\[ 18A = 1782 \]
\[ A = \frac{1782}{18} \]
\[ A = 99 \]

So, Allen's current age is 99. To find Allen's age 10 years from now:
\[ 99 + 10 = 109 \]

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now is:

"To find the average guess, we first need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the average.

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we add these guesses together and divide by the number of guesses to find the average:
\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]
\[ \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

The average guess is 80.

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following system of equations based on this information:
\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, determine how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of Raymond's jewels is:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   Therefore, Aaron has:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25 \text{ jewels}
   \]

2. Next, determine how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, Siobhan has:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23 \text{ jewels}
   \]

Thus, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

"To find out how many total points Mike scored, we first need to calculate the points he scored in the second 20 minutes. He scored 25% more points in the second 20 minutes compared to the first 20 minutes.

First, we calculate 25% of the points scored in the first 20 minutes:
25% of 4 points = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored:
4 points + 1 point = 5 points

Now, we add the points from both periods to get the total points:
4 points (first 20 minutes) + 5 points (second 20 minutes) = 9 points

"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine the cost per yogurt.
3. Calculate the total cost for the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.

Step 1: Total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats:
2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts

Step 2: Cost per yogurt
The yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00, so the cost per yogurt is:
$5.00 / 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt

Step 3: Total cost for 60 yogurts
The total cost for 60 yogurts is:
60 yogurts * $1.25/yogurt = $75.00

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine Dana's walking and running speeds based on the given information.

1. **Determine Dana's skipping speed and its relation to her running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping speed is half as fast as running speed.
   - Therefore, running speed = 2 * skipping speed = 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running speed is four times walking speed.
   - Therefore, walking speed = running speed / 4 = 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time = 6 hours.
   - Time spent running = one-third of total time = 6 / 3 = 2 hours.
   - Time spent walking = two-thirds of total time = 2 * (6 / 3) = 4 hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running and walking:**
   - Distance running = running speed * time running = 6 * 2 = 12 miles.
   - Distance walking = walking speed * time walking = 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles.

5. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = distance running + distance walking = 12 + 6 = 18 miles.

Thus, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 18 miles.

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories in the bag of chips.
2. Determine the number of calories per gram.
3. Calculate the remaining calories you can consume.
4. Convert the remaining calories into grams of chips.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of calories in the bag of chips.**
- The bag has 5 servings.
- Each serving has 250 calories.
- Total calories in the bag = 5 servings * 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories.

**Step 2: Determine the number of calories per gram.**
- The bag weighs 300 grams.
- Total calories in the bag = 1250 calories.
- Calories per gram = 1250 calories / 300 grams = 4.17 calories/gram.

**Step 3: Calculate the remaining calories you can consume.**
- Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
- You have already consumed 1800 calories.
- Remaining calories = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

**Step 4: Convert the remaining calories into grams of chips.**
- Calories per gram = 4.17 calories/gram.
- Remaining calories = 200 calories.
- Grams of chips you can eat = 200 calories / 4.17 calories/gram ≈ 47.96 grams.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a linear equation based on the information given.

1. Candice initially had 80 post-it notes.
2. She then purchased a package of post-it notes, which we'll call \( x \).
3. At work, she used 220 post-it notes.
4. She had 23 post-it notes remaining.

We can set up the equation as follows:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of post-it notes in the package that she purchased is 163.

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he buys is:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. Therefore, the cost of each red tie is:

Cost per red tie = Cost per blue tie + 50% of cost per blue tie
Cost per red tie = $40 + 0.5 * $40
Cost per red tie = $40 + $20
Cost per red tie = $60

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
Total spent on red ties = 10 * $60
Total spent on red ties = $600

Finally, the total amount spent on all ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

Total spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
Total spent on ties = $200 + $600
Total spent on ties = $800

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level. Given that each level has half the square footage of the level below it, and the top level (4th level) has a square footage of 16, we can work our way down to the bottom level.

1. The 4th level has a square footage of 16.
2. The 3rd level, being twice the 4th level, has a square footage of \(16 \times 2 = 32\).
3. The 2nd level, being twice the 3rd level, has a square footage of \(32 \times 2 = 64\).
4. The 1st level, being twice the 2nd level, has a square footage of \(64 \times 2 = 128\).

Now, we sum the square footages of all levels:
\[ 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = 240 \]

To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[ \frac{240}{4} = 60 \]

"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first 180 days and the remaining days of the year.

1. **First 180 days:**
   - The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food per day.
   - Total cups of food for 180 days: \( 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \).

2. **Remaining days of the year:**
   - A year has 365 days.
   - Remaining days after the first 180 days: \( 365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days} \).
   - The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food per day.
   - Total cups of food for the remaining 185 days: \( 185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups} \).

3. **Total cups of food for the first year:**
   - Total cups for the first 180 days: 180 cups.
   - Total cups for the remaining 185 days: 370 cups.
   - Total cups for the year: \( 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \).

4. **Number of bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 110 cups of dog food.
   - Number of bags required: \( \frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags} \).

Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year.

"First, let's determine how much laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Sarah's laundry} = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \]

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry:

\[ 400 = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \]

Solving for David's laundry:

\[ \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah:

\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Sarah's laundry} \]

\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} \]

\[ \text{Difference} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, determine how much water each girl received. Since each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water:
   \[
   \text{Water each girl received} = \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters}
   \]

2. Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they received together is:
   \[
   \text{Total water for two girls} = 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters}
   \]

3. The boy received 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy is:
   \[
   \text{Total water taken} = 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters}
   \]

4. Finally, subtract the total amount of water taken from the initial 24 liters to find out how much water is left:
   \[
   \text{Water left} = 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters}

"Let's set up a system of equations to solve this problem. Let \( W \) represent the number of games won and \( L \) represent the number of games lost.

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can translate these into the following equations:
1. \( W + L = 22 \)
2. \( W = L + 8 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know \( L = 7 \), we can find \( W \) using the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the compounded salary increases over these years.

1. **Initial Monthly Salary**: $600
2. **Initial Annual Salary**: $600 * 12 = $7,200

Since Sylvie has just completed 5 years, she will receive a 10% increase on her initial annual salary.

3. **First Year Increase (Year 6)**:
   - New Annual Salary = $7,200 + (10% of $7,200) = $7,200 + $720 = $7,920

4. **Second Year Increase (Year 7)**:
   - New Annual Salary = $7,920 + (10% of $7,920) = $7,920 + $792 = $8,712

5. **Third Year Increase (Year 8)**:
   - New Annual Salary = $8,712 + (10% of $8,712) = $8,712 + $871.20 = $9,583.20

Thus, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be:

"To determine how many pounds of potato salad Ted needs to bring, we can break down the problem into two parts: the amount of potato salad needed for the adults and the amount needed for the children.

1. **Calculate the amount of potato salad for the adults:**
   - Each adult will eat 10 lbs of potato salad.
   - There are 20 adults.
   - Total potato salad for adults = 10 lbs/adult * 20 adults = 200 lbs.

2. **Calculate the amount of potato salad for the children:**
   - Each child will eat half as much as an adult, so each child will eat 10 lbs / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad.
   - There are 5 children.
   - Total potato salad for children = 5 lbs/child * 5 children = 25 lbs.

3. **Calculate the total amount of potato salad needed:**
   - Total potato salad = potato salad for adults + potato salad for children
   - Total potato salad = 200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

"To solve this problem, let's set up the relationships with equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( J \) represent Jackson's age.
2. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Amy's age is \( J + 5 \).
3. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Corey's age is \( (J + 5) + 2 = J + 7 \).
4. James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey's age is \( 10 + 1 = 11 \).

Now we know Corey's age is 11, so we can set up the equation for Corey's age:
\[ J + 7 = 11 \]

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 11 - 7 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

So, Jackson is 4 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of dogs and cats:**
   - The number of dogs is given as 60.
   - Since there are two cats for every dog, the number of cats is \(2 \times 60 = 120\).

2. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   - The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats.
   - The combined number of dogs and cats is \(60 + 120 = 180\).
   - Therefore, the number of rabbits is \(180 - 12 = 168\).

3. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   - The total number of pets is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.

Next, we find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. To find the number of girls in the girl scout:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce.
   - Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the initial volume of tomatoes must have been twice the volume of the sauce.
   - Initial volume of tomatoes = 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.

2. **Determine the number of cans of tomatoes used:**
   - Each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes.
   - Number of cans used = Initial volume of tomatoes / Volume per can = 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.

3. **Determine the number of tomatoes used:**
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.
   - Total number of tomatoes used = Number of cans * Tomatoes per can = 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

Thus, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. Let's break down the information given:

1. Originally, there were 30 cars on the motorway.
2. Some cars drove through in the first 15 minutes.
3. 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.
4. 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the 20 cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes:
\[ x + 20 \]

The total number of cars that did not drive through the traffic jam is 5 (those that took an exit).

Since the original number of cars was 30, the equation representing the total number of cars is:
\[ x + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x + 25 = 30 \]
\[ x = 30 - 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can set up an equation based on the total time he spent watching TV throughout the week.

First, let's summarize the time spent watching TV each day:
- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: \( x \) 30-minute episodes
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours (30 minutes)
- Friday: 2 hours

The total time spent watching TV is 7 hours. We can express this as:
\[ 1 + 1 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 1 + 1 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7 \]
\[ 5.5 + 0.5x = 7 \]
\[ 0.5x = 7 - 5.5 \]
\[ 0.5x = 1.5 \]
\[ x = \frac{1.5}{0.5} \]
\[ x = 3 \]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, Henry intended to bake twice as many cookies as last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies.

However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he intended, so he baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, leaving him with 110 cookies. Therefore, before dropping the cookies, he had \( 110 + 5 = 115 \) cookies.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2x + 15 = 115 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 2x + 15 = 115 \]
\[ 2x = 115 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 100 \]
\[ x = \frac{100}{2} \]
\[ x = 50 \]

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate on average, we first need to calculate the total area of the fruit roll-ups each of them had.

For Beatrice:
- The area of her fruit roll-up is calculated by multiplying the width by the length.
- Width = 2 roll-ups, Length = 24 roll-ups.
- Area = 2 * 24 = 48 roll-ups.

For Marcell:
- The area of his fruit roll-up is also calculated by multiplying the width by the length.
- Width = 3 roll-ups, Length = 14 roll-ups.
- Area = 3 * 14 = 42 roll-ups.

Next, we find the total amount of fruit roll-ups eaten by both:
- Total = 48 (Beatrice) + 42 (Marcell) = 90 roll-ups.

To find the average amount of fruit roll-ups eaten:
- Average = Total amount / Number of people
- Average = 90 / 2 = 45 roll-ups.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of water that entered the boat while Julia was rowing back to shore. We can break this down into a few steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance Julia rowed:**
   - Julia took 16 seconds to row 20 feet.
   - The shore was 64 seconds away.
   - The total distance rowed is calculated by:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = \left(\frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}}\right) \times 20 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Determine the rate at which water entered the boat:**
   - The boat took on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed.
   - The rate of water intake is:
     \[
     \text{Rate of water intake} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 0.2 \text{ liters per foot}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of water that entered the boat:**
   - Using the total distance rowed and the rate of water intake:
     \[
     \text{Total water intake} = 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.2 \text{ liters per foot} = 16 \text{ liters}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of water that the boat took on by the time Julia reached shore is:

2. Let \( B \) be the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.
3. Let \( D \) be the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

From the problem, we know:
- Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone: \( J = 6B \).
- The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph: \( B = 50D \).
- Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs: \( J = 1800 \).

First, substitute \( J = 1800 \) into the equation \( J = 6B \):
\[ 1800 = 6B \]
\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} \]
\[ B = 300 \]

Next, substitute \( B = 300 \) into the equation \( B = 50D \):
\[ 300 = 50D \]
\[ D = \frac{300}{50} \]
\[ D = 6 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many teaspoons of sugar Katy used, given the total amount of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water and the ratio of 7:13.

First, let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as \( S \) and the number of cups of water as \( W \). According to the problem, the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13, which can be written as:
\[ \frac{S}{W} = \frac{7}{13} \]

We also know that the total amount of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water used is 120. Therefore, we can write:
\[ S + W = 120 \]

From the ratio, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( W \):
\[ S = \frac{7}{13}W \]

Now, substitute \( S \) in the total equation:
\[ \frac{7}{13}W + W = 120 \]

Combine the terms on the left side:
\[ \frac{7W + 13W}{13} = 120 \]
\[ \frac{20W}{13} = 120 \]

To solve for \( W \), multiply both sides by 13:
\[ 20W = 1560 \]

Divide both sides by 20:
\[ W = 78 \]

Now that we have \( W \), we can find \( S \) using the ratio:
\[ S = \frac{7}{13} \times 78 \]
\[ S = 7 \times 6 \]
\[ S = 42 \]

Therefore, the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of vehicles that were already at the port from the first day. According to the information, there were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles from the first day is:

2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30 vehicles. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles:

30 vehicles (total) - 10 vehicles (first day) = 20 vehicles (added on the second day)

Since each container holds 5 vehicles, we can determine the number of containers added on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:

20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

Thus, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4.

"First, let's determine Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary} = \text{Lylah's salary} + 0.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]

Given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, we can solve for Lylah's salary:

\[ 40000 = \text{Lylah's salary} + 0.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]
\[ 40000 = 1.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = 30769.23 \]

Next, we calculate Adrien's salary four years later. His salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago:

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 56000 \]

Assuming Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's (40%), we calculate her new salary:

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 12307.69 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 43076.92 \]

Finally, we add both their new salaries to find the total salary they were receiving four years later:

\[ \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary} = 99076.92 \]

- Delivery fee: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

Now, add the delivery fee and the tip to the total cost of items:
- Total cost including delivery fee and tip: $20.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

Therefore, the final cost of Rory's delivery order is:
$29.00"
"To determine how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the number of questions he completed in the given time for each test and then find the difference between the total number of questions and the completed ones.

**First Test:**
- Total questions: 75
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 8 hours

Number of questions completed in the first test:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ questions} \]

Number of questions left incomplete in the first test:
\[ 75 \text{ questions} - 40 \text{ questions} = 35 \text{ questions} \]

**Second Test:**
- Total questions: 100
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 6 hours

Number of questions completed in the second test:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ questions} \]

Number of questions left incomplete in the second test:
\[ 100 \text{ questions} - 30 \text{ questions} = 70 \text{ questions} \]

**Total questions left incomplete:**

"Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as \( B \) and the number of pink gumballs as \( P \). According to the problem, there are 12 blue gumballs, so \( B = 12 \).

The problem also states that the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs. This can be expressed as:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

Substituting \( B = 12 \) into the equation:
\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of pink gumballs is 70.

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. 

The number of semi-automatic cars is:
20 (total cars) - 12 (automatic cars) - 4 (manual cars) = 4 semi-automatic cars.

To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:
( Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars ) * 100

So, the percentage is:
( 4 / 20 ) * 100 = 20%

"To solve this problem, let's set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( W \) represent the number of worker bees.
2. Let \( B \) represent the number of baby bees.
3. Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
- The total number of bees is 700: \( W + B + Q = 700 \)
- There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \)
- There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \)

We can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation to solve for the variables.

First, substitute \( B = 2Q \) into \( W = 2B \):
\[ W = 2(2Q) = 4Q \]

Now, substitute \( W = 4Q \) and \( B = 2Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, substitute \( Q = 100 \) back into the equations for \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200 \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400 \]

Therefore, the number of worker bees is:

"To determine how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Jordan spends playing video games in one week.
2. Determine how much he would earn if he worked those hours instead.

First, Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, Jordan earns $10 per hour at his part-time job. Therefore, if he worked the 14 hours he usually spends playing video games, he would earn:
\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 140 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, Jordan would earn $140 in one week if he spent his video game time working instead.

"To calculate the total cost, we first need to identify which items are food and which are nonfood, and then apply the 10% tax to the nonfood items.

Food items (no tax):
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3

Nonfood items (10% tax):
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

First, calculate the total cost of food items:
$2 (milk) + $3 (eggs) = $5

Next, calculate the total cost of nonfood items before tax:
$3 (light bulbs) + $3 (cups) + $4 (roach traps) = $10

Now, calculate the tax on the nonfood items:
10% of $10 = $1

Add the tax to the cost of the nonfood items:
$10 + $1 = $11

Finally, add the total cost of food items and the total cost of nonfood items (including tax):
$5 (food) + $11 (nonfood with tax) = $16

The total cost is $16.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Bees leaving in the first 6 hours:**
   - Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Bees returning in the next 6 hours:**
   - She sees 1/2 that many bees return.
   - \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) bees return.

3. **Bees leaving in the next 6 hours:**
   - She sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive.
   - \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees leave.

4. **Bees returning in the last 6 hours:**
   - Every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive.
   - Bees that left initially: 30
   - Bees that returned: 15
   - Bees that left again: 60
   - Bees that had not returned: \( 30 + 60 - 15 = 75 \) bees

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, so Charlie has \( 3D \) friends.
- James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, so James has \( 4D \) friends.
- We are given that Charlie has 12 friends, so \( 3D = 12 \).

First, solve for \( D \):
\[ 3D = 12 \]
\[ D = \frac{12}{3} \]
\[ D = 4 \]

Now, we know Dorothy has 4 friends. To find out how many friends James has, we use the relationship \( 4D \):
\[ 4D = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends.

"To determine how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: 3 miles = 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles = 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Steve's time: 
  \[
  \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet per minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}
  \]
- Tim's time: 
  \[
  \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet per minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in their times:
\[
\text{Difference} = 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}
\]

The winner will be waiting for 4 minutes before the loser finishes the race.

"To find out how much Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total cost for inflating the tires of the bicycles, tricycles, and the unicycle.

1. Bicycles have 2 tires each. Since 5 people came by with bicycles and each tire costs 25 cents to inflate:
   - Total tires for bicycles = 5 bicycles * 2 tires/bicycle = 10 tires
   - Cost for bicycles = 10 tires * 25 cents/tire = 250 cents

2. Tricycles have 3 tires each. Since 3 people came by with tricycles:
   - Total tires for tricycles = 3 tricycles * 3 tires/tricycle = 9 tires
   - Cost for tricycles = 9 tires * 25 cents/tire = 225 cents

3. A unicycle has 1 tire. Since 1 person came by with a unicycle:
   - Total tires for the unicycle = 1 tire
   - Cost for the unicycle = 1 tire * 25 cents/tire = 25 cents

Adding these amounts together gives the total earnings:
- Total earnings = 250 cents + 225 cents + 25 cents = 500 cents

Since 100 cents make a dollar, we convert the total earnings to dollars:
- Total earnings in dollars = 500 cents / 100 = 5 dollars

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final number of fries left to the initial number of fries in the pack. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Final number of fries left:** 5 fries.
2. **Ants carried off 1 fry:** Before the ants, there were \(5 + 1 = 6\) fries.
3. **Raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries:** Let \(x\) be the number of fries before the raccoon took them. The raccoon took \(\frac{2}{3}x\), leaving \(\frac{1}{3}x\). So, \(\frac{1}{3}x = 6\). Solving for \(x\), we get \(x = 6 \times 3 = 18\).
4. **Three pigeons each ate 3 fries:** Before the pigeons, there were \(18 + 3 \times 3 = 18 + 9 = 27\) fries.
5. **Seagull ate half the amount Dave ate:** Dave ate 14 fries, so the seagull ate \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) fries. Before the seagull, there were \(27 + 7 = 34\) fries.
6. **Dave ate 14 fries:** Before Dave, there were \(34 + 14 = 48\) fries.

Thus, the initial number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was 48.

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable to this scenario of repeated percentage increases.

The formula for the future value (FV) is:
\[ FV = P \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial price of the marbles),
- \( r \) is the rate of increase per period,
- \( n \) is the number of periods.

Given:
- \( P = 20 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.20 \) (20% increase),
- The price increases every 2 months, so in 36 months, there are \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) periods.

Substituting the values into the formula:
\[ FV = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18} \]
\[ FV = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Calculating \( (1.20)^{18} \):
\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 38.3376 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:
\[ FV = 20 \times 38.3376 \]
\[ FV \approx 766.752 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent:
\[ FV \approx 766.75 \]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months would be:

"Let's denote Seth's current age as \( S \) and Brooke's current age as \( B \). According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, which gives us the equation:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \) and Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \). The problem states that the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, which gives us the equation:
\[ (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( S = 2B \)
2. \( S + B = 24 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using the first equation:

"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs for each type of creature and then sum them up.

1. For the spiders: 80 spiders * 8 legs each = 640 legs
2. For the insects: 90 insects * 6 legs each = 540 legs
3. For the rare mutant invertebrates: 3 invertebrates * 10 legs each = 30 legs

Now, we add all the legs together:
640 legs (spiders) + 540 legs (insects) + 30 legs (invertebrates) = 1210 legs

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and set up the equations accordingly:

1. Let \( S_2 \) represent Sally Two's age.
2. Let \( G_R \) represent Granny Red's age.
3. Let \( S_4 \) represent Sally Four's age.
4. Let \( S_{32} \) represent Sally Thirtytwo's age.

From the problem, we know:
- Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
  \[
  S_4 = S_{32} = 8
  \]
- Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four.
  \[
  G_R = 2 \times S_4 = 2 \times 8 = 16
  \]
- Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.
  \[
  S_2 = G_R + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19

"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum on all her debts, we first need to calculate the total minimum monthly payment and then find 50% more than that amount. Finally, we will multiply by 12 to get the annual payment.

1. Calculate the total minimum monthly payment:
   - Student loans: $300
   - Credit card: $200
   - Mortgage: $500
   Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

2. Calculate 50% more than the total minimum monthly payment:
   50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500
   Total monthly payment with 50% more = $1000 + $500 = $1500

3. Calculate the annual payment:
   Annual payment = $1500 * 12 = $18000

"To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( g \) be the number of gallons of lemonade they made.
- The cost for lemons per gallon is $3, so the total cost for lemons is \( 3g \).
- The cost for sugar per gallon is $2, so the total cost for sugar is \( 2g \).
- The total cost for making the lemonade is \( 3g + 2g = 5g \).

Next, we calculate the revenue:
- They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so the revenue per gallon is \( 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \) dollars.
- The total revenue for \( g \) gallons is \( 10g \).

The profit is given as $25, so we can set up the profit equation:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ 25 = 10g - 5g \]
\[ 25 = 5g \]

Solving for \( g \):
\[ g = \frac{25}{5} \]
\[ g = 5 \]

Now, we need to find out how much they spent on lemons:
\[ \text{Cost for lemons} = 3g \]
\[ \text{Cost for lemons} = 3 \times 5 \]
\[ \text{Cost for lemons} = 15 \]

So, they spent $15 on lemons.

3. Determine the remaining amount after rent and car fuel expenses.
4. Calculate the amount donated to charity.
5. Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount.
6. Determine the final amount Zaid has left.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. **Rent:**
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car Fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Car Fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Remaining Amount after Rent and Car Fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Donation to Charity:**
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Remaining Amount after Donation:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining after Donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Subtract Amounts Given to Daughter and Wife:**
   \[
   \text{Final Remaining} = 1250 - 200 - 700 = 350 \text{ dollars}

"To find the number of votes the loser got, we first need to determine the number of votes the winner received. The winner got 3/4 of the total votes. 

Total votes = 80
Votes for the winner = 3/4 * 80 = 60

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes for the winner and the loser. Therefore, the votes for the loser can be calculated by subtracting the votes for the winner from the total votes.

Votes for the loser = Total votes - Votes for the winner
Votes for the loser = 80 - 60 = 20

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( C \) represent the number of white carnations.
2. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4C \).
3. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. Therefore, \( 200 = 5C \).

First, solve for \( C \) using the equation for the pink calla lilies:
\[ 200 = 5C \]
\[ C = \frac{200}{5} \]
\[ C = 40 \]

Now, use the value of \( C \) to find the number of red roses:
\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4C \]

1. Jean is two years older than Mark:
   \[
   J = M + 2
   \]

2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age:
   \[
   M - 2 = 5 + \frac{1}{2}(30 - 2)

First, simplify the second equation:
\[
M - 2 = 5 + \frac{1}{2}(28)
\]
\[
M - 2 = 5 + 14
\]
\[
M - 2 = 19

"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time each team takes to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay.

**Team A (Well-Rounded Team):**
Each runner runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time for Team A = 4 runners * 55 seconds/runner = 220 seconds.

**Team B (Less Well-Rounded Team):**
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Total time for Team B = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

**Difference in Time:**

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then determine how much more likely one event is compared to the other.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   - The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - The probability is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).
   - Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is \( 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \).

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5.
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25.
   - To find how much more likely the first event is compared to the second, we calculate the ratio of the probabilities and then convert it to a percentage:
     \[
     \text{Ratio} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
     \]
   - This means the first event is 2 times more likely than the second event.
   - To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
     \[
     2 \times 100 = 200\%
     \]

Thus, it is 200% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( r \) as the number of rats in each cage.
- There are 3 cages of rats, so the total number of rats is \( 3r \).
- Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the total straw for the rats is \( 3r \times 6 = 18r \).

For the hamsters:
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
- Since each cage has one hamster, the total straw for the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \) pieces.

For the rabbits:
- The total straw for the rabbits is 20 pieces.

The total straw distributed is 160 pieces. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 18r + 50 + 20 = 160 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 18r + 70 = 160 \]

Subtract 70 from both sides:

\[ 18r = 90 \]

Divide both sides by 18:

\[ r = 5 \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is 5.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of bags of wheat the trader bought and sold.

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The cost to buy the bags is \( 20x \) dollars.
   - The cost to transport the bags is \( 2x \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \( 20x + 2x = 22x \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - The selling price per bag is $30.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling \( x \) bags is \( 30x \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is given by the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - The profit is \( 30x - 22x = 8x \) dollars.

5. **Set up the equation for the profit:**
   - We know the trader made a total profit of $400.
   - Therefore, \( 8x = 400 \).

6. **Solve for \( x \):**

"To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate his earnings from both publishers. 

First, we know that Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher. Since he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits:
\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for each publisher} \]

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, his earnings from Publisher A are:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]

Thus, his earnings from Publisher B are:
\[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the earnings from both publishers gives:

"To determine the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the lowest score among the first five tests: 71.
2. Calculate the sum of the remaining four scores: 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367.
3. Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test.
4. The sum of the five highest scores (after removing the lowest score) will be \( 367 + x \).
5. To achieve an average of 93, the sum of these five scores divided by 5 should equal 93:
   \[
   \frac{367 + x}{5} = 93
   \]
6. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   367 + x = 93 \times 5
   \]
   \[
   367 + x = 465
   \]
   \[
   x = 465 - 367
   \]
   \[
   x = 98
   \]

Brinley needs to score 98 on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score.

"To find out how many kilometers Michael rode in total, we can break the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

For the first four weeks:
- Michael rides his bike 5 times a week.
- Each ride is 25 kilometers.
- Total kilometers per week = 5 rides/week * 25 kilometers/ride = 125 kilometers/week.
- Total kilometers for four weeks = 125 kilometers/week * 4 weeks = 500 kilometers.

For the next three weeks:
- Michael rides his bike 2 times a week.
- Each ride is 60 kilometers.
- Total kilometers per week = 2 rides/week * 60 kilometers/ride = 120 kilometers/week.
- Total kilometers for three weeks = 120 kilometers/week * 3 weeks = 360 kilometers.

Adding the kilometers from both periods:
- Total kilometers = 500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

1. **Weight of the chocolate bars:**
   - Each chocolate bar weighs 40g.
   - Joe has 25 chocolate bars.
   - Total weight of chocolate bars = 25 bars * 40g/bar = 1000g.

2. **Weight of the candied apples:**
   - Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.
   - Therefore, each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g.
   - Joe has 80 candied apples.
   - Total weight of candied apples = 80 apples * 20g/apple = 1600g.

3. **Total weight of the bag:**
   - Total weight = weight of chocolate bars + weight of candied apples
   - Total weight = 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

"To find out how many cakes Rose bought in total, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and then add them together.

On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. So, the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday is:
3 * 4 = 12 cakes

On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, the number of cakes she bought on Wednesday is:
5 * 12 = 60 cakes

Now, we add the number of cakes bought each day to find the total:
4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday) = 76 cakes

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates = 6 plates.
   - Total cost of half a dozen plates = 6 * $6000 = $36000.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - Let the cost of one cup be \( C \).
   - Twenty dozen cups = 20 * 12 = 240 cups.
   - Total cost of twenty dozen cups = 240 * \( C \).

3. **Set up the equation based on the given information:**
   - The total cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Therefore, 240 * \( C \) = $36000 - $1200.
   - 240 * \( C \) = $34800.

4. **Solve for \( C \):**
   - \( C \) = $34800 / 240.
   - \( C \) = $145.

The total cost of buying each cup is $145.

"To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the jacket:
\[ 30 + 40 = 70 \]

So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the additional amount she needs is:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so her total earnings from babysitting are:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Adding her babysitting earnings to her initial savings:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Sara still needs:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we set up the equation:
\[ 4 \times \text{number of times} = 40 \]

Solving for the number of times:
\[ \text{number of times} = \frac{40}{4} = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of eggs collected each day is 42.
2. There are two more white chickens than red chickens.

We can set up the following system of equations based on this information:

1. \( 3r + 5w = 42 \) (total eggs equation)
2. \( w = r + 2 \) (relationship between the number of chickens)

First, substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( r \):

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify and solve for \( r \):

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, which is a rectangle. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know the perimeter of the park is 15 miles. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find the time \(T\) it takes for him to walk the perimeter, we use the formula:

\[ T = \frac{Distance}{Speed} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]

"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the first day: 100 customers.
2. Calculate the number of customers on the second day: 100 customers + 50 customers = 150 customers.
3. Add the number of customers from the first two days: 100 customers + 150 customers = 250 customers.
4. Subtract the total number of customers from the first two days from the total number of customers over the three days to find the number of customers on the third day: 500 customers - 250 customers = 250 customers.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let \( B(t) \) be the amount of water in the big pool at time \( t \) (in minutes), and \( S(t) \) be the amount of water in the small pool at time \( t \).

Given:
- Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons/minute.
- 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
- Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

First, we express the water levels 4 minutes ago:
\[ B(t-4) = B(t) + 4 \times 4 = B(t) + 16 \]
\[ S(t-4) = S(t) + 4 \times 4 = S(t) + 16 \]

According to the problem:
\[ B(t-4) = 2S(t-4) \]
Substituting the expressions for \( B(t-4) \) and \( S(t-4) \):
\[ B(t) + 16 = 2(S(t) + 16) \]
\[ B(t) + 16 = 2S(t) + 32 \]
\[ B(t) = 2S(t) + 16 \]

Now, we use the information that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now:
\[ B(t) = 4S(t) \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B(t) = 2S(t) + 16 \)
2. \( B(t) = 4S(t) \)

Setting these two equations equal to each other:
\[ 2S(t) + 16 = 4S(t) \]
\[ 16 = 2S(t) \]
\[ S(t) = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase. The cost of the shoes is $320.00 and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00, given that she earns $8.00 per hour. We do this by dividing the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ 352.00 \div 8.00 = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours to make her purchase.

"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth needs to pay back. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% interest.

The interest amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be paid back is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount paid from the total amount due:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we first need to determine the number of dahlias. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses and there are 4 roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, to find the total number of flowers in the vase, we add the number of roses and the number of dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

   \]
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
   \]

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
1. Harriet's age in three years:
   \[
   21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years}
   \]
2. Adrian's age in three years:
   \[
   63 + 3 = 66 \text{ years}

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we first need to determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna based on the information given.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \). Therefore, Yuri scored \( 34 + 10 = 44 \) points.
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna scored \( 68 + 17 = 85 \) points.

Next, we calculate the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[ 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the total points scored by the other three students from the overall total:
\[ 251 - 197 = 54 \]

Thus, Jojo scored 54 points.

"First, we determine how much water is left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters. The initial amount of water in the tank is 120 liters.

120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters

This means there are 30 liters of water left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters. 

Next, Celine collects rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. Since 30 liters were left, the amount of rainwater collected is:

2 * 30 liters = 60 liters

Now, we add the rainwater collected to the remaining water in the tank:

30 liters + 60 liters = 90 liters

Therefore, the total amount of water in the tank now is 90 liters.

"First, let's determine how many pen pals Mike still has:
- Mike originally had 5 pen pals.
- He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them.
- Therefore, he now has 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals.

Next, let's calculate the total number of letters Mike receives each week:
- Each of his 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week.
- Therefore, he receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters a week.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week.

Now, let's determine the total number of pages Mike writes each week:
- Each letter is 5 pages long.
- Therefore, for 6 letters, he writes 6 * 5 = 30 pages a week.

Next, we calculate the total time Mike spends writing each week:
- Mike can write a page every 6 minutes.
- Therefore, for 30 pages, he spends 30 * 6 = 180 minutes writing.

Finally, we convert the total writing time from minutes to hours:
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, 180 minutes is 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

"To determine how many minutes Jason has left in his phone plan, we need to calculate the total minutes he has used and subtract that from his monthly allowance.

1. Calculate the total minutes Jason uses for his daily calls with his boss:
   - He calls his boss for 15 minutes every day.
   - There are 30 days in the month.
   - Total minutes for boss calls = 15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes.

2. Add the extra minutes he has used for calls to other people:
   - Extra minutes = 300 minutes.

3. Calculate the total minutes used:
   - Total minutes used = 450 minutes (boss calls) + 300 minutes (extra calls) = 750 minutes.

4. Subtract the total minutes used from his monthly allowance:
   - Monthly allowance = 1000 minutes.
   - Minutes left = 1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries from Griffin:
   \( 24 - 5 = 19 \) fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle:
   \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) fries.
   \( 19 - 10 = 9 \) fries left.
4. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took:
   \( 5 - 3 = 2 \) fries.
   \( 9 - 2 = 7 \) fries left.
5. Ginger gives Griffin some fries, and Griffin ends up with 27 fries:
   Let \( x \) be the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin.
   \( 7 + x = 27 \).

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 27 - 7 \]
\[ x = 20 \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( f \).

The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is:
\[ 2f \]

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2f \]
\[ 28 = 4f \]

Solving for \( f \):
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ f = 7 \]

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To find the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
3. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight to find the remaining weight.

First, calculate the total weight of the redwood tree:
- The tree is 200 feet tall.
- Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.
- Therefore, the number of 10-foot sections in the tree is \( \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \).
- The total weight of the tree is \( 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \).

Next, calculate the weight of the wood that the termites ate:
- The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood.
- 30% of 8000 pounds is \( 0.30 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 2400 \text{ pounds} \).

Finally, subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the total weight:
- The remaining weight of the tree is \( 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds} \).

The final weight of the redwood tree is 5600 pounds.

- Let \( J_b \) be the number of bananas Jamal has.
- Let \( A_a \) be the number of apples Andrea has.
- Let \( A_b \) be the number of bananas Andrea has.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal: \( A_a = J_a + 8 \)
2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal: \( A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \)
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples: \( J_b = J_a + 4 \)
4. Andrea has 52 apples: \( A_a = 52 \)

First, substitute \( A_a = 52 \) into the first equation:
\[ 52 = J_a + 8 \]
\[ J_a = 52 - 8 \]
\[ J_a = 44 \]

Next, use \( J_a = 44 \) in the third equation to find \( J_b \):
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 48 \]

Now, use \( J_b = 48 \) in the second equation to find \( A_b \):
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \]
\[ A_b = 24 \]

Finally, calculate the total number of fruits:
\[ \text{Total fruits} = A_a + A_b + J_a + J_b \]

   - So, Sean's lines in the first scene are \( \frac{108}{3} = 36 \) lines.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the song.
   - Therefore, the second scene has \( 54 + 6 = 60 \) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, Sean's lines in the second scene are \( \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \) lines.

Now, we add up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
- Lines from the song: 54
- Lines from the first scene: 36
- Lines from the second scene: 48

Total lines Sean has to memorize:
\[ 54 + 36 + 48 = 138 \]

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \). According to the problem, we have two equations based on the information given:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning.
2. Determine how many loaves are left after the morning sales.
3. Calculate how many loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening combined.
4. Since the afternoon and evening sales are equal, divide the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening by 2 to find the afternoon sales.

Step 1: Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning.
- The bakery produces 60 loaves each day.
- Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning.
- Number of loaves sold in the morning = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \) loaves.

- Loaves sold in the morning = 40
- Loaves left = 60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Step 3: Calculate how many loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening combined.
- Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening.
- Number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening combined = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \) loaves.

Step 4: Since the afternoon and evening sales are equal, divide the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening by 2 to find the afternoon sales.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much weight Joey loses in one week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the weight loss per week for Joey is:

\[ \text{Weight loss per week for Joey} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Therefore, Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we set up the proportion:

\[ \text{Weight loss per week for Sandy} = \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for Sandy to lose 8 pounds:

\[ \text{Weeks for Sandy to lose 8 pounds} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 16 \text{ weeks} \]

Thus, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

$6000 (total money) - $2000 (savings) = $4000

Subtracting the expenses from the amount he plans to spend:
$4000 - $1950 = $2050

Therefore, Theo has $2050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Let \( N \) be Noah's current age.
   - Six years ago, Noah's age was \( N - 6 \).

2. **Determine Cera's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera's age was \( 46 - 6 = 40 \).

3. **Set up the relationship between Noah's and Cera's ages six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera.
   - Therefore, \( N - 6 = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).

4. **Solve for Noah's current age:**
   - \( N - 6 = 20 \)
   - \( N = 20 + 6 = 26 \)

5. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Noah's age six years ago was 20.
   - Therefore, the population of Chile six years ago was \( 3000 \times 20 = 60000 \).

6. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half what it is now.
   - Let \( P \) be the current population of Chile.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{P}{2} = 60000 \).
   - \( P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000 \).

The population of Chile now is 120000."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \). According to the problem, the number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the offense has \( 2D \) players. The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the special teams have \( \frac{D}{2} \) players.

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[ 6D + D = 210 \]

\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, solve for \( D \):

\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]

\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited. She invited 2 families with 6 people each and 3 families with 4 people each.

For the 2 families with 6 people each:
2 families * 6 people/family = 12 people

For the 3 families with 4 people each:
3 families * 4 people/family = 12 people

Adding these together gives:
12 people + 12 people = 24 people

Next, we account for the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness. Additionally, 1/4 of that number had previous commitments:
1/4 * 8 = 2 people

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is:
8 people (illness) + 2 people (commitments) = 10 people

Subtracting the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited gives:
24 people - 10 people = 14 people

Therefore, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ice cubes are required to cool the coffee by 65 degrees and then calculate the total amount by which the coffee is weakened.

1. **Determine the number of ice cubes needed:**
   Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. To cool the coffee by 65 degrees:
   \[
   \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weakening effect of the ice cubes:**
   Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. With 5 ice cubes:
   \[
   \text{Weakening from ice cubes} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

3. **Add the weakening effect of the cream:**
   Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee:
   \[
   \text{Total weakening} = 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}

"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. We know that 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record. Let's denote the number of old records brought in by the 5 people as \( x \).

Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, the number of new records received is \( \frac{x}{2} \).

According to the problem, the 5 people leave with 7 new records. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{x}{2} = 7
\]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[
x = 7 \times 2

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of junior and senior programmers and their respective salaries, then calculate the total monthly payroll for all programmers.

1. **Determine the number of junior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees.
   - Number of junior programmers = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \).

2. **Determine the number of senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of senior programmers = Total employees - Number of junior programmers.
   - Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60.

3. **Determine the salary of senior programmers:**
   - Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month.
   - Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers.
   - Salary of senior programmers = $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

4. **Calculate the total monthly payroll for junior programmers:**
   - Total payroll for junior programmers = Number of junior programmers \(\times\) Salary of junior programmers.
   - Total payroll for junior programmers = 40 \(\times\) $2000 = $80,000.

5. **Calculate the total monthly payroll for senior programmers:**
   - Total payroll for senior programmers = Number of senior programmers \(\times\) Salary of senior programmers.
   - Total payroll for senior programmers = 60 \(\times\) $2400 = $144,000.

"To find out how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts with a 40% discount, we first calculate the total cost of the shirts without the discount. Each shirt costs $30, and he bought 2 shirts, so the total cost is:

\[ 30 \times 2 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the discount amount. A 40% discount on $60 is:

\[ 60 \times 0.40 = 24 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Davos paid:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

"To find out how much money Marisa puts in her piggy bank over 5 days, we need to calculate her daily savings and then multiply by 5.

First, let's determine how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day:
- Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops.
- Total cost of lollipops per day = 4 lollipops * 25 cents/lollipop = 100 cents = $1.00

Next, we calculate her daily savings:
- Marisa receives $5.00 each day.
- She spends $1.00 on lollipops.
- Daily savings = $5.00 - $1.00 = $4.00

Now, we calculate her total savings over 5 days:
- Daily savings = $4.00
- Total savings over 5 days = $4.00/day * 5 days = $20.00

Therefore, Marisa puts $20.00 in her piggy bank over 5 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

1. First, determine how much Billy spent on gumballs. Since each gumball costs $0.05 and he bought 40 gumballs:
   \[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \]
   So, Billy spent $2 on gumballs.

2. Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the total change he had before buying gumballs must be twice the amount he spent on gumballs:
   \[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \]
   So, Billy had $4 in change before buying gumballs.

3. Billy started with $10 and had $4 left after buying candy. Therefore, the amount he spent on candy is:
   \[ 10 - 4 = 6 \]
   So, Billy spent $6 on candy.

4. The cost of candy is $1.50 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy he bought, we divide the total amount spent on candy by the cost per pound:
   \[ 6 \div 1.5 = 4 \]
   So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the train travels in one complete trip and then determine how many days it can operate before reaching the 18,000-mile service interval.

1. Calculate the distance from the third city to the first city:
   - Combined distance from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city: 75 miles + 100 miles = 175 miles.
   - Distance from the third city to the first city: 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles.

2. Calculate the total distance for one complete trip:
   - Total distance = 75 miles + 100 miles + 125 miles = 300 miles.

3. Calculate the total distance traveled in one day:
   - The train makes 3 trips a day, so the total distance per day = 300 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 900 miles/day.

4. Determine how many days the train can operate before reaching 18,000 miles:

"Let's define the variables:
- Let \( x \) be the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
- Let \( y \) be the number of people kicked out for shoplifting.
- Let \( z \) be the number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.
- Let \( w \) be the number of people kicked out for other reasons.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( x = 3 \) (3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks).
2. \( y = 4x - 5 \) (the number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of mask refusers minus 5).
3. \( z = 3y \) (three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence).
4. The total number of people kicked out is 50: \( x + y + z + w = 50 \).

First, substitute \( x = 3 \) into the equation for \( y \):
\[ y = 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

Next, substitute \( y = 7 \) into the equation for \( z \):
\[ z = 3(7) = 21 \]

Now, substitute \( x = 3 \), \( y = 7 \), and \( z = 21 \) into the total equation:
\[ 3 + 7 + 21 + w = 50 \]

Solve for \( w \):
\[ 31 + w = 50 \]
\[ w = 50 - 31 \]
\[ w = 19 \]

Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:

"To calculate the monthly payment Karan has to make, we first need to determine the total interest and then the total amount to be repaid. The formula for simple interest is:

\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Where:
- Principal (P) = $3,650
- Rate (R) = 10% or 0.10
- Time (T) = 5 months (which is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of a year)

First, calculate the interest:

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 152.50 \]

Next, calculate the total amount to be repaid:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.50 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3802.50 \]

Now, to find the monthly payment, divide the total amount by the number of months:

Each cup is sold for $1.
\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total profit.**
The cost of supplies is $18.
\[ \text{Total profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Cost of supplies} \]
\[ \text{Total profit} = \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

**Step 4: Determine the total time it takes to sell all the lemonade.**
Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour.
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total number of cups}}{\text{Cups sold per hour}} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 5: Calculate the profit per hour.**
\[ \text{Profit per hour} = \frac{\text{Total profit}}{\text{Total time}} \]
\[ \text{Profit per hour} = \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \]

Therefore, Millie's profit per hour is:

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up an equation based on the information given. If he sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, then he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land equals 12.8 hectares. Let \( x \) represent the total amount of land he had initially. The equation is:

\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]

\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]

\[ x = 32 \]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To determine how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we first need to find the total number of gifts she is wrapping. Monica has:

- 6 gifts for her family
- 4 gifts for her friends
- 2 gifts for her teachers

Adding these together gives us the total number of gifts:
\[ 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \]

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to use for all the bows. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each bow, we divide the total length of ribbon by the total number of gifts:
\[ \frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ gifts}} = 12 \text{ inches per gift} \]

Therefore, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

"To solve this problem, we first need to understand the ratio and the total number of popsicles. The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6, which means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. Together, they have a total of 165 popsicles.

First, we find the total number of parts in the ratio:
5 (Betty's part) + 6 (Sam's part) = 11 parts

Next, we determine the value of one part by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
165 popsicles ÷ 11 parts = 15 popsicles per part

Now, we calculate the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 parts × 15 popsicles per part = 75 popsicles
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 parts × 15 popsicles per part = 90 popsicles

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
90 popsicles - 75 popsicles = 15 popsicles

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"To determine how much money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to streaming services, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services and then compare it to the cost of the cable package.

1. **Cost of Netflix:**
   - Netflix costs $10 per month.

2. **Cost of Hulu and Disney Plus with the bundle discount:**
   - Normally, each service costs $10 per month.
   - The bundle discount is 20%, so the total cost for both services is reduced by 20%.

   First, calculate the total cost without the discount:
   \[
   10 + 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   Next, calculate the discount amount:
   \[
   20 \times 0.20 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   Subtract the discount from the total cost:
   \[
   20 - 4 = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total cost of all streaming services:**
   - Netflix: $10
   - Hulu and Disney Plus bundle: $16
   \[
   10 + 16 = 26 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Savings by cancelling the cable package:**
   - Cable package cost: $60
   - Total cost of streaming services: $26
   \[
   60 - 26 = 34 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Tim saves $34 per month by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to the streaming services.

"To find the percentage of time Carol spent editing, we first need to calculate the total time she spent on all tasks and then determine what portion of that time was spent editing.

1. Time spent writing the song: 4 hours
2. Time spent recording the song: 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
3. Time spent editing the song: 90 minutes = 1.5 hours (since 90 minutes is 1.5 hours)

Next, we calculate the total time spent on all tasks:
Total time = 4 hours (writing) + 2 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7.5 hours

Now, we find the percentage of the total time that was spent editing:
Percentage of time spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total time) * 100
= (1.5 hours / 7.5 hours) * 100
= 0.2 * 100

"First, let's determine how many slices Bill and Mark each receive.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices:
\[ \text{Slices given to Bill} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

Next, Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark:
\[ \text{Slices given to Mark} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \]

Now, let's add up the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ \text{Total slices given to Bill and Mark} = 4 + 3 = 7 \]

Jenny eats 2 slices herself. So, the total number of slices eaten or given away is:
\[ \text{Total slices eaten or given away} = 7 + 2 = 9 \]

Finally, to find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total slices eaten or given away from the total number of slices:

"To determine how much Tyson would spend on meat and cheese, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of sandwiches needed to serve 20 people.
2. Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.
3. Calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of sandwiches needed.**
Each sandwich serves 4 people. Therefore, for 20 people:
\[ \text{Number of sandwiches} = \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.**
Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches:
\[ \text{Total meat required} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]
\[ \text{Total cheese required} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese.**
The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound, and the cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound. Therefore:
\[ \text{Total cost of meat} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 7 \text{ dollars per pound} = 35 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ \text{Total cost of cheese} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 3 \text{ dollars per pound} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 35 \text{ dollars} + 15 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Tyson would spend $50 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

2. Determine the number of employees remaining in June.
3. Calculate the total payment for June.
4. Sum the payments for both months.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May**
- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hours per week: 40
- Pay rate: $15 per hour
- Weeks in May: 4 (assuming a typical month)

Total payment for May:
\[ 40 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} \times \$15/\text{hour} \]
\[ = 40 \times 40 \times 4 \times 15 \]
\[ = 40 \times 2400 \]
\[ = \$96,000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of employees remaining in June**
- 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired in June.
- Number of employees whose contracts expired: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \)
- Number of employees remaining in June: \( 40 - 10 = 30 \)

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for June**
- Number of employees in June: 30

- Let \( J_a \) be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.
- Let \( S_t \) be the number of apples Joanne's sister gathers from the tallest trees.
- Let \( S_s \) be the number of apples Joanne's sister gathers from the shortest trees.
- Let \( S_a \) be the number of apples Joanne's sister gathers from the average trees.

From the problem, we know:
- \( J_t = 30 \)
- \( J_s = \frac{J_t}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \)
- \( S_t = 2 \times J_t = 2 \times 30 = 60 \)
- \( S_s = 3 \times J_s = 3 \times 15 = 45 \)
- \( S_a = 0 \)

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500:
\[ J_t + J_s + J_a + S_t + S_s + S_a = 500 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 30 + 15 + J_a + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 150 + J_a = 500 \]

Solving for \( J_a \):

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of camels as \( c \) and the number of dromedaries as \( d \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 180.
2. The total number of humps is 304.

We can translate these into the following equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \) (since each animal has one head)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \) (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump)

We can solve this system of equations step by step.

First, solve the first equation for \( d \):
\[ d = 180 - c \]

Next, substitute \( d \) in the second equation:
\[ 2c + (180 - c) = 304 \]
\[ 2c + 180 - c = 304 \]
\[ c + 180 = 304 \]
\[ c = 304 - 180 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Now, substitute \( c = 124 \) back into the equation \( d = 180 - c \):
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is 56.

"To calculate the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we can break down the trip into segments and sum the distances.

1. **First 4 days**: Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \)

2. **Next 2 days**: Tom traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days.
   - 30% of 800 km: \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \)
   - Total distance for the next 2 days: 240 km

3. **Next 1 day**: Tom wasn't traveling at all.
   - Total distance for this day: 0 km

4. **Second week (7 days)**: Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the second week: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \)

Now, summing up all the distances:
- First 4 days: 800 km
- Next 2 days: 240 km
- Next 1 day: 0 km
- Second week: 2100 km

Total distance traveled: \( 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \)

"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the elevation where the comb landed.
2. Determine the difference in elevation between where Oliver is and where the comb landed.

First, we know that Stanley was at an elevation of 10,000 feet and the comb fell 4,000 feet. Therefore, the elevation where the comb landed is:
\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we calculate the difference between the elevation of the comb and Oliver's current elevation:
\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the comb.

"First, we calculate the total number of cats carried away by the four boats. Since each boat carried away 5 cats, the total number of cats carried away is:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Next, we subtract the number of cats carried away by the boats from the initial number of cats on the rock:
\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Then, we calculate how many of the remaining 30 cats ran after the mouse. Since 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after the mouse, we find:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \]

Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

So, the number of cats left on the rock is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the original prices of the jeans:**
   - Let \( T \) be the original price of the tattered jeans.
   - Let \( J \) be the original price of the jogger jeans.
   - The tattered jeans are on sale for $28, so the discount on the tattered jeans is \( T - 28 \).
   - The jogger jeans are on sale for $22, so the discount on the jogger jeans is \( J - 22 \).

3. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.
   - He saved \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The savings from the tattered jeans is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Set up the equations for the discounts:**
   - The discount on the tattered jeans is \( T - 28 = 4 \).
   - The discount on the jogger jeans is \( J - 22 = 2 \).

5. **Solve for the original prices:**
   - From \( T - 28 = 4 \), we get \( T = 32 \).
   - From \( J - 22 = 2 \), we get \( J = 24 \).

6. **Determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:**
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The difference is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 more than the tattered jeans.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is 18 guests.
   - Therefore, he prepared 18 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 36 hotdogs for the second hotdogs.
   - Additionally, he prepared 36 - 18 = 18 hotdogs for the remaining guests who would have one hotdog each.
   - Total hotdogs prepared = 36 (for second hotdogs) + 18 (for one hotdog each) = 54 hotdogs.

2. **Actual Scenario:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Total hotdogs needed = 40 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 80 hotdogs.

3. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - The caterer only had 54 hotdogs.
   - The number of hotdogs short = 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs.

4. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each guest wanted a second hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is equal to the number of hotdogs short.
   - Therefore, 26 guests did not get a second hotdog.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. We know the area of the room and the length, so we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Given:
- Area = 360 square feet
- Length = 3 yards

First, convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard = 3 feet:

\[ \text{Length} = 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Now, use the area formula to find the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]

Solving for the width:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substitute the values:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

The perimeter of the room is 98 feet.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it took Jon to complete the triathlon and then determine how long it took James to complete each segment, including the run.

First, let's calculate Jon's total time:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the time it took James to complete each segment:
- James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. Therefore, James's swim time is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

- James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Therefore, James's bike time is:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( x \) be the time it took James to complete the run. According to the problem, Jon won by 10 minutes, so James's total time is:
\[ 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we can set up the equation for James's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 180 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]

"Let's set up the equation based on the information given. If you buy the super ticket, the total cost is $20 for the movie and $1 extra for the popcorn and soda. So, the total cost with the super ticket is $21.

If you buy the movie ticket without the super ticket, the cost is $12 for the movie. The soda costs $3, and let's denote the regular price of the popcorn as \( P \). The total cost without the super ticket is \( 12 + 3 + P \).

According to the problem, you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket. This means the cost without the super ticket is $2 less than the cost with the super ticket. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 12 + 3 + P = 21 - 2 \]

Simplify the right side:

\[ 12 + 3 + P = 19 \]

Combine the constants on the left side:

\[ 15 + P = 19 \]

Subtract 15 from both sides to solve for \( P \):

\[ P = 4 \]

So, the regular price of the popcorn is $4.

"To determine the total cost of the potting soil for Bob, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of one raised bed.
2. Multiply the volume of one raised bed by the number of beds to get the total volume of soil needed.
3. Determine how many bags of potting soil are required.
4. Calculate the total cost based on the number of bags needed.

Step 1: Calculate the volume of one raised bed.
The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (raised bed) is given by the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]
For one raised bed:
\[ V = 8 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} \times 2 \, \text{ft} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total volume of soil needed for 10 raised beds.
\[ \text{Total volume} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Step 3: Determine how many bags of potting soil are required.
Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil.
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Step 4: Calculate the total cost.
Each bag costs $12.
\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars/bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

The total cost for the potting soil is:

"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then the total weight of all the feed combined.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - 2 boxes, each weighing 1 pound.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags, each weighing 12 pounds.
   - Total weight of carrots = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales, each weighing 75 pounds.
   - Total weight of hay = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks, each weighing 65 pounds.
   - Total weight of oats = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Next, we sum the total weights of all the feed:
- Total weight of all feed = 2 (sugar cubes) + 48 (carrots) + 3150 (hay) + 1300 (oats) = 4500 pounds.

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity:
- Number of trips = Total weight of all feed / Truck capacity = 4500 / 2250 = 2.

Since the result is a whole number, the farmer needs exactly 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To determine how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up the equation based on the information given. Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set the equation equal to 5:

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to determine the weight of the 2010 penny. Given that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight as follows:

Weight of 2010 penny = \( \frac{3}{4} \times \) Weight of 1959 penny
Weight of 2010 penny = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \) grains
Weight of 2010 penny = 36 grains

Now, we add the weight of the 2010 penny to the weight of the 1959 penny to find the combined weight:

Combined weight = Weight of 2010 penny + Weight of 1959 penny
Combined weight = 36 grains + 48 grains
Combined weight = 84 grains

"To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for five days, we can break down the problem into several steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of oats one horse consumes per day:
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, one horse consumes \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).

2. Calculate the total amount of oats all four horses consume per day:
   - There are 4 horses.
   - Therefore, the total daily consumption for all horses is \(4 \text{ horses} \times 10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).

3. Calculate the total amount of oats needed for five days:
   - The total consumption for 5 days is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).

4. Determine how many 50-pound bags of oats are needed:

"To determine the cost per individual razor after all discounts, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Cost Calculation:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - Heather buys 2 packs, so the initial cost is \(2 \times 4.00 = 8.00\) dollars.

2. **Buy One Get One Free Promotion:**
   - With the buy one get one free promotion, Heather gets 2 packs for the price of 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is effectively $4.00.

3. **Applying the Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - Subtract the coupon from the cost: \(4.00 - 2.00 = 2.00\) dollars.

4. **Total Number of Razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - Heather buys 2 packs, so she gets \(2 \times 4 = 8\) razors.

5. **Cost per Razor:**
   - The total cost for 8 razors is $2.00.
   - The cost per razor is \(\frac{2.00}{8} = 0.25\) dollars.

6. **Convert to Cents:**
   - 0.25 dollars is equivalent to \(0.25 \times 100 = 25\) cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor after all discounts is 25 cents.

"First, let's determine the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so:
\[ 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, we calculate the number of oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, we find the total number of oranges they have together:
\[ 50 + 70 = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

To find out how many Greek orange pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed for one pie:

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation where the total cost for each venue is the same.

Let \( x \) be the number of guests.

**Cost for the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per person
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost for the second venue:**
- Cost per person: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We set the total costs equal to each other to find the number of guests \( x \) where the costs are the same:

\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( L \) represent the number of insects Lily found.
2. Let \( D \) represent the number of insects David found.
3. Let \( B \) represent the number of insects Bodhi found.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( L + D + B = 43 \) (Total insects collected)
2. \( L = D + 7 \) (Lily found 7 more than David)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \) (David found half of what Bodhi found)

First, we can substitute \( D \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ L = \frac{1}{2}B + 7 \]

Next, we substitute \( D \) and \( L \) into the first equation:
\[ \left(\frac{1}{2}B + 7\right) + \frac{1}{2}B + B = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ \frac{1}{2}B + \frac{1}{2}B + B + 7 = 43 \]
\[ 2B + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 2B = 36 \]

Divide by 2:
\[ B = 18 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 18 \) back into the equation for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9 \]

Finally, substitute \( D = 9 \) into the equation for \( L \):
\[ L = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects.

"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we first need to add the fractions of the skein they each used. Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. 

First, we convert \( \frac{1}{2} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 4 to make the addition easier:
\[ \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4} \]

Now, we add the fractions:
\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \]

This means they used \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein of yarn together. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we calculate the total yards used by multiplying \( \frac{3}{4} \) by 364:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273 \]

So, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"To determine the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all his sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the price per pair of snowshoes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of legs.
Mario has 6 sled dogs, and each dog has 4 legs.
Total number of legs = 6 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 24 legs

Step 2: Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2.
Number of pairs of snowshoes = 24 legs / 2 legs/pair = 12 pairs

Step 3: Calculate the total cost.
Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.

"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. First, determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies:
   \[
   \text{Cookies made by Josh} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9
   \]

2. Next, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we multiply the number of cookies Josh made by 2:
   \[
   \text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times 9 = 18
   \]

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies.

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially:

- Ali has four $10 bills, which is \(4 \times 10 = 40\) dollars.
- Ali has six $20 bills, which is \(6 \times 20 = 120\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money Ali has is \(40 + 120 = 160\) dollars.

Next, Ali gives her sister half of the total money:
- Half of $160 is \(\frac{160}{2} = 80\) dollars.

After giving her sister $80, Ali has \(160 - 80 = 80\) dollars left.

Then, Ali uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner:
- \(\frac{3}{5}\) of $80 is \(\frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48\) dollars.

After buying dinner, Ali has \(80 - 48 = 32\) dollars left.

"To solve this problem, we first need to convert Rob's time into minutes since the final answer is required in minutes. Rob takes 2 hours, and since 1 hour is 60 minutes, Rob takes:

2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes

According to the problem, Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes. So, we first find double the time Rob takes:

2 * 120 minutes = 240 minutes

Then, we add the additional 40 minutes that Royce takes:

240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes

Therefore, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle the house.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which each person picks strawberries and then sum these rates.

1. **Tony's rate**: Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
2. **Bobby's rate**: Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony. Therefore, Bobby picks \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
3. **Kathy's rate**: Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby. Therefore, Kathy picks \(2 \times 5 = 10\) quarts per hour.
4. **Ricky's rate**: Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy. Therefore, Ricky picks \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, we sum the rates of all four individuals:
- Tony: 6 quarts per hour
- Bobby: 5 quarts per hour
- Kathy: 10 quarts per hour
- Ricky: 8 quarts per hour

Total quarts picked per hour:

"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakers had left, we need to start with the total number of loaves baked and then subtract the number of loaves sold and add the number of loaves returned.

1. Total loaves baked: 200
2. Loaves sold in the morning: 93
3. Loaves sold in the afternoon: 39
4. Loaves returned: 6

First, calculate the total number of loaves sold:
93 (morning) + 39 (afternoon) = 132 loaves sold

Next, subtract the total loaves sold from the total loaves baked:
200 (baked) - 132 (sold) = 68 loaves remaining

Finally, add the loaves returned:
68 (remaining) + 6 (returned) = 74 loaves

So, the bakers had 74 loaves of bread left.

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Ada's current daily electric consumption cost.
2. Calculate the additional daily electric consumption cost of the new device.
3. Determine the total daily cost after adding the new device.
4. Calculate the weekly costs for both scenarios.
5. Find the difference between the two weekly costs.

**Step 1: Current daily electric consumption cost**
Ada's current daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. The cost per kilowatt per hour is $1.50.
\[ \text{Current daily cost} = 12 \, \text{kWh} \times 1.50 \, \text{\$/kWh} = 18 \, \text{\$} \]

**Step 2: Additional daily electric consumption cost of the new device**
The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour.
\[ \text{Additional daily cost} = 2 \, \text{kWh} \times 1.50 \, \text{\$/kWh} = 3 \, \text{\$} \]

**Step 3: Total daily cost after adding the new device**
\[ \text{Total daily cost} = 18 \, \text{\$} + 3 \, \text{\$} = 21 \, \text{\$} \]

**Step 4: Weekly costs for both scenarios**
\[ \text{Current weekly cost} = 18 \, \text{\$} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 126 \, \text{\$} \]
\[ \text{New weekly cost} = 21 \, \text{\$} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 147 \, \text{\$} \]

**Step 5: Difference between the two weekly costs**
\[ \text{Difference} = 147 \, \text{\$} - 126 \, \text{\$} = 21 \, \text{\$} \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house.

Next, we convert the days into hours. Assuming a standard workday of 8 hours, 10 days is equivalent to:
\[ 10 \text{ days} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 80 \text{ hours} \]

So, one person can paint a whole house in 80 hours. 

Now, if 5 people are working together, their combined rate is 5 times the rate of one person. Therefore, the time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house is:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ hours}}{5} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

"Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as \( C_O \) and the number of sofas Ophelia has as \( S_O \). Similarly, let's denote the number of chairs Jenna has as \( C_J \) and the number of sofas Jenna has as \( S_J \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs: \( S_O = C_O - 2 \).
2. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia: \( C_J = 3C_O \).
3. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs: \( S_J = C_J - 2 \).
4. Ophelia has 20 sofas: \( S_O = 20 \).

First, we use the information that Ophelia has 20 sofas to find the number of chairs she has:
\[ S_O = C_O - 2 \]
\[ 20 = C_O - 2 \]
\[ C_O = 22 \]

Next, we use the number of chairs Ophelia has to find the number of chairs Jenna has:
\[ C_J = 3C_O \]
\[ C_J = 3 \times 22 \]
\[ C_J = 66 \]

Now, we use the number of chairs Jenna has to find the number of sofas she has:
\[ S_J = C_J - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 66 - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 64 \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have:
\[ \text{Total sofas} = S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84 \]
\[ \text{Total chairs} = C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88 \]
\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

"To determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not purchased the headphone set, we first need to find out how much the headphone set cost. We know the total amount Tom spent and the cost of one CD.

1. Let's denote the cost of the headphone set as \( H \).
2. The total amount Tom spent is the sum of the cost of the CD and the cost of the headphone set:
   \[
   4 + H = 48
   \]
3. Solving for \( H \):
   \[
   H = 48 - 4 = 44

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we can start by calculating the total hours if he had worked out 4 hours every week, and then adjust for the weeks where he worked out more.

1. Calculate the total hours if he worked out 4 hours each week for 8 weeks:
   \( 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ hours} \)

2. Adjust for the weeks where he worked out more:
   - For the two weeks he worked out 5 hours each week:
     \( 5 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 10 \text{ hours} \)
   - For the one week he worked out 6 hours:
     \( 6 \text{ hours} \)

3. Calculate the total extra hours:
   \( 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ hours} \)

4. Subtract the regular hours for the three weeks where he worked out more:
   \( 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 12 \text{ hours} \)

5. Calculate the adjusted total:
   \( 32 \text{ hours} - 12 \text{ hours} + 16 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ hours} \)

The total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is 36.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine Jame's current age and then use that information to find out his cousin's current age. Finally, we will calculate the difference between their ages.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \).

2. **Set up the equation for Jame's cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.
   - In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Let \( C \) be Jame's cousin's current age.
   - In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be \( C + 8 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, \( C + 8 = 2 \times 30 - 5 \).

3. **Solve for \( C \):**
   - \( C + 8 = 60 - 5 \)
   - \( C + 8 = 55 \)
   - \( C = 55 - 8 \)
   - \( C = 47 \)

4. **Calculate the age difference:**
   - Jame's current age is 22.
   - Jame's cousin's current age is 47.
   - The age difference is \( 47 - 22 = 25 \).

The number of years that separate the age of the two now is 25.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the cost of each item:**
   - The cost of the computer is given as $1,100.
   - The cost of the printer is $400 less than the computer, so the printer costs \( 1100 - 400 = 700 \) dollars.
   - Let the cost of one monitor be \( x \) dollars.

2. **Set up the equation:**
   - The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400.
   - Therefore, the equation is: 
     \[
     1100 + 2x + 700 = 2400
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Combine the known costs:
     \[
     1100 + 700 = 1800
     \]
   - Subtract this sum from the total cost:
     \[
     2400 - 1800 = 600
     \]
   - This gives us the total cost of the 2 monitors:
     \[
     2x = 600
     \]
   - Divide by 2 to find the cost of one monitor:
     \[
     x = \frac{600}{2} = 300
     \]

So, the cost of one monitor is \( 300 \) dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of seashells each girl brought back. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Determine the number of boys and girls:**
   - There are 20 kids in total.
   - They are divided into two equal groups of boys and girls.
   - Therefore, there are \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) boys and \( 10 \) girls.

2. **Calculate the number of seashells each boy brought:**
   - Each boy brought back 60 seashells.

3. **Calculate the number of seashells each girl brought:**
   - Each girl brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.
   - This can be expressed as: \( 60 + 4 \times 60 \).

4. **Perform the multiplication and addition:**
   - \( 4 \times 60 = 240 \)
   - \( 60 + 240 = 300 \)

Therefore, each girl brought back 300 seashells.

"Let's denote the number of candies George originally had as \( G \). According to the problem, Nick had twice as many candies as George, so Nick had \( 2G \) candies.

After George ate 5 candies, he has 3 candies left. This can be expressed as:
\[ G - 5 = 3 \]

To find \( G \), we solve the equation:
\[ G - 5 = 3 \]
\[ G = 3 + 5 \]
\[ G = 8 \]

So, George originally had 8 candies. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, we calculate:
\[ 2G = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Therefore, Nick has 16 candies.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly saving target of $1125. April has 30 days, so the first half of the month consists of 15 days, and the second half also consists of 15 days.

Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of the month. Therefore, in the first half of the month, he saves \( 15x \).

Since he wants to save twice as much daily in the second half, he will save \( 2x \) each day in the second half. Therefore, in the second half of the month, he saves \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings from the first half and the second half:
\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

We know that the total savings for the month should be $1125:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

Since \( x \) is the amount saved each day in the first half, the amount saved each day in the second half is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis needs to save $50 each day in the second half of the month.

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:

"To solve this, let's break down Elise's writing process:

1. First, she writes the full alphabet twice. The English alphabet has 26 letters, so writing it twice means she writes \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.
2. Next, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 is 13, so she writes 13 more letters.
3. Then, she re-writes everything she has already written. At this point, she has written \(52 + 13 = 65\) letters. Rewriting all of these means she writes another 65 letters.

Adding all of these together, the total number of letters Elise has written is \(52 + 13 + 65 = 130\).

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of the phone tree. Each person calls 3 other families, and this process repeats. This forms a geometric sequence where the number of families contacted in each round is a power of 3.

- In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.
- In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 more families, so \(3 \times 3 = 3^2 = 9\) families are contacted.
- In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 more families, so \(9 \times 3 = 3^3 = 27\) families are contacted.
- In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 more families, so \(27 \times 3 = 3^4 = 81\) families are contacted.

"To calculate the total cost for Daniel, we first need to determine the cost of each item before the discount:

- Notebooks: 5 notebooks * $1.50 per notebook = $7.50
- Pens: 2 pens * $0.25 per pen = $0.50
- Calculator: 1 calculator * $12.00 per calculator = $12.00
- Geometry set: 1 geometry set * $10.00 per geometry set = $10.00

Next, we add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:
Total cost before discount = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

Now, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
Discount amount = 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00

Subtract the discount from the total cost before discount to find the final cost:
Final cost = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Ray takes to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water, and then find the difference between these times.

1. **Time to swim 1 mile in cold water:**
   - Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes.

2. **Time to swim 1 mile in warm water:**
   - Ray swims 1 mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water.
   - Twice the time for cold water: \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
   - Adding 2 minutes: \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.

3. **Time to swim 3 miles in cold water:**
   - \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes.

4. **Time to swim 3 miles in warm water:**
   - \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes.

5. **Difference in time to swim 3 miles:**
   - \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

Thus, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a warm day than on a cold day.

"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the pages read in the first week and add them to the pages read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- Total reading time in the first week = 15 minutes/night * 7 nights = 105 minutes.

Next, we convert the total reading time into pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- Reading speed = 2 pages / 1.5 minutes = 1.3333 pages per minute.
- Total pages read in the first week = 105 minutes * 1.3333 pages/minute = 140 pages.

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

Now, we add the pages read in both weeks:
- Total pages read in two weeks = 140 pages (first week) + 100 pages (second week) = 240 pages.

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \). According to the problem, Shiloh is 44 years old today, so \( S = 44 \).

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \) and his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \). The problem states that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This can be expressed as:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substituting \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"To find out how much money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we can break down the payments as follows:

1. For the first tooth, Sharon received $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, Sharon received $1.00 each, so for three teeth, that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half of $1.00 per tooth, which is $0.50 per tooth. So for two teeth, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, we add up all the amounts:
- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

Total amount = $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given.

Let:
- \( R \) be the number of goals Richie scored,
- \( M \) be the number of goals Mark scored,
- \( A \) be the number of goals Anna scored.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( R = 80 \) (Richie scored 80 goals)
2. \( R = M + 20 \) (Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark)
3. \( R = A + 45 \) (Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna)

First, substitute \( R = 80 \) into the second and third equations:
- \( 80 = M + 20 \)
- \( 80 = A + 45 \)

Solve for \( M \) and \( A \):
- \( M = 80 - 20 = 60 \)
- \( A = 80 - 45 = 35 \)

Now, we need to find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off when set to 450 degrees. The actual temperature is 468 degrees, so the oven is overheating by 18 degrees.

1. Calculate the percentage increase:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Temperature} - \text{Set Temperature}}{\text{Set Temperature}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 0.04 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 4\% \]

2. Now, we need to find the set temperature that will result in an actual temperature of 520 degrees, given that the oven is off by 4%.

Let \( x \) be the set temperature. The actual temperature is 4% more than the set temperature:
\[ \text{Actual Temperature} = x + 0.04x \]
\[ \text{Actual Temperature} = 1.04x \]

We know the actual temperature should be 520 degrees:
\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

3. Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]
\[ x = 500 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

Next, we need to determine the total number of contacts Pete gets from 2 boxes:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Since each pair of contacts is used for one day, and he gets 180 contacts, he has 90 pairs of contacts (since each pair consists of 2 contacts).

Now, we calculate the cost per pair of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ 2.00 \]

"To determine how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we first need to calculate the total hours each of them worked and then compute their earnings.

**Jill's Hours:**
- Saturday: 2 hours
- Sunday: 1 hour
- Total hours worked by Jill: 2 + 1 = 3 hours

**John's Hours:**
- Saturday: John worked twice as long as Jill, so 2 * 2 = 4 hours
- Sunday: John worked three times as long as Jill, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours
- Total hours worked by John: 4 + 3 = 7 hours

**Earnings Calculation:**
- Jill's earnings: 3 hours * $10/hour = $30
- John's earnings: 7 hours * $10/hour = $70

**Difference in Earnings:**
- John's earnings - Jill's earnings = $70 - $30 = $40

John earned $40 more than Jill.

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans \( G \) is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. We can express these relationships with the following equations:

\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500, so we can write the equation:

\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \):

\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combine the terms:

\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solve for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:

\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Thus, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to grow from 4 feet to a height greater than 20 feet, given that it doubles in height every day.

Let's denote the height of the beanstalk on day \( n \) as \( H(n) \). The initial height of the beanstalk is 4 feet, so \( H(0) = 4 \) feet. Since the beanstalk doubles its height every day, the height on day \( n \) can be expressed as:
\[ H(n) = 4 \times 2^n \]

We need to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that \( H(n) > 20 \):
\[ 4 \times 2^n > 20 \]

First, divide both sides of the inequality by 4:
\[ 2^n > 5 \]

Next, we need to find the smallest integer \( n \) that satisfies this inequality. We can do this by testing successive values of \( n \):

- For \( n = 0 \): \( 2^0 = 1 \) (not greater than 5)
- For \( n = 1 \): \( 2^1 = 2 \) (not greater than 5)
- For \( n = 2 \): \( 2^2 = 4 \) (not greater than 5)
- For \( n = 3 \): \( 2^3 = 8 \) (greater than 5)

Thus, the smallest integer \( n \) that satisfies the inequality is \( n = 3 \).

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the protein content per gram of mushrooms:**
   - A cup of mushrooms (100 grams) contains 3 grams of protein.
   - Therefore, 1 gram of mushrooms contains \( \frac{3}{100} = 0.03 \) grams of protein.

2. **Calculate the protein content for 200 grams of mushrooms:**
   - If 1 gram of mushrooms contains 0.03 grams of protein, then 200 grams of mushrooms contain \( 200 \times 0.03 = 6 \) grams of protein.

3. **Calculate the weekly protein intake:**
   - John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, so he gets 6 grams of protein per day.
   - Over a week (7 days), he gets \( 6 \times 7 = 42 \) grams of protein.

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms.

"To determine how many hours George needs to work to pay for his dental work, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the dental work.
2. Subtract the deposit he has already paid.
3. Determine how much more he needs to pay.
4. Calculate how many hours he needs to work to earn the remaining amount.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the dental work.**

- Each implant costs $2000.
- He needs 2 implants, so the cost for the implants is:
  \[
  2 \times 2000 = 4000
  \]
- One of the implants requires a porcelain crown, which costs an additional $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the dental work is:
  \[
  4000 + 500 = 4500
  \]

**Step 2: Subtract the deposit he has already paid.**

- George has already paid a deposit of $600.
- The remaining amount he needs to pay is:
  \[
  4500 - 600 = 3900
  \]

**Step 3: Determine how much more he needs to pay.**

- George needs to pay $3900 more.

**Step 4: Calculate how many hours he needs to work to earn the remaining amount.**

- George earns $15 per hour.
- The number of hours he needs to work to earn $3900 is:
  \[
  \frac{3900}{15} = 260
  \]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours to pay for the dental work.

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = 30 \]

The largest angle is \( 3x \):
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

The measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

1. **Quarters**: Each quarter is worth 25 cents. Colby has 8 quarters.
   \[ 8 \times 25 = 200 \text{ cents} \]

2. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth 10 cents. Colby has 6 dimes.
   \[ 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ cents} \]

3. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth 5 cents. Colby has 14 nickels.
   \[ 14 \times 5 = 70 \text{ cents} \]

4. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth 1 cent. Colby has 15 pennies.
   \[ 15 \times 1 = 15 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we add up all the amounts to find the total:
\[ 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 \text{ cents} \]

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:
\[ 345 \div 5 = 69 \]

Therefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which the plane is traveling. The rate (speed) can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Given that the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, the rate is:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this rate. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Rate}} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 additional hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate.

"First, let's determine the rate at which Ruiz makes chocolates. Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours, so his rate is:
\[ \text{Ruiz's rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find Marissa's rate. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, Marissa's rate is:
\[ \text{Marissa's rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ pounds per hour} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of chocolates they make together in one hour:
\[ \text{Combined rate} = \text{Ruiz's rate} + \text{Marissa's rate} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} + 90 \text{ pounds per hour} = 150 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

If they work for 12 hours in a day, the total amount of chocolates they make together is:
\[ \text{Total chocolates} = \text{Combined rate} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 150 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1800 \text{ pounds} \]

- Earnings from the first four hours = 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30.00.

For the next two hours:
- He sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Total cups sold in two hours = 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups.
- Earnings from the next two hours = 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12.00.

Total earnings = Earnings from the first four hours + Earnings from the next two hours = $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one month.
2. Determine the total number of rotations the tires undergo in one year.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for the tires to reach the maximum number of rotations before they need to be replaced.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations in one month.**

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. We know that every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. Therefore, the number of rotations per mile is:
\[ \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} \]

For 400 miles:
\[ 400 \text{ miles} \times 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of rotations in one year.**

There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ 145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations per year} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many years it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations.**

\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations per year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

"To find the cost per pump of shampoo, we first need to determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from the bottle if she uses 1 pump per wash. Since the bottle provides 120 washes with 2 pumps per wash, it will provide twice as many washes with 1 pump per wash:

120 washes * 2 = 240 washes

Next, we calculate the cost per wash. The bottle costs $24.00, and it will now provide 240 washes:

$24.00 / 240 washes = $0.10 per wash

Since each wash uses 1 pump, the cost per pump is the same as the cost per wash:

\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take to sell 750 kg of meat:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we first need to convert the required height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 4 feet is equal to:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Adam is currently 40 inches tall and grows 2 inches each year. We need to find out how many years it will take for him to reach 48 inches. We can set up the equation:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches/year} \times \text{years} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Solving for the number of years:

\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \times \text{years} = 48 \text{ inches} - 40 \text{ inches} \]
\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \times \text{years} = 8 \text{ inches} \]
\[ \text{years} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} \]
\[ \text{years} = 4 \]

"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total sales revenue from the cars.
2. Determine the total cost to acquire the cars.
3. Calculate the profit from the sales.
4. Calculate James's commission based on the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total sales revenue.**
James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
\[ \text{Total Sales Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the total cost to acquire the cars.**
The company paid 30% of the sales price to acquire each car.
\[ \text{Cost per Car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost to Acquire Cars} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit from the sales.**
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Sales Revenue} - \text{Total Cost to Acquire Cars} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

**Step 4: Calculate James's commission.**
James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
\[ \text{James's Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

James made:

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between them. The key is to find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob.

1. Calculate the relative speed:
   - Tom's speed: 70 mph
   - Bob's speed: 55 mph
   - Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed = 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

2. Determine the time it takes to close the 75-mile gap:
   - Distance to be covered: 75 miles
   - Time = Distance / Relative speed = 75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we first calculate the cost per class if he attends all 10 classes. The total cost is $60, so the cost per class is:

\[ \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars per class} \]

This is within the limit set by his parents. Now, we need to find out how many classes he can miss before the cost per class he attends exceeds $10.

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny misses. Then, he attends \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class he attends is:

\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We set this equal to $10 to find the maximum number of classes he can miss:

\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} = 10 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 60 = 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 = 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x = 40 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

So, Manny can miss 4 classes before the cost per class he attends exceeds $10. If he misses 5 or more classes, the cost per class will be more than $10, and his parents won't sign him up again.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the distances run by each person:**
   - Paisley ran 4 miles.
   - Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran.
   - Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn.

2. **Calculate the distance Reggie ran:**
   - Since Paisley ran 4 miles, Reggie ran \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) miles.

3. **Set up the equation for Lynn's distance:**
   - Let \( L \) be the distance Lynn ran.
   - According to the problem, Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so we can write the equation:
     \[
     20 = L + 3

- Sales from green hats in the first month = 2 * $400 = $800

Step 2: Calculate the total sales for the first month.
- Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
- Total sales in the first month = $400 + $800 = $1200

Step 3: Calculate the total sales for the second month.
- Sales in the second month = 3/4 * Total sales in the first month
- Sales in the second month = 3/4 * $1200 = $900

Step 4: Sum the sales from both months to get the total amount made in two months.
- Total sales in two months = Total sales in the first month + Total sales in the second month
- Total sales in two months = $1200 + $900 = $2100

"To determine how much James paid for the horse-drawn carriage, we need to break down the costs based on the given conditions:

1. James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.
2. He gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.
3. The first paid hour costs $15.
4. Each subsequent hour costs twice the previous hour.

Let's calculate the cost for each paid hour:
- First hour: $15
- Second hour: $15 * 2 = $30
- Third hour: $30 * 2 = $60

Now, we sum up the costs for the 3 paid hours:
$15 + $30 + $60 = $105

Therefore, the total amount James paid is:

"To find out how much was withheld from Sally's wage, we need to determine how much she actually received and then compare it to what she should have received.

1. First, calculate the total amount added to her bank account this week by subtracting the initial amount from the current amount:
   $420 (current amount) - $200 (initial amount) = $220 (amount added).

2. Sally should have received $300 as her weekly wage. To find out how much was withheld, subtract the amount she actually received from the amount she should have received:
   $300 (expected wage) - $220 (actual amount received) = $80 (amount withheld).

Therefore, $80 were withheld from Sally’s wage.

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:
   Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and there are 16 guests.
   \[
   3 \text{ deviled egg halves/guest} \times 16 \text{ guests} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves}
   \]

2. Determine how many whole eggs are needed:
   Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many whole eggs are required to make 48 deviled egg halves.
   \[
   \frac{48 \text{ deviled egg halves}}{2 \text{ deviled egg halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs}
   \]

3. Convert the number of whole eggs to dozens:
   There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
   \[
   \frac{24 \text{ whole eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozens}
   \]

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs.

"To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate the total number of days it will take him to read the 200-page book at a rate of 10 pages per day.

First, we calculate the total number of days required to read the book:
\[ \text{Total days required} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}} = \frac{200 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages/day}} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Next, we subtract the number of days required from the total number of days available to find out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish:
\[ \text{Days before the deadline} = \text{Total days available} - \text{Total days required} = 30 \text{ days} - 20 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.

"To calculate the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly hanger rental, and the monthly fuel expenses.

1. Initial cost of the plane: $150,000
2. Monthly hanger rental: $5,000
3. Monthly fuel cost: $5,000 * 2 = $10,000

Now, we calculate the total monthly maintenance cost:
- Monthly maintenance cost (hanger + fuel) = $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000

Next, we calculate the total maintenance cost for the year:
- Annual maintenance cost = $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the annual maintenance cost:
- Total cost for the first year = $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cooking time for rice**: Given as 30 minutes.
2. **Cooking time for pork**: It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. Therefore, the cooking time for pork is:
   \[
   30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]
3. **Cooking time for beans**: Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. First, we calculate the combined cooking time of pork and rice:
   \[
   30 + 50 = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Then, the cooking time for beans is:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Total cooking time**: To find the total cooking time for all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans:
   \[
   30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, the total cooking time for all the food is 120 minutes.

- 1/3 pound of walnuts at $15 per pound: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars
- Total cost of the first mixture: \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture:
- 1/5 pound of almonds at $10 per pound: \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars
- 1/3 pound of walnuts at $15 per pound: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars
- Total cost of the second mixture: \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- Difference: \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

1. Each animal has one head, so the total number of heads gives us the equation:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]

2. Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs, so the total number of legs gives us the equation:
   \[
   4S + 2G = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
   \[
   2S + G = 35
   \]

Now we have the system of equations:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]
   \[
   2S + G = 35
   \]

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
   \[
   (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20
   \]
   \[
   2S + G - S - G = 15
   \]
   \[
   S = 15
   \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( S = 15 \).

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much money each person has individually, and then we can find out how much each would have if they shared the total amount equally.

1. **Determine Kassidy's amount:**
   - Aurelia has $120.
   - Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia.
   - Therefore, Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90\) dollars.

2. **Determine Rayna's amount:**
   - Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy.
   - Therefore, Rayna has \(90 + 60 = 150\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money:**
   - Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
   - Total money = \(120 + 90 + 150 = 360\) dollars.

4. **Determine the amount each would have if shared equally:**
   - There are 3 people, so each would get \(\frac{360}{3} = 120\) dollars.

Thus, each person would have 120 dollars if they shared the total amount equally.

"To solve this, let's break down the information:

- Total days: 30
- Good days initially: 12
- Bad days: 8
- Neutral days: 30 - 12 - 8 = 10

The pattern of the first 24 days is:
- First 8 days: Good
- Second 8 days: Bad
- Third 8 days: Neutral

This matches the total counts of good, bad, and neutral days. Now, for the next three days:
- Day 25: Good
- Day 26: Neutral
- Day 27: Good

So, the total number of good days after these three days is:
- Initial good days: 12
- Additional good days: 2 (Day 25 and Day 27)

Total good days: 12 + 2 = 14

Since the month has 30 days, and we are now at day 27, there are 3 days left in the month. The question asks how many good days are left in the month. Since the next three days (25, 26, 27) have already been accounted for, and none of the remaining days (28, 29, 30) are specified, we assume they are neutral.

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is 0.

To find \( x \), we first subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 18 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so now there are 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
3. James buys toys for these 12 dogs, so he buys 12 toys.
4. After buying the toys, he finds out there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. Initially, there were 12 dogs, so now there are 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.
5. James needs to buy toys for these 24 dogs. He already has 12 toys, so he needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys.
6. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so now there are 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.
7. James no longer needs toys for the 3 dogs that are gone, so he has 12 + 12 = 24 toys, but he only needs 21 toys.

Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is 21.

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of cookies each person has in terms of the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has. Let's denote the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as \( C \).

1. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so Max has \( C + 12 \) cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Katarina has \( (C + 12) - 5 = C + 7 \) cookies.
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has \( (C + 12) + 23 = C + 35 \) cookies.

We know that Katarina has 68 cookies, so we can set up the equation:

"To find the original length of the dress, let's denote the original length of the dress as \( L \) cm.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the extension is \( 0.5L \) cm. Additionally, she adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom of the dress. Therefore, the total length of the final dress is the sum of the original length, the extension, and the lace trim:

\[ L + 0.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we isolate \( L \) by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Now, we solve for \( L \) by dividing both sides by 1.5:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many coins Neil saves each month compared to Rong.

Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong. This means Neil saves:
\[ 20 + \left(20 \times \frac{2}{5}\right) = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each of them saves over ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so over ten years, there are:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong's total savings over ten years:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings over ten years:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding both totals together gives the combined savings:
\[ 2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20:
2 vaccines * $20/vaccine = $40

Let \( T \) be the total bill. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so:
Heartworm check = 0.60 * \( T \)

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\( T = 40 + 0.60T \)

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\( T - 0.60T = 40 \)
0.40T = 40
\( T = 40 / 0.40 \)
\( T = 100 \)

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
$125 - $100 = $25

"To calculate the total price of the crate, we need to determine the cost of each type of fruit and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = \$1.0\).
   - There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = \$5.0\).

2. **Cost of apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = \$6.0\).

3. **Cost of oranges:**
   - One orange costs three times as much as one banana.
   - One banana costs $1.0, so one orange costs \(3 \times 1.0 = \$3.0\).
   - There are 7 oranges in the crate, so the total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = \$21.0\).

4. **Total cost of the crate:**
   - Sum the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges: \(5.0 + 6.0 + 21.0 = \$32.0\).

The price for such a crate of fruit is $32.0.

"To find the total number of squares on Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares**: The problem states there are 14 red squares.
2. **Blue Squares**: There are 4 more blue squares than red squares. Therefore, the number of blue squares is:
   \[
   14 + 4 = 18
   \]
3. **Green Squares**: There are 6 more green squares than blue squares. Therefore, the number of green squares is:
   \[
   18 + 6 = 24
   \]
4. **White Squares**: There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. Therefore, the number of white squares is:
   \[
   24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
\[
14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68
\]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

"First, let's determine the number of points each student has collected.

1. Adam has collected 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 
   - 30% of 50 points is \( 0.30 \times 50 = 15 \) points.
   - Therefore, Betty has \( 50 + 15 = 65 \) points.
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
   - Therefore, Tom has \( 65 - 30 = 35 \) points.
4. Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom.
   - Therefore, Martha has \( 3 \times 35 = 105 \) points.

Next, let's calculate the total points collected by the class:
- Adam: 50 points
- Betty: 65 points
- Tom: 35 points
- Martha: 105 points

Total points = \( 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 \) points.

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. Therefore, the class is missing:

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( G \) represent the amount of gravel Gary's truck can haul.
2. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.
3. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can haul \( 4000 + 800 = 4800 \) pounds of gravel.
4. The total amount of gravel the three trucks can haul together is 11,600 pounds.

We can write the equation for the total amount of gravel as:
\[ 4000 + 4800 + G = 11600 \]

Now, solve for \( G \):
\[ 8800 + G = 11600 \]
\[ G = 11600 - 8800 \]
\[ G = 2800 \]

So, Gary's truck can carry 2800 pounds of gravel.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the turtle. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

The cat's speed is 15 feet/second. Therefore, the turtle's speed is:
\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we need to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We use the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Substituting the turtle's speed and the time:
\[ \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages.

The cat takes 30 minutes to eat nine sausages. The dog takes \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the time the cat takes. Therefore, the time the dog takes is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is given by:
\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Time taken by cat} + \text{Time taken by dog}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Average time} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches, so 8 feet = 8 * 12 = 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, the total length of Topher's shoe is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

Let \( x \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. This can be written as:
\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]
Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 90 = 9x \]
Divide both sides by 9:
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby’s shoes is 10 inches.

"To find out how many puppies Jana has, we can start by determining the total number of Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls and there are 6 Pomeranian girls, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Total Pomeranians} = 6 \]

Solving for the total number of Pomeranians:

\[ \text{Total Pomeranians} = 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Next, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let \( P \) represent the total number of puppies. We can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times P = 18 \]

Solving for \( P \):

\[ P = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27 \]

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \). According to the problem:

- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs half of the second).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the third house needs double the first).

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases, so:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Thus, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total distance the Llesis family traveled, which includes both the distance they drove and the distance they hiked.

First, let's find the hiking speed:
- The driving speed is 50 miles per hour.
- The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed.
- Half the driving speed is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) miles per hour.
- The hiking speed is \( 25 - 5 = 20 \) miles per hour.

Next, we calculate the distance they hiked:
- They hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour.
- The distance hiked is \( 1.5 \times 20 = 30 \) miles.

Now, we calculate the distance they drove:
- The total time for the trip is 6 hours.
- They spent 1.5 hours hiking, so they spent \( 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 \) hours driving.
- The distance driven is \( 4.5 \times 50 = 225 \) miles.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given:

Let:
- \( E_A \) be the number of enemies Ava jumps on.
- \( E_E \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- \( B_A \) be the number of berries Ava collects.
- \( B_E \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- \( T_A \) be the number of seconds left on the timer when Ava finishes.
- \( T_E \) be the number of seconds left on the timer when Emma finishes.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( E_A = E_E + 8 \)
2. \( B_A = B_E + 3 \)
3. \( T_A = T_E - 4 \)

The score for each player is calculated as follows:
- Ava's score: \( S_A = 10E_A + 5B_A + 30T_A \)
- Emma's score: \( S_E = 10E_E + 5B_E + 30T_E \)

We need to find the difference between their scores, \( S_A - S_E \).

Substitute the expressions for \( E_A \), \( B_A \), and \( T_A \) into the equation for \( S_A \):

\[ S_A = 10(E_E + 8) + 5(B_E + 3) + 30(T_E - 4) \]
\[ S_A = 10E_E + 80 + 5B_E + 15 + 30T_E - 120 \]
\[ S_A = 10E_E + 5B_E + 30T_E - 25 \]

Now, the difference in scores is:

\[ S_A - S_E = (10E_E + 5B_E + 30T_E - 25) - (10E_E + 5B_E + 30T_E) \]
\[ S_A - S_E = -25 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( x \) as the number of orange fish Bob bought.
- \( y \) as the number of white fish Bob bought.

Initially, Bob had:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

After buying 17 more fish, the total number of fish Bob has is:
- \( 3 + x \) orange fish
- \( 4 + y \) white fish

We know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17:
\[ x + y = 17 \]

We also know that after adding the new fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish:
\[ 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \]

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

First, simplify the second equation:
\[ 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \]
\[ 3 + x = 8 + 2y \]
\[ x - 2y = 5 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( x + y = 17 \)
2. \( x - 2y = 5 \)

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

From the first equation, solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 17 - y \]

Substitute \( x = 17 - y \) into the second equation:
\[ 17 - y - 2y = 5 \]
\[ 17 - 3y = 5 \]
\[ -3y = 5 - 17 \]
\[ -3y = -12 \]
\[ y = 4 \]

Now substitute \( y = 4 \) back into the first equation to find \( x \):
\[ x + 4 = 17 \]
\[ x = 13 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many OLED TVs Samwell's store sold, we first need to determine the fraction of the total sales that OLED TVs represent. We know that one-fourth of the sales are smart TVs and one-eighth are analog TVs. Let's add these fractions to find the total fraction of sales that are not OLED TVs:

\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{8} \]

This means that \(\frac{3}{8}\) of the total sales are either smart TVs or analog TVs. Therefore, the fraction of the total sales that are OLED TVs is:

\[ 1 - \frac{3}{8} = \frac{8}{8} - \frac{3}{8} = \frac{5}{8} \]

Now, we know that the total number of TVs sold is 40. To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we multiply the total number of TVs by the fraction that represents OLED TVs:

\[ 40 \times \frac{5}{8} = 40 \times 0.625 = 25 \]

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25.

So, there are 10 groups in total.

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups had members bring back seashells. According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the groups each had members bring back 2 seashells each. We calculate \( \frac{3}{5} \) of 10:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]

So, 6 groups had members bring back seashells.

Each of these 6 groups had 9 members, and each member brought back 2 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back by each group is:

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Since there are 6 groups, the total number of seashells brought back is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the hourly rates for both Billy and Sally and then determine the difference in their earnings for 20 hours of work.

1. **Billy's hourly rate:**
   - Initial rate: $10 per hour
   - After 2 months: $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour
   - On his first anniversary: $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour

2. **Sally's hourly rate:**
   - Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary.
   - Billy's starting salary: $10 per hour
   - Sally's starting salary: $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour

3. **Earnings for 20 hours:**
   - Billy's earnings: $11.50 per hour * 20 hours = $230
   - Sally's earnings: $10.50 per hour * 20 hours = $210

4. **Difference in earnings:**
   - Billy's earnings - Sally's earnings = $230 - $210 = $20

Therefore, Billy will earn $20 more than Sally for 20 hours of work.

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy to make them 30% of her total collection, we first need to calculate the current total number of stuffed animals she has.

Bubbles currently has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Adding these together gives:
3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 stuffed animals

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. This can be expressed as:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

To solve for \( x \), we first distribute the 0.30:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 0.30x from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the relative speed at which the second car is pulling away from the first car and then find out how much distance this relative speed will cover in 2 hours.

1. **Calculate the relative speed:**
   - The speed of the first car is 60 miles per hour.
   - The speed of the second car is 70 miles per hour.
   - The relative speed is the difference between the speeds of the two cars: \( 70 \text{ mph} - 60 \text{ mph} = 10 \text{ mph} \).

2. **Calculate the distance covered by the relative speed in 2 hours:**
   - The relative speed is 10 miles per hour.
   - In 2 hours, the distance covered at this relative speed is: \( 10 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ miles} \).

"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of mosaic he can create with the total number of glass chips.
3. Given the height of the mosaic, calculate the length of the mosaic.

First, calculate the total number of glass chips:
Milo has 2 bags of glass chips, and each bag holds 72 chips.
\[ 2 \text{ bags} \times 72 \text{ chips per bag} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, determine how many square inches of mosaic he can create with 144 chips:
It takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch of mosaic.
\[ 144 \text{ chips} \div 12 \text{ chips per square inch} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Now, given that the mosaic is 3 inches tall, calculate the length of the mosaic:
The area of the mosaic is 12 square inches, and the height is 3 inches.
\[ \text{Length} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{Height}} = \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

Thus, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed on average per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches climbed in the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in the week to find the average.

First, we know that Felix made $105 in a week. Since he charges $0.25 per branch, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total earnings by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \]

So, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is 60.

"To find the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase, we need to calculate the total number of petals Rose picked and then subtract the petals from the flowers she dropped.

1. First, calculate the total number of petals from the flowers she initially picked:
   - 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals
   - 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals
   - 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals
   - 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

2. Add these together to get the total number of petals before any flowers were dropped:
   \(15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\) petals

3. Since she dropped 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract the petals from one of each type of flower:

   - They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.
   - Number of quarters Jack uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \).

2. **Two Friends (Worse Players):**
   - Each of these friends can play for 10 minutes per quarter (half of Jack's 20 minutes).
   - Number of quarters each worse friend uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters} \).
   - Since there are two worse friends, total quarters used by both: \( 24 \text{ quarters} \times 2 = 48 \text{ quarters} \).

3. **One Friend (Better Player):**
   - This friend can play for 30 minutes per quarter (1.5 times Jack's 20 minutes).
   - Number of quarters the better friend uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \).

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables for the amounts of each ingredient Tanya uses in ounces:
- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest.
- Let \( f \) be the amount of fragrance.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt.
- Let \( g \) be the amount of sugar.
- Let \( o \) be the amount of oil.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( z = f \) (same amount of citrus zest as fragrance)
2. \( s = g \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
3. \( o = 2s \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( s = 2z \) (twice as much salt as zest)

We also know that the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces:
\[ z + f + s + g + o = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation:
\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 2s + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]

Since \( s = 2z \), substitute \( s \) in the equation:
\[ 2z + 4(2z) = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 8z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, find \( s \):
\[ s = 2z = 2(1) = 2 \]

Finally, find \( o \):
\[ o = 2s = 2(2) = 4 \]

So, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( B \) represent the number of cards Becca has.
2. Let \( S \) represent the number of cards Smendrick has.
3. Let \( P \) represent the number of cards PJ has.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( B + S + P = 341 \) (total number of cards)
2. \( B = S + 12 \) (Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick)
3. \( S = 3P \) (Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards PJ has)

First, we can substitute \( S \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ B = 3P + 12 \]

Next, we substitute \( B \) and \( S \) into the first equation:
\[ (3P + 12) + 3P + P = 341 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find \( S \) using \( S = 3P \):
\[ S = 3 \times 47 = 141 \]

Finally, we can find \( B \) using \( B = S + 12 \):
\[ B = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, Becca has 153 cards.

2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs. Since she had 5 green eggs, she had \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.
3. She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs. Since she had 10 blue eggs, she had \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. Since she had 9 pink eggs, she had \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs:
- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

Total number of eggs = \(5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27\)

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book and the amount she will be refunded by Amazon.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The shipping cost per pound is $0.35, and the book weighs 4 pounds.
     \[
     \text{Cost per pound} = 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40
     \]
   - The shipping cost per mile is $0.08, and the distance is 20 miles.
     \[
     \text{Cost per mile} = 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60
     \]
   - Total shipping cost:
     \[
     \text{Total shipping cost} = \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00
     \]

2. **Calculate the refund amount:**
   - The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.
     \[
     \text{Refund amount} = \$32 \times 0.75 = \$24.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the total loss:**
   - Milly's total loss is the original cost of the book minus the refund amount plus the shipping cost.
     \[
     \text{Total loss} = \$32.00 - \$24.00 + \$3.00 = \$11.00
     \]

Milly will lose $11.00."

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Anthony has.
2. Use the information about Roy's savings to find out how much he has.

First, we know that Eva has saved $20.00. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so:
\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Next, Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings:
\[ 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \]

So, Roy's total savings are:
\[ \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 12 = 30 + 12 = 42 \]

Therefore, Roy has $42.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the height Naruto can lift a mountain based on the given ratios and the height Pompei can lift a mountain.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei:
   \[
   \text{Height Saskay can lift} = 12 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay:
   \[
   \text{Height Kagiyami can lift} = 4 \times 12 \text{ inches} = 48 \text{ inches}
   \]
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami:
   \[
   \text{Height Naruto can lift} = 10 \times 48 \text{ inches} = 480 \text{ inches}
   \]

Now, we need to convert the height from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot:
\[
\text{Height Naruto can lift in feet} = \frac{480 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 40 \text{ feet}

"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance for each part of his journey and then add them together. The formula to calculate distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the first part of the journey:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

For the second part of the journey:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding these distances together gives the total distance:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the kangaroos and then use that information to find out how long it will take the turtles to travel the same distance.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - Let the distance across the highway be \( D \) miles.
   - Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( S \) miles per hour.
   - Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel the distance \( D \), the total distance covered by 3 kangaroos in 18 hours is \( 3 \times S \times 18 \) miles.
   - However, since they are traveling the same distance \( D \), we have:
     \[
     3 \times S \times 18 = D
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     54S = D
     \]
   - Therefore, the speed of one kangaroo is:
     \[
     S = \frac{D}{54}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is:
     \[
     \frac{S}{2} = \frac{D}{108}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - The total speed of 4 turtles is:
     \[
     4 \times \frac{D}{108} = \frac{4D}{108} = \frac{D}{27}
     \]
   - The time \( T \) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \( D \) is given by:
     \[
     T = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{27}} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

"Let's denote the number of clay dishes made by Kora as \( K \), by Rory as \( R \), and by Jada as \( J \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Kora made 20 dishes, so \( K = 20 \).
2. Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so \( R = K + 20 \).
3. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so \( J = 2R \).

First, we calculate the number of dishes Rory made:
\[ R = K + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the number of dishes Jada made:
\[ J = 2R = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Now, we find the total number of dishes made by all three:
\[ \text{Total} = K + R + J = 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 \]

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after all contributions and then subtract the cost of the laptop after the trade-in.

1. The original cost of the laptop is $600.
2. The trade-in reduces the price by $200, so the new cost is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she has $400 - $50 = $350.
4. She has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom gives her $80, so the total from these sources is $150 + $80 = $230.
5. The amount in her purse is the total she has minus the contributions from her job and her mom: $350 - $230 = $120.

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To find out how many apple slices are left, we first need to calculate the total number of slices Adam gets from slicing the apples. 

From the large apples:
3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices

From the small apples:
5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices

Adding these together gives the total number of slices:
15 slices (from large apples) + 15 slices (from small apples) = 30 slices

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first calculate the total milk production with the current number of cows. The farmer has 3 cows, and each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day. Therefore, the total milk production is:

\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional amount of milk needed is:

\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows required is:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we first need to add the fractions of the glue sticks that are left and then multiply by the original length of a glue stick.

The fractions of the glue sticks that are left are:
- 1/6
- 2/3
- 1/2

First, we add these fractions together. To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common denominator (LCD) for 6, 3, and 2 is 6.

Convert each fraction to have a denominator of 6:
- 1/6 remains 1/6
- 2/3 is equivalent to 4/6 (since 2 * 2 = 4 and 3 * 2 = 6)
- 1/2 is equivalent to 3/6 (since 1 * 3 = 3 and 2 * 3 = 6)

Now, add the fractions:
1/6 + 4/6 + 3/6 = (1 + 4 + 3) / 6 = 8/6

Simplify 8/6:
8/6 = 4/3

Now, we need to find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used. Each glue stick is originally 12 millimeters long. Multiply the total fraction of the glue sticks that are left by the original length:

4/3 * 12 = (4 * 12) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so if Jack has 60 dishes, he must have \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
- Total socks: \( 30 \) (Jack) + \( 60 \) (Peter) = \( 90 \)
- Total dishes: \( 60 \) (Jack) + \( 30 \) (Peter) = \( 90 \)

Next, we calculate the total time required for each group to perform, including the time to get on stage, perform, and exit the stage:
2 minutes (on stage) + 6 minutes (performance) + 2 minutes (exit) = 10 minutes per group.

Now, we divide the total available time by the time required per group:
110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups.

Therefore, Vicki can have 11 groups perform in the concert.

"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we first need to determine the interest earned each year and then add it to the principal amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which means:
Interest per year = 3/4 * $300 = $225

Since the interest is simple, it does not compound, and the same amount of interest is earned each year. Over 3 years, the total interest earned will be:
Total interest = $225 * 3 = $675

Adding this total interest to the original principal amount gives us the total amount after 3 years:
Total amount = Principal + Total interest = $300 + $675 = $975

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Claire's Badge Earnings:**
   - Claire earns 1 badge every month.
   - In 1 year (12 months), Claire earns \( 1 \times 12 = 12 \) badges.

2. **Amber's Badge Earnings:**
   - Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire.
   - Therefore, Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months.
   - In 1 year (12 months), Amber earns \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) badges.

3. **Wendy's Badge Earnings:**
   - Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.
   - In 1 year, Wendy earns \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) badges.

4. **Difference in Badge Earnings:**
   - We need to find how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber.
   - Wendy earns 36 badges, and Amber earns 6 badges.
   - The difference is \( 36 - 6 = 30 \) badges.

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame.

"To determine how much Paige raised, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Paige baked.
2. Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked.
3. Calculate the total number of slices from the loaves.
4. Calculate the total amount raised by selling all the slices.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Paige baked.**
Paige baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours.

**Step 2: Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked.**
Paige can bake 2 loaves per hour. Over 5 hours, she baked:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of slices from the loaves.**
Each loaf is cut into 8 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total amount raised by selling all the slices.**
Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. Therefore, the total amount raised is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount raised is:
\[ 40 \]

"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of burritos given to the students.
2. Add the number of burritos Mr. George ate.
3. Subtract the total number of burritos given to the students and Mr. George from the original number of burritos ordered.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of burritos given to the students.
- There are 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos.
- Total burritos given to students = 50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos

Step 2: Add the number of burritos Mr. George ate.
- Mr. George ate 20 burritos.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of burritos used.
- Total burritos used = 500 burritos (students) + 20 burritos (Mr. George) = 520 burritos

Step 4: Subtract the total number of burritos used from the original number of burritos ordered.
- Original number of burritos ordered = 600 burritos
- Total number of leftover burritos = 600 burritos - 520 burritos = 80 burritos

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The rink has 12 red cars.
2. The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars.
3. The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars.
4. The total number of cars is 75.

First, calculate the number of green cars:
- Number of green cars = Number of red cars - 2
- Number of green cars = 12 - 2 = 10

Next, calculate the number of blue cars:
- Number of blue cars = 3 × Number of green cars
- Number of blue cars = 3 × 10 = 30

Now, we know the number of red, green, and blue cars:
- Red cars = 12
- Green cars = 10
- Blue cars = 30

Let \( y \) be the number of yellow cars. The total number of cars is the sum of all the cars:
- Total cars = Red cars + Green cars + Blue cars + Yellow cars
- 75 = 12 + 10 + 30 + \( y \)

Solve for \( y \):
- 75 = 52 + \( y \)
- \( y \) = 75 - 52
- \( y \) = 23

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( S \) represent the number of books Sofie has.
2. Let \( A \) represent the number of books Anne has.
3. Let \( F \) represent the number of books Fawn has.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (Total number of books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (A + 25) + A + F = 85 \]
\[ 2A + 25 + F = 85 \]
\[ 2A + F = 60 \]

Next, we substitute the third equation into the equation \( 2A + F = 60 \):
\[ 2(F - 12) + F = 60 \]
\[ 2F - 24 + F = 60 \]
\[ 3F - 24 = 60 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To solve this, we first determine the speed of the thingamabob. Since a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob and a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can set up the following proportion:

\[ \text{Speed of whatchamacallit} = 11 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} \]

Given that the speed of the whatchamacallit is 121 meters per second, we can solve for the speed of the thingamabob:

\[ 121 = 11 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} \]
\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

Next, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the whirligig is:

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information provided.

Let's define:
- \( J \) as the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
- \( K \) as the number of times Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn.
- \( A \) as the number of times Tasha mowed Alba's lawn.
- \( L \) as the amount of money Tasha made from lemonade sales.

From the problem, we know:
1. Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's: \( K = 3J \).
2. Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's: \( A = 5J \).
3. Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work: \( 6J \).
4. Tasha made a total of $80 from all her activities: \( 6J + L = 80 \).

We need to find \( L \), the amount of money Tasha made from lemonade sales.

First, substitute \( K \) and \( A \) in terms of \( J \) into the total earnings equation:
\[ 6J + L = 80 \]

Since \( J \) is the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn, and we know Joe paid $6 for each time, we can solve for \( J \):
\[ 6J + L = 80 \]

To find \( J \), we need to determine how many times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn. However, the problem does not provide a direct number for \( J \). Instead, we can use the total earnings equation to solve for \( L \).

Since \( J \) is the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn, and she made $6 for each time, we can express \( L \) as:
\[ L = 80 - 6J \]

To find \( J \), we need to use the information that Tasha mowed Kamala's and Alba's lawns in terms of \( J \). However, the problem does not provide a direct number for \( J \). We can assume \( J \) is a positive integer and solve for \( L \).

Let's assume \( J = 1 \) (the smallest positive integer):
\[ 6(1) + L = 80 \]
\[ 6 + L = 80 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bowls of soup are left after Calvin and his family have eaten dinner.

1. The pot contains enough soup to fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.
2. Calvin and his wife are adults, so they will each have 1 adult bowl.
3. Each of the two children will have 1 child bowl.

First, we convert the adult bowls to child bowls to make the calculations easier:
- 1 adult bowl = 2 child bowls (since 4 adult bowls = 8 child bowls, 1 adult bowl = 8/4 = 2 child bowls).

So, Calvin and his wife together will consume:
- 2 adult bowls = 2 * 2 = 4 child bowls.

The two children will consume:
- 2 child bowls.

Total consumption for dinner:
- 4 child bowls (adults) + 2 child bowls (children) = 6 child bowls.

The pot originally contains 8 child bowls. After dinner, the remaining soup is:
- 8 child bowls - 6 child bowls = 2 child bowls.

Each child will be able to have:
- 2 child bowls / 2 children = 1 bowl per child.

Thus, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

"To solve this problem, let's set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( D \) represent Duncan's current age and \( A \) represent Adam's current age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago.
2. Duncan's current age is 60.

First, express Duncan's age eight years ago:
\[ D - 8 \]

Next, express Adam's age four years ago:
\[ A - 4 \]

According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago:
\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

We also know that Duncan's current age \( D \) is 60:
\[ D = 60 \]

Substitute \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ 26 = A - 4 \]

Add 4 to both sides to solve for \( A \):
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, add 8 to his current age:
\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given.

Let:
- \( r \) be the number of red balloons.
- \( y \) be the number of yellow balloons.

From the problem, we know:
1. Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
2. Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
3. Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
4. There are 20 red balloons.

We can write the following equations based on this information:
1. \( 2r + 3y = 58 \) (total pieces of bologna)
2. \( r = 20 \) (number of red balloons)

Substitute \( r = 20 \) into the first equation:
\[ 2(20) + 3y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3y = 58 \]

Subtract 40 from both sides:
\[ 3y = 18 \]

   \]

3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = L + J
   \]

First, substitute \( L \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute \( L \) and \( P \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]
\[
4J = 80
\]
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[
L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, Peter's age is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"To find the total number of water balloons, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Maria invited 4 friends, so there are 5 people in total (Maria + 4 friends).
2. At the start, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons:
   - 4 friends × 2 balloons each = 8 balloons.
3. Maria had 1 water balloon for herself:
   - 1 balloon.
4. So, at the start, the total number of balloons is:
   - 8 (friends' balloons) + 1 (Maria's balloon) = 9 balloons.
5. Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons:
   - 5 people × 3 balloons each = 15 balloons.
6. Adding the balloons given by Maria's mom to the initial total:
   - 9 (initial balloons) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24 balloons.

Therefore, the total number of balloons the girls had is 24.

"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated by the 10 people. Each person donates 5 boxes, so:
10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes

Next, we add the 10 boxes of stuff they already have:
50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes

Now, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all 60 boxes, given that 2 boxes fit per table:
60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

They already own 15 tables, so the number of new tables needed is:
30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

"To find the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney, we first need to calculate the total distance each of them spits their seeds.

For Zoey:
- Number of seeds: 40
- Distance per seed: 10 feet
- Total distance: \( 40 \times 10 = 400 \) feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds: 35
- Distance per seed: 12 feet
- Total distance: \( 35 \times 12 = 420 \) feet

Next, we find the total distance for both:
- Total distance for both: \( 400 + 420 = 820 \) feet

Finally, we calculate the average total distance:
- Average total distance: \( \frac{820}{2} = 410 \) feet

"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total earnings from each machine over a month and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate the hourly production for each machine:**
   - Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour
   - WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour

2. **Calculate the daily production for each machine:**
   - Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1440 widgets/day
   - WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1080 widgets/day

3. **Calculate the monthly production for each machine:**
   - Widgeteer 3000: 1440 widgets/day * 30 days = 43200 widgets/month
   - WidgetMaster 9000: 1080 widgets/day * 30 days = 32400 widgets/month

4. **Calculate the monthly earnings for each machine:**
   - Widgeteer 3000: 43200 widgets * $6/widget = $259200
   - WidgetMaster 9000: 32400 widgets * $6/widget = $194400

"Cameron arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos. The additional 5 hours (17 - 12) cost 70 pesos per hour.

The cost for the additional hours is:
5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

The total cost for Cameron's stay is:
1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos

If Cameron had chosen the 24-hour stay, it would have cost 1600 pesos. The savings by choosing the 12-hour stay plus the additional hours is:
1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs, we first calculate the amount of hay each type of livestock requires.

1. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.
2. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, twice that amount is 10 pounds. Therefore, each sheep needs 10 - 3 = 7 pounds of hay.

Next, we calculate the total hay needed for the goats and the sheep:

1. For the goats: 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds of hay.
2. For the sheep: 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds of hay.

Finally, we add the amounts of hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay required:

75 pounds (for goats) + 84 pounds (for sheep) = 159 pounds of hay.

"First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the amount he spends on gas:
\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we subtract the amount he wants to deposit in the bank:
\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the 5 pencils:
\[ 5 \text{ pencils} \times 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we determine how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with the remaining money:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ dollars}}{25 \text{ dollars/pen}} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

"To solve this problem, we first calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled out. Craig has spelled out 20 words, each with 15 letters. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig has spelled is:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Next, we know that Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled is:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the total number of letters Craig has spelled to the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

"To find the total number of children in the drill, we need to multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows, and then multiply that by the number of schools. 

The number of children in each row is 8. 
The number of rows is 7. 
The number of schools is 5.

So, the total number of children is \(8 \times 7 \times 5\).

Calculating this, we get:
\(8 \times 7 = 56\)
\(56 \times 5 = 280\)

Therefore, the total number of children in the drill is 280.

"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher gets from redeeming all her coupons. Since each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles and she has 9 coupons:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice are given to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles to find out how many bottles the teacher has left:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself.

"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing service, we need to consider the fixed visit fee, the labor cost, and the cost of parts.

1. **Visit Fee**: $40
2. **Labor Cost**: $35 per hour for 2.25 hours. Since the charge is per hour or part thereof, we round 2.25 hours up to 3 hours.
   - Labor cost = 3 hours * $35/hour = $105
3. **Parts Cost**: $60

Now, we add these costs together:
- Total charge = Visit Fee + Labor Cost + Parts Cost
- Total charge = $40 + $105 + $60 = $205

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs after the 40% discount.

The original cost of each CD is $15. With a 40% discount, the discount amount per CD is:
\[ 15 \times 0.40 = 6 \]

So, the cost per CD after the discount is:
\[ 15 - 6 = 9 \]

The total cost for 10 CDs is:
\[ 10 \times 9 = 90 \]

Next, James sells 5 of the CDs for $40. The total amount he receives from selling these 5 CDs is:
\[ 5 \times 40 = 200 \]

However, this seems incorrect because the selling price per CD should be a single value, not a total. Let's assume he sells each of the 5 CDs for $40 in total, which means:
\[ \text{Selling price per CD} = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

The total amount he receives from selling the 5 CDs is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Now, we calculate the net amount James was out:
\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

So, the final amount of money James was out is:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.

2. **Calculate the time it takes for the initial swim:**
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time for the initial swim: \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \) hours.

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   - James rests for half as long as the initial swim time.
   - Rest time: \( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   - The total distance is 20 miles, and he has already swum 12 miles.
   - Remaining distance: \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   - James swims the remaining distance at half his initial speed.
   - New speed: \( \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \) mile per hour.

6. **Calculate the time for the remaining swim:**
   - Time for the remaining swim: \( \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \) hours.

7. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Total time = Time for initial swim + Rest time + Time for remaining swim
   - Total time: \( 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \) hours.

The total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours.

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The total points scored by the team is 45:
   \[
   B + A + D = 45
   \]

2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo:
   \[
   B = A + 20
   \]

3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar:
   \[
   B = D + 10
   \]

We can use these equations to solve for \( A \), \( B \), and \( D \).

First, substitute \( B = A + 20 \) into the equation \( B = D + 10 \):
\[
A + 20 = D + 10
\]
Solving for \( D \):
\[
D = A + 10
\]

Now, substitute \( B = A + 20 \) and \( D = A + 10 \) into the total points equation:
\[
(A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45
\]
Simplify and solve for \( A \):
\[
3A + 30 = 45

\[
3A = 15
\]
\[
A = 5

"To determine the total number of pages in the book, we need to consider the thickness of the book and the number of pages per inch. Given that the book is 1.5 inches thick and there are 100 pages per inch, we can calculate the total number of pages as follows:

1. Calculate the total number of pages per inch:
   - 100 pages per inch

2. Multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book in inches:
   - 100 pages/inch * 1.5 inches = 150 pages

Since each sheet of paper is printed on both sides, each sheet contributes 2 pages to the total page count. However, the given information already accounts for this, as the 100 pages per inch is based on the total number of printed pages, not sheets.

Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is:

"To determine how many reports Vince can staple from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, we first need to calculate the total time he spent stapling and then use his stapling rate to find the total number of reports.

1. Calculate the total time from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM:
   - From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.
   - Convert 15 hours to minutes: \(15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes}\).

2. Determine Vince's stapling rate:
   - Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes.
   - Calculate the number of 15-minute intervals in 900 minutes: \(900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals}\).

3. Calculate the total number of reports stapled:
   - Multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval: \(60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports}\).

1. Let \( A \) represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
2. Let \( S \) represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
3. Let \( W \) represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( A + S + W = 339 \) (Total Pokemon caught)
2. \( A = S + 5 \) (Alex has caught 5 more than Stan)

\[ 2S + W + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + W = 334 \]

Next, we substitute \( S \) from the third equation into the equation \( 2S + W = 334 \):
\[ 2(4W - 13) + W = 334 \]
\[ 8W - 26 + W = 334 \]
\[ 9W - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9W = 360 \]
\[ W = 40 \]

Now that we have \( W \), we can find \( S \) using the third equation:
\[ S = 4W - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of episodes and then calculate the total time spent watching all episodes.

1. Each episode is 20 minutes long.
2. The number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, the number of episodes is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).

Now, we calculate the total time spent watching all episodes:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Number of episodes} \times \text{Minutes per episode} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \]

So, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show.

"To calculate the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to consider the distances traveled in each direction and then sum the net distance traveled southward.

1. **First leg of the journey (southward):**
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second leg of the journey (northward):**
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third leg of the journey (southward):**
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled southward by subtracting the distance traveled northward from the total distance traveled southward:

- Total distance southward: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \)
- Distance traveled northward: \( 36 \text{ miles} \)

Net distance southward: \( 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \)

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.

"To find out how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of brownies Greta had initially.
2. Subtract the number of brownies eaten during the party.

First, let's convert all quantities to the same unit (individual brownies). There are 12 brownies in a dozen.

- Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies: \(1 \times 12 = 12\) brownies.
- She brought home 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office: \(0.5 \times 12 = 6\) brownies.
- Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies to the surprise party: \(4 \times 12 = 48\) brownies.

Now, let's add these together to find the total number of brownies Greta had initially:
\[ 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \text{ brownies} \]

Next, we need to account for the brownies eaten during the party:
- 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten: \(1.5 \times 12 = 18\) brownies.

Subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies:
\[ 66 - 18 = 48 \text{ brownies} \]

So, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:

"To find the total number of players in both teams, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

Number of players on Zeke's team = Number of players on Carlton's team + 7
Number of players on Zeke's team = 13 + 7
Number of players on Zeke's team = 20

Next, we add the number of players on both teams to find the total number of players:

Total number of players = Number of players on Carlton's team + Number of players on Zeke's team
Total number of players = 13 + 20
Total number of players = 33

"First, let's determine how many boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington has after giving some to her mom and sister. She initially bought 12 boxes and gave away 2 boxes each to her mom and sister, which totals 4 boxes.

12 boxes - 4 boxes = 8 boxes

Next, we need to find out how many boxes she kept and how many she sold. She kept 1/4 of the remaining 8 boxes.

1/4 of 8 boxes = 2 boxes

So, she kept 2 boxes and sold the rest. The number of boxes she sold is:

8 boxes - 2 boxes = 6 boxes

Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges she sold is:

6 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 120 oranges

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. Adding these together:

\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

So, the total cost of the books is $39. Tyler has already saved $14. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost:

\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler needs an additional $25. Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can find out how many hours he needs to work by dividing the amount he needs by his hourly wage:

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books.

"Let's define the number of cherries each person has:
- Let \( R \) be the number of cherries Robert has.
- Let \( J \) be the number of cherries Jerry has.
- Let \( C \) be the number of cherries Richard has.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( R = 30 \)
2. \( R = C + 10 \)
3. The total number of cherries is 60, so \( R + J + C = 60 \)

First, substitute \( R = 30 \) into the second equation:
\[ 30 = C + 10 \]
\[ C = 30 - 10 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now, substitute \( R = 30 \) and \( C = 20 \) into the third equation:
\[ 30 + J + 20 = 60 \]
\[ 50 + J = 60 \]
\[ J = 60 - 50 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

Now, we need to find how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:
\[ R - J = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

- Let \( A_s \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday.
- Let \( G_u \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday.
- Let \( A_u \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday.

From the problem, we know:
1. On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread:
   \[
   G_s = 10
   \]
2. On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday:
   \[
   A_s = A_u - 4
   \]
3. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday:
   \[
   G_u = G_s + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15
   \]
4. On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie:
   \[
   A_u = 15
   \]

Now, we can find \( A_s \):
\[
A_s = A_u - 4 = 15 - 4 = 11
\]

Next, we calculate the total earnings for each day:
- Earnings from gingerbread on Saturday:
  \[
  10 \text{ boxes} \times \$6/\text{box} = \$60
  \]
- Earnings from apple pie on Saturday:
  \[
  11 \text{ boxes} \times \$15/\text{box} = \$165

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define the variables:
- \( E \) = Emil's current age (19 years)
- \( D \) = Dad's current age
- \( B \) = Brother's current age

From the problem, we know:
1. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

First, let's determine how many years it will take for Emil to turn 24:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ years} \]

So, in 5 years:
- Emil will be 24 years old.
- Dad will be \( D + 5 \) years old.
- Brother will be \( B + 5 \) years old.

Using the information given:
1. When Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
\[ D = 43 \]

2. When Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother:
\[ 24 = 2 (B + 5) \]
\[ 24 = 2B + 10 \]
\[ 14 = 2B \]
\[ B = 7 \]

Now, we have the current ages:
- Dad's current age \( D = 43 \)
- Brother's current age \( B = 7 \)

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now is:
\[ D + B = 43 + 7 = 50 \]

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet:**
   - Each flower grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot.

2. **Calculate the total space each plant, including the space between plants, will occupy:**
   - Each plant needs 1.5 feet of space between it and the next plant.
   - Therefore, each plant, including the space between plants, will occupy 1 foot (plant) + 1.5 feet (space) = 2.5 feet.

3. **Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - The number of plants that can fit is 111 feet / 2.5 feet per plant = 44.4 plants.
   - Since Pat can't plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 plants.
   - The number of additional plants needed is 44 plants - 17 plants = 27 plants.

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**

"Let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar: \( A = 3 \)
- Alessandro: \( L = 4 \)
- Helene: \( H \)
- Wilfred: \( W \)

We are given that the total age of the children is 20:
\[ A + L + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values of \( A \) and \( L \):
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

We are also given that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + L + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Therefore, Helene's age \( H \) is:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Thus, the age of Wilfred is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the total number of parts the watermelon is divided into. If each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can represent the size of each kid's slice as 1 part. Therefore, each adult's slice would be 2 parts.

Since there are 4 kids, the total parts for the kids would be:
4 kids * 1 part/kid = 4 parts

Since there are 2 adults, the total parts for the adults would be:
2 adults * 2 parts/adult = 4 parts

The total number of parts the watermelon is divided into is:
4 parts (kids) + 4 parts (adults) = 8 parts

Each adult gets 2 parts out of the total 8 parts. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we calculate:
(2 parts / 8 parts) * 100% = 25%

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the costs and the revenue. However, the question does not specify the revenue (i.e., how much the studio charges per student per session). Assuming the question is asking for the total cost incurred by the studio in a month, we can proceed as follows:

1. Calculate the cost of renting the studio per session:
   - Cost per session = $25

2. Calculate the cost per student per session:
   - Cost per student per session = $1.50

3. Calculate the total cost per session for 10 students:
   - Total cost per session for students = 10 students * $1.50 = $15

4. Calculate the total cost per session (studio rental + student costs):
   - Total cost per session = $25 + $15 = $40

5. Calculate the total cost per week (3 sessions per week):
   - Total cost per week = 3 sessions * $40 = $120

6. Calculate the total cost per month (assuming 4 weeks in a month):
   - Total cost per month = 4 weeks * $120 = $480

The expected cost for the dance studio in a month is $480. 

If you need the expected earnings, please provide the revenue per student per session.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes and then find the difference.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( p \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( m \).

From the problem, we know:
- Peter has 4 boxes, and the total number of chocolate bars is 64. This gives us the equation:
  \[
  4p = 64
  \]
- Martha has 7 boxes, and the total number of chocolate bars is 56. This gives us the equation:
  \[
  7m = 56
  \]

First, solve for \( p \):
\[
4p = 64 \implies p = \frac{64}{4} = 16
\]

Next, solve for \( m \):
\[
7m = 56 \implies m = \frac{56}{7} = 8
\]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:
\[
p - m = 16 - 8 = 8
\]

Thus, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons.

Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.
The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 25 \, \text{ft} \times 14 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \]
\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Step 2: Convert the volume to gallons.

"First, calculate the total earnings from the cookies and cupcakes. Suzanne sold 80 cookies at $1 each, so the earnings from cookies are:
\[ 80 \times 1 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, she sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, so the earnings from cupcakes are:
\[ 60 \times 4 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total earnings:
\[ 80 + 240 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so the total amount given to her sisters is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting this from her total earnings gives the amount of money she has left:
\[ 320 - 20 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe in one day.
2. Calculate the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves in one day.
3. Calculate the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves in 30 days.

**Step 1: Determine the amount of ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe in one day.**

- A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
- With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much: \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) pounds per day.
- With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe: \( 24 + 0.5 \times 24 = 24 + 12 = 36 \) pounds per day.

**Step 2: Calculate the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves in one day.**

- If one dwarf can mine 36 pounds per day, 40 dwarves can mine: \( 40 \times 36 = 1440 \) pounds per day.

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves in 30 days.**

- If 40 dwarves can mine 1440 pounds per day, in 30 days they can mine: \( 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \) pounds.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches based on the given proportional relationship. We can start by finding the unit price for the first two packages and then use that to find the cost of the third package.

1. For the first package:
   - 2 sandwiches for $3
   - Unit price = $3 / 2 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich

2. For the second package:
   - 4 sandwiches for $6
   - Unit price = $6 / 4 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich

Since the unit price is the same for both packages, we can use this unit price to find the cost of the third package.

3. For the third package:
   - 8 sandwiches
   - Cost = 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.

"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst due to the wind. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst:

40% of 25 = 0.40 * 25 = 10 red balloons burst.

So, the number of red balloons remaining is:
25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. She initially had 12 yellow balloons:

Half of 12 = 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons released.

So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:
12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her clutch:

75% of 8 = 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons added.

Now, let's sum up all the balloons Sally carried into the school:
- Red balloons: 15
- Green balloons: 7 (unchanged)
- Yellow balloons: 6
- Blue balloons: 6

Total balloons = 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34

"To determine the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the different scenarios and their probabilities:

1. **Substitute Teacher (50% chance)**:
   - If there is a substitute teacher, the homework will not be collected. Therefore, the probability that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework in this case is 100%.

2. **Normal Teacher (50% chance)**:
   - If the normal teacher is present, there are two further scenarios to consider:
     - **Extension for the whole class (40% chance)**:
       - If the whole class gets an extension, Marcus will not have to turn in his homework. The probability of this happening is 40%.
     - **No extension for the whole class (60% chance)**:
       - If there is no extension for the whole class, Marcus has a 20% chance of convincing the teacher that his dog ate his assignment and getting a personal extension. The probability of this happening is 20%.
       - If Marcus does not get a personal extension, he will have to turn in his homework. The probability of this happening is 80%.

Now, we can calculate the overall probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

- **Probability of substitute teacher and not having to turn in homework**:
  \[
  P(\text{Substitute}) \times P(\text{No homework}) = 0.5 \times 1 = 0.5
  \]

- **Probability of normal teacher and not having to turn in homework**:
  \[
  P(\text{Normal teacher}) \times P(\text{Extension for class}) + P(\text{Normal teacher}) \times P(\text{No extension for class}) \times P(\text{Personal extension})
  \]
  \[
  = 0.5 \times 0.4 + 0.5 \times 0.6 \times 0.2
  \]
  \[
  = 0.2 + 0.06 = 0.26
  \]

- **Total probability of not having to turn in homework**:
  \[
  P(\text{Substitute}) + P(\text{Normal teacher and no homework}) = 0.5 + 0.26 = 0.76
  \]

- **Probability of having to turn in homework**:
  \[
  1 - P(\text{No homework}) = 1 - 0.76 = 0.24
  \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

"To determine how many tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family, we first need to calculate the total number of seats available for guests. We start by subtracting the seats allocated for graduates and faculty from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center: 6000 seats
Seats for graduates: 950 seats
Seats for faculty: 300 seats

Total seats for guests = Total capacity - Seats for graduates - Seats for faculty
Total seats for guests = 6000 - 950 - 300
Total seats for guests = 4750 seats

Next, we need to divide the total number of guest seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive.

Number of graduates: 950

Tickets per graduate = Total seats for guests / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5

Each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat based on the given information about the sizes and quantities of jelly beans.

1. **Determine the number of medium-sized jelly beans Grandpa can eat:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
   - Since he can eat 75 large jelly beans, he can eat \( 2 \times 75 = 150 \) medium-sized jelly beans.

2. **Determine the number of small jelly beans equivalent to one medium-sized jelly bean:**
   - Eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean.
   - Therefore, 1 medium-sized bean is equivalent to 3 small beans.

3. **Calculate the total number of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat:**
   - Since Grandpa can eat 150 medium-sized jelly beans, and each medium-sized jelly bean is equivalent to 3 small beans, the total number of small jelly beans he can eat is \( 150 \times 3 = 450 \).

Thus, Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans.

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of soda bottles Richard will place along the driveway.
2. Determine the total time it takes for Richard to move from the first bottle to the last bottle, dropping the candy in each bottle.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of soda bottles.**

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard places a bottle every 3 feet. To find the number of bottles, we divide the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:
\[ \text{Number of bottles} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total time to move from the first bottle to the last bottle.**

Richard starts at the first bottle and moves to the next bottle, taking 5 seconds for each move. Since there are 8 bottles, he will move from one bottle to the next 7 times (from the 1st to the 2nd, 2nd to the 3rd, and so on, up to the 7th to the 8th).

The total time to move from the first bottle to the last bottle is:
\[ \text{Total time} = 7 \text{ moves} \times 5 \text{ seconds per move} = 35 \text{ seconds} \]

Thus, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:
\[ 35 \text{ seconds} \]

"To determine how long it will take Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we need to calculate the total cost of his education and the opportunity cost of not working, and then compare this to his new income.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the loans:**
   - Jim takes out $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.
   - Total loans = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000

2. **Calculate the opportunity cost of not working:**
   - Jim could have earned $25,000 per year if he had not gone to college.
   - Total opportunity cost = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000

3. **Calculate the total cost of his education:**
   - Total cost = Total loans + Total opportunity cost
   - Total cost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

4. **Calculate Jim's new income:**
   - His college degree tripled his income.
   - New income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

5. **Calculate the net additional income per year:**
   - Net additional income = New income - Previous income
   - Net additional income = $75,000 - $25,000 = $50,000 per year

6. **Determine how long it will take to earn the total cost:**
   - Time to earn the total cost = Total cost / Net additional income
   - Time to earn the total cost = $300,000 / $50,000 = 6 years

Therefore, it will take Jim 6 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"To determine the total square feet of fabric Jim needs, we first calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces required. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each piece of fabric is:
6 feet (length of the bed) + 2 feet = 8 feet

And the width of each piece of fabric is:
8 feet (width of the bed) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
8 feet (length) * 10 feet (width) = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area required is:
80 square feet (area of one piece) * 2 = 160 square feet

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of letters delivered on Tuesday:**
   - On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.
   - On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday.
   - One-fifth of 425 is \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \).
   - Therefore, on Tuesday, they delivered \( 85 + 17 = 102 \) letters.

2. **Determine the number of letters delivered on Wednesday:**
   - On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.
   - Twice as many as 102 is \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \).
   - Therefore, on Wednesday, they delivered \( 204 + 5 = 209 \) letters.

3. **Calculate the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:**
   - Total letters = Letters on Monday + Letters on Tuesday + Letters on Wednesday
   - Total letters = 425 + 102 + 209

Now, let's add these numbers together:

"To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.

1. On the first race, he lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 on the first race, twice that amount is $10, and $1 more than that is $11.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11 in the second race, 1.5 times that amount is $16.50.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- First race loss: $5
- Second race win: $11 (this reduces the total loss)
- Third race loss: $16.50

Total loss = First race loss - Second race win + Third race loss
Total loss = $5 - $11 + $16.50
Total loss = $11.50

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races:
Average loss = Total loss / Number of races
Average loss = $11.50 / 3
Average loss = $3.83

- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:

\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

First, combine like terms:

\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:

\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we know the number of balls retrieved in the second set is 6. To find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

1. **Weekly Loads Calculation:**
   - Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed.
   - The laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets per load and 1 king set of sheets per load.
   - For the twin beds: 4 twin sets / 2 twin sets per load = 2 loads.
   - For the king size bed: 1 king set / 1 king set per load = 1 load.
   - Total weekly loads = 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads.

2. **Annual Loads Calculation:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Total annual loads = 3 loads per week * 52 weeks = 156 loads.

"To find out how many movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, let's break down the problem:

1. On Saturdays, they watch 4 movies.
2. On Sundays, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturdays, which is \(4 / 2 = 2\) movies.

So, in one weekend, they watch:
\[ 4 \text{ (Saturday)} + 2 \text{ (Sunday)} = 6 \text{ movies} \]

Since they watch movies every weekend, in 4 weeks, they will watch:
\[ 6 \text{ movies/weekend} \times 4 \text{ weekends} = 24 \text{ movies} \]

"To find out how many stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to add the stickers he had two years ago, the stickers he collected last year, and the stickers he collected this year.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
Last year, he collected 50 more stickers.
This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as last year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Adding these together:

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to calculate the total amount of food consumed per day and then see how many days the total amount of food will last.

1. First, calculate the total amount of food consumed per feeding:
   - Each cat eats 60 grams per feeding.
   - There are 3 cats.
   - Total food per feeding = 60 grams/cat * 3 cats = 180 grams.

2. Since the cats are fed twice a day, calculate the total amount of food consumed per day:
   - Total food per day = 180 grams/feeding * 2 feedings/day = 360 grams/day.

3. Now, determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last:
   - Number of days = 720 grams / 360 grams/day = 2 days.

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of slices each person ate. Let \( J \) represent the number of slices Jake ate. According to the problem:

- Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so Becky ate \( J + 3 \) slices.
- Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \( 2J \) slices.
- Becky ate 10 slices, so \( J + 3 = 10 \).

First, solve for \( J \):
\[ J + 3 = 10 \]
\[ J = 10 - 3 \]
\[ J = 7 \]

Now, we know:
- Jake ate 7 slices.
- Becky ate 10 slices.
- Silvia ate \( 2J = 2 \times 7 = 14 \) slices.

Next, calculate the total number of slices they ate:
\[ \text{Total slices} = J + (J + 3) + 2J \]
\[ \text{Total slices} = 7 + 10 + 14 \]
\[ \text{Total slices} = 31 \]

Thus, the total number of slices they ate is 31.

"Let's denote the time Donovan spent on his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's part can be represented as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time spent on the meal is the sum of the time Betsy and Donovan each spent, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:
\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which is 18 minutes longer, is:
\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

Next, let's calculate how much Riza spent:
Riza spent one-third of her money. Since she also had $60:
\[ \text{Amount Riza spent} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]

So, the amount Riza has left is:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

Now, we add the amounts left for both Maggie and Riza:

"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bananas eaten by all monkeys in a week.
2. Determine the daily consumption of the first and second monkeys.
3. Subtract the daily consumption of the first and second monkeys from the total daily consumption to find the daily consumption of the third monkey.

Step 1: Total number of bananas eaten by all monkeys in a week is 315 bananas.

Step 2: The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

Step 3: The total daily consumption of bananas by all three monkeys is 315 bananas / 7 days = 45 bananas per day.

The first and second monkeys together eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas each day.

Therefore, the third monkey eats 45 - 24 = 21 bananas each day.

2. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend.
3. Determine the discount Mr. Rogers' friend received from the original price.
4. Convert this discount into a percentage of the original price.

Step 1: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.
The watch was sold at 75% of its original price.
Original price = $2000
Price Mr. Rogers paid = 75% of $2000 = 0.75 * $2000 = $1500

Step 2: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend.
Mr. Rogers sold the watch at 120% of the price he paid.
Price Mr. Rogers sold it for = 120% of $1500 = 1.20 * $1500 = $1800

Step 3: Determine the discount Mr. Rogers' friend received from the original price.
Discount = Original price - Price Mr. Rogers' friend paid
Discount = $2000 - $1800 = $200

Step 4: Convert this discount into a percentage of the original price.

"First, let's calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class during the week.

John has 6 normal periods each day, plus 2 extra classes, making it 8 classes per day. Each class is 40 minutes long.

\[ 8 \text{ classes/day} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he goes to class 5 days a week:

\[ 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends \( \frac{1}{16} \) of his weekly class time each day on these days.

The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. Therefore, after the first bounce, the height to which the ball rises is:

\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

After the second bounce, the ball will rise to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height it reached after the first bounce:

\[ 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is 32 feet.

"To find the height of the fourth child in inches, let's break down the information step by step:

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, the first child is:
   \[
   6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. The second child is two inches taller than the first child:
   \[
   72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child:
   \[
   74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child:
   \[
   69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is:

"To find out how much the orchard earned, we first need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag:

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

Therefore, the orchard earned $1000.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. This means that before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 kilograms of meat left.
2. The velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex. Therefore, the 270 kilograms is half of what was left after the T-Rex. So, before the velociraptors ate, there were \(270 \times 2 = 540\) kilograms of meat.
3. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. Therefore, the 540 kilograms is half of the original amount of meat on the triceratops. So, before the T-Rex ate, there were \(540 \times 2 = 1080\) kilograms of meat.

Thus, the triceratops originally had 1080 kilograms of meat.

"To determine the cost to paint the room, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

1. Calculate the area of the north and south walls:
   - Each wall is 10 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet.
   - Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls = 2 * 80 square feet = 160 square feet.

2. Calculate the area of the east and west walls:
   - Each wall is 5 feet wide and 8 feet high.
   - Area of one wall = 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet.
   - Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls = 2 * 40 square feet = 80 square feet.

3. Calculate the total area of all four walls:
   - Total area = 160 square feet (north and south) + 80 square feet (east and west) = 240 square feet.

4. Determine the number of gallons of paint needed:
   - One gallon of paint covers 20 square feet.
   - Number of gallons needed = Total area / Coverage per gallon = 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons.

5. Calculate the total cost of the paint:
   - Cost per gallon = $12.
   - Total cost = Number of gallons * Cost per gallon = 12 gallons * $12 = $144.

The total cost to paint the room is $144.

"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability that the friend picks a shaken can from the remaining sodas.

Initially, there are 12 sodas, 3 of which are shaken. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda, leaving 11 sodas (3 shaken and 8 unshaken). Ellen's brother then takes 1 shaken and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 8 sodas in total (2 shaken and 6 unshaken).

The probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas left divided by the total number of sodas left:
\[ P(\text{shaken}) = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas left}}{\text{Total number of sodas left}} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this probability as a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we first need to calculate the distance each train travels in that time.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. Therefore, the distance it covers in 3 hours is:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \]

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]
So, the distance it covers in 3 hours is:
\[ 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \]

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each has traveled:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \]

"To determine how many people Billy helps, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy takes off.
3. Calculate the number of days Billy works.
4. Calculate the total number of people he helps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.

Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy takes off.**

Billy takes 20% of the days off.

Number of days off = 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days

**Step 3: Calculate the number of days Billy works.**

Number of days Billy works = Total days - Days off = 50 - 10 = 40 days

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of people he helps.**

Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day.

People helped per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day

Total people helped = Number of days worked * People helped per day = 40 days * 6 people/day = 240 people

"To solve this, let's set up the relationships with equations. Let \( J \) represent Jeff's age, \( M \) represent Martha's age, and \( K \) represent Mike's age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha: \( J = M + 10 \)
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike: \( M = K - 4 \)
3. Mike is 24 years old: \( K = 24 \)

First, substitute \( K = 24 \) into the second equation to find Martha's age:
\[ M = 24 - 4 \]
\[ M = 20 \]

Now, substitute \( M = 20 \) into the first equation to find Jeff's age:
\[ J = 20 + 10 \]
\[ J = 30 \]

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old.

"To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each slide and then find the difference between these times.

First, calculate the time for the biggest slide:
- Length of the biggest slide: 300 feet
- Speed on the biggest slide: 60 feet/minute

Time for the biggest slide:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, calculate the time for the second biggest slide:
- Length of the second biggest slide: 240 feet
- Speed on the second biggest slide: 80 feet/minute

Time for the second biggest slide:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, find the difference in time between the two slides:
\[ \text{Difference} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

The biggest slide takes 2 minutes longer to ride compared to the second biggest slide.

"To find out how many hours Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to after 5 days, we first calculate the total time he spends on breaks and lunch each day.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and two 15-minute breaks each day. The total time spent on breaks and lunch per day is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 2 \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Bobby spends 1 hour on breaks and lunch each day.

Over 5 days, the total time spent on breaks and lunch is:
\[ 1 \text{ hour/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times the distance Amber ran, we calculate:

Micah's distance = 3.5 × Amber's distance
Micah's distance = 3.5 × 8 miles
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Next, we add the distances run by Amber and Micah to find the total distance they both ran:

Total distance (Amber + Micah) = Amber's distance + Micah's distance
Total distance (Amber + Micah) = 8 miles + 28 miles
Total distance (Amber + Micah) = 36 miles

Now, we subtract the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the overall total distance to find out how many miles Ahito ran:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - Total distance (Amber + Micah)
Ahito's distance = 52 miles - 36 miles
Ahito's distance = 16 miles

2. Subtract the cost of the returned item, which is $15.00.
3. Calculate the discounted price of the frying pan:
   - The original price of the frying pan is $20.00.
   - The discount is 20%, so the discount amount is 20% of $20.00, which is $4.00.
   - The discounted price of the frying pan is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.
4. Calculate the discounted price of the set of towels:
   - The original price of the set of towels is $30.00.
   - The discount is 10%, so the discount amount is 10% of $30.00, which is $3.00.
   - The discounted price of the set of towels is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.
5. Add the discounted prices of the frying pan and the set of towels to the balance after the return.

Let's do the calculations:

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

1. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).
2. A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).
3. We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Thus, \( \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \).

To find \( J \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]
\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( 90 \).

"To find the number of girls in the school, we first need to determine the total population of the school. Since 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys, we can set up the equation:

40% of total population = 240 boys

Let's convert 40% to a decimal for easier calculation:

40% = 0.40

So, 0.40 * total population = 240

To find the total population, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:

Total population = 240 / 0.40
Total population = 600

Now that we know the total population of the school is 600, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population:

Number of girls = Total population - Number of boys
Number of girls = 600 - 240
Number of girls = 360

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her 9,300-mile journey in June, we first need to calculate the total number of days in June and the total miles she plans to hike daily.

June has 30 days. If Soledad hikes 125 miles twice a day, she will hike:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/hike} \times 2 \text{ hikes/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total miles she will hike in June at this rate:
\[ 250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7500 \text{ miles} \]

Soledad's goal is to hike 9,300 miles. The additional miles needed are:
\[ 9300 \text{ miles} - 7500 \text{ miles} = 1800 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we divide the additional miles by the number of days in June:

"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we can start by calculating the total number of toys produced by the other four workers during their 10-hour shift.

First, let's calculate the production of the two workers who produce 6 toys per hour:
\[ 2 \text{ workers} \times 6 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ toys} \]

Next, let's calculate the production of the two workers who produce 4 toys per hour:
\[ 2 \text{ workers} \times 4 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 80 \text{ toys} \]

Now, let's add the production of these four workers:
\[ 120 \text{ toys} + 80 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to complete the order of 400 toys, which means the total number of toys produced by all five workers is:
\[ 400 \text{ toys} - 20 \text{ toys} = 380 \text{ toys} \]

Since the four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[ 380 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} = 180 \text{ toys} \]

The fifth worker worked for 10 hours, so the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is:

"To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs, we first need to determine the weights of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory’s dog.

Kory’s dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah’s first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah’s second dog is half the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weights of all three dogs:
\[ \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

1. Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob and kept 9 for himself. This means Kris had \(7 + 9 = 16\) stickers before giving any to Rob.
2. These 16 stickers were the remaining half of what Luis had after using half of the stickers he received from Seth. Therefore, Luis originally had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.
3. The 32 stickers Luis had were half of what Seth originally had. Therefore, Seth originally had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

"First, let's calculate the total number of M&Ms John has. Each large bag weighs 10 ounces, and there are 30 M&Ms per ounce. Therefore, each large bag contains:

10 ounces * 30 M&Ms/ounce = 300 M&Ms

Since John buys 3 large bags, the total number of M&Ms is:

3 large bags * 300 M&Ms/large bag = 900 M&Ms

Next, we need to determine how many small bags John can make if he puts 10 M&Ms in each small bag:

900 M&Ms / 10 M&Ms/small bag = 90 small bags

"To determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we first need to calculate half the circumference of the earth. 

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers, so half of this distance is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

"To find out how fast the fastest car goes, we need to follow the relationships step by step.

1. First, determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car:
   - The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.
   - The average car's speed is 120 miles per hour.
   - Therefore, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is \( 5 \times 120 = 600 \) miles per hour.

2. Next, determine the speed of the fastest car:
   - The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.
   - The speed of the 2nd fastest car is 600 miles per hour.
   - Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is \( 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \) miles per hour.

The speed of the fastest car is 750 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, let's set up a linear equation based on the information given.

Let \( V \) represent Vince's age two years ago. According to the problem, two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. Liam is currently 16 years old, so two years ago, Liam was 14 years old. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 14 = 2V \]

Now, solve for \( V \):

\[ V = \frac{14}{2} \]
\[ V = 7 \]

This means Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

\[ V + 2 = 7 + 2 \]
\[ V + 2 = 9 \]

So, Vince is currently 9 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables:
- Let \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted.
- Let \( M \) be the number of eggs Madeline painted.
- Let \( C \) be the number of eggs Camden painted.
- Let \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \( A = M \).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \( C + S = 30 \).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah: \( C = S + 12 \).
4. The total number of eggs painted is 56: \( A + M + C + S = 56 \).

Since \( A = M \), we can substitute \( M \) with \( A \) in the total equation:
\[ A + A + C + S = 56 \]
\[ 2A + C + S = 56 \]

We also know from the second and third pieces of information:
\[ C + S = 30 \]
\[ C = S + 12 \]

Substitute \( C = S + 12 \) into \( C + S = 30 \):
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 9 \) back into \( C = S + 12 \):
\[ C = 9 + 12 \]
\[ C = 21 \]

Now we have \( C = 21 \) and \( S = 9 \). Substitute these values into the total equation:
\[ 2A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Since \( A = M \), \( M = 13 \).

Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Thus, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of groups of 8 crayons.
2. Calculate the total number of boxes needed.
3. Calculate the total weight of the crayons.
4. Calculate the total weight of the boxes.
5. Add the total weight of the crayons and the boxes.
6. Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds.

Step 1: Determine the number of groups of 8 crayons.
Nik has 200 crayons, and he wants to put them into groups of 8.
\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total number of boxes needed.
Since each group of 8 crayons goes into one box, the number of boxes needed is the same as the number of groups.
\[ \text{Number of boxes} = 25 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total weight of the crayons.
Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and there are 200 crayons.
\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Step 4: Calculate the total weight of the boxes.
Each box weighs 8 ounces, and there are 25 boxes.
\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Step 5: Add the total weight of the crayons and the boxes.
\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Step 6: Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds.
There are 16 ounces in a pound.
\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds.

Step 1: Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns. Therefore, her brother earns:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Step 2: Their combined salary is:
\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Step 3: Their mother earns twice their combined salary:
\[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time Grandma spends walking, given the different rates at which she walks on the beach and the sidewalk.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( r \) be the rate at which Grandma walks on the beach (in miles per minute).
- Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her rate on the sidewalk is \( 2r \).

We know that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. The distance she covers on the beach is 2 miles. Using the formula \( \text{distance} = \text{rate} \times \text{time} \), we can write:
\[ 2 = r \times 40 \]
Solving for \( r \):
\[ r = \frac{2}{40} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Next, we need to find the time she spends walking on the sidewalk. The distance on the sidewalk is 1 mile, and her rate on the sidewalk is \( 2r \):
\[ 2r = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Using the formula \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{rate}} \), the time spent on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{time} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{10}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the entire walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ 50 \text{ minutes} \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much Jane has already saved. She saves $4 every week, and she has been saving for 8 weeks. So, the total amount saved so far is:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach her goal of $60. This can be calculated as:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jane saves $4 each week, we can find out how many more weeks she needs to save by dividing the remaining amount by her weekly savings:

\[ 28 \text{ dollars} \div 4 \text{ dollars/week} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

3 trees * 7 blue birds/tree = 21 blue birds

Next, we calculate the number of blue birds in the 2 trees that each had 4 blue birds:
2 trees * 4 blue birds/tree = 8 blue birds

Finally, we add the number of blue birds in the 1 tree that had 3 blue birds:
1 tree * 3 blue birds/tree = 3 blue birds

Now, we add all these numbers together to get the total number of blue birds:
21 blue birds + 8 blue birds + 3 blue birds = 32 blue birds

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many marbles Bob currently has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. Therefore, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles.

Let \( x \) represent the number of marbles Bob currently has. According to the problem, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles. Now, if Bob loses 10 marbles, we need to subtract 10 from 36 to find out how many marbles he will have:
\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug such that the mixture in Donny's water bottle is at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug.
- The temperature of the water in the 33-degree mug is 33 degrees.
- The volume of water from the 33-degree mug is 4 ounces.
- The volume of water from the second mug is 1 ounce.

The total volume of the mixture in the water bottle is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces.

The temperature of the mixture can be calculated using the weighted average of the temperatures of the two waters:

\[
\text{Mixture Temperature} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

We know that the mixture temperature must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):

\[
4 \times 33 = 132
\]

Now, substitute this into the inequality:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T \):

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Thus, the temperature of the water in the second mug must be at least 68 degrees.

\[
\boxed{68}

"To find the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to calculate the combined probability of two independent events. The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a probability of 0.20. The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first, so its probability of winning is 3 * 0.20 = 0.60.

The combined probability of both tickets winning is the product of their individual probabilities:

"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. Let's start by finding the heights of Ned and Carl based on Isabel's height.

1. Isabel's height is given as 7 feet.
2. Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned's height is:
   \[
   7 \text{ feet} - 2 \text{ feet} = 5 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so Carl's height is:
   \[
   5 \text{ feet} + 1 \text{ foot} = 6 \text{ feet}
   \]
4. Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so the length of Carl's cane is:
   \[
   \frac{6 \text{ feet}}{2} = 3 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is 3 feet.

"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would have to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bottles needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.
2. Determine how many bottles are currently produced.
3. Find the difference between the required number of bottles and the current production.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of bottles needed
Each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand. Therefore, to cover 100% of a person's daily energy demand, 5 bottles are needed (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

### Step 2: Determine the current production
Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.

### Step 3: Find the difference
To find out how many more bottles are needed:
\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce 7300 more bottles to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

"To determine how much money Abraham will earn after selling all his unused land, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Land Area:**
   Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.

2. **First Sale:**
   He sold half of the land for $50.
   - Half of 80 square meters is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.
   - After this sale, he has \( 80 - 40 = 40 \) square meters left.

3. **Second Sale:**
   He sold another 1/4 of his remaining land for $30.
   - 1/4 of 40 square meters is \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) square meters.
   - After this sale, he has \( 40 - 10 = 30 \) square meters left.

4. **Third Sale:**
   He sold the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter.
   - The total amount from this sale is \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars.

5. **Total Earnings:**
   - From the first sale: $50
   - From the second sale: $30
   - From the third sale: $90

   Adding these amounts together gives:

"To find Geb's age, we start by translating the given information into a mathematical equation. We know that Geb is 10 less than half the age of Haley. If Haley is 26 years old, we can express this as:

Geb's age = (1/2 * Haley's age) - 10

Substituting Haley's age into the equation:

Geb's age = (1/2 * 26) - 10

Now, calculate half of 26:

(1/2 * 26) = 13

Then, subtract 10 from 13:

13 - 10 = 3

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old.

"To find out how much money John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
2. Find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.
3. Calculate the total number of collections he makes in a week.
4. Determine his weekly earnings based on the number of collections and the rate per collection.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.**

The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have:
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two:
\[ 400 \times 0.60 = 240 \text{ apartments} \]
\[ 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

**Step 2: Find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.**

\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of collections he makes in a week.**

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment:
\[ 1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections} \]

**Step 4: Determine his weekly earnings.**

He gets paid $0.40 per collection:
\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \]

John makes $1248 in a week.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of fruits produced by an avocado tree over its first 10 years of life, given the production rates for each year.

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   3 \times 50 = 150 \text{ fruits}
   \]
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   7 \times 50 = 350 \text{ fruits}
   \]
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits.

"Let's denote the lengths of the red, blue, and yellow ropes as \( R \), \( B \), and \( Y \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope:
   \[
   R = 4B
   \]

2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:
   \[
   B = Y - 7
   \]

3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters:
   \[
   R + B + Y = 37
   \]

First, substitute \( R \) from the first equation into the third equation:
\[
4B + B + Y = 37
\]
\[
5B + Y = 37
\]

Next, substitute \( B \) from the second equation into the equation \( 5B + Y = 37 \):
\[
5(Y - 7) + Y = 37
\]
\[
5Y - 35 + Y = 37
\]
\[
6Y - 35 = 37
\]
\[
6Y = 72
\]
\[
Y = 12
\]

Now, substitute \( Y = 12 \) back into the second equation to find \( B \):
\[
B = Y - 7
\]
\[
B = 12 - 7
\]
\[
B = 5
\]

Finally, substitute \( B = 5 \) into the first equation to find \( R \):
\[
R = 4B
\]
\[
R = 4 \times 5
\]
\[
R = 20

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Ronnie was given $5.
2. Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.

After giving \(x\) dollars to their little sister:
- Ronnie is left with \(5 - x\) dollars.
- Rissa is left with \(15 - x\) dollars.

According to the problem, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The mural is divided into four colors: red, white, purple, and yellow.
2. Half of the mural is yellow, so the remaining half is divided equally among red, white, and purple.
3. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

First, let's determine how much of the mural is yellow:
- Half of the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint used is:
  \[

  \]

Since the remaining half is divided equally among red, white, and purple, each of these colors uses:
\[
\frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ pints}
\]

Therefore, the amount of red paint used is:
\[
2 \text{ pints}

"To solve this problem, we need to recognize that the number of cloud puffs Alice counts each day forms a geometric sequence. The first term \(a_1\) is 3, and the common ratio \(r\) is 2, since the number of puffs doubles each day.

The formula for the sum of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric sequence is:
\[ S_n = a_1 \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \]

Here, \(n = 5\) (since we are considering Monday through Friday), \(a_1 = 3\), and \(r = 2\).

Substituting these values into the formula:
\[ S_5 = 3 \frac{1 - 2^5}{1 - 2} \]
\[ S_5 = 3 \frac{1 - 32}{-1} \]
\[ S_5 = 3 \frac{-31}{-1} \]
\[ S_5 = 3 \times 31 \]
\[ S_5 = 93 \]

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, let's expand and simplify the first equation:
\[
W = 5(C + 7)
\]
\[
W = 5C + 35
\]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[
C + 25 = \frac{5C + 35}{3}
\]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[
75 = 2C + 35
\]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[
40 = 2C

Divide by 2:
\[
C = 20

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of slices her friends will consume.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

Total slices of cheese pizza consumed by 6 friends:
6 friends * 6 slices/friend = 36 slices

Total slices of pepperoni pizza consumed by 6 friends:
6 friends * 4 slices/friend = 24 slices

Next, we calculate how many whole pizzas are needed for each type:

For cheese pizza:
Each cheese pizza has 12 slices.
Number of cheese pizzas needed = 36 slices / 12 slices/pizza = 3 pizzas

For pepperoni pizza:
Each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices.
Number of pepperoni pizzas needed = 24 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 3 pizzas

Total number of pizzas needed:
3 cheese pizzas + 3 pepperoni pizzas = 6 pizzas

"To solve this problem, we need to consider both the rate at which Jay makes snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of making snowballs**: Jay makes 20 snowballs per hour.
2. **Rate of melting snowballs**: 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs melt per hour.

Now, let's calculate the net rate of snowball accumulation:
- Net rate = Rate of making - Rate of melting
- Net rate = 20 snowballs/hour - 8 snowballs/hour = 12 snowballs/hour

We need to find out how long it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs:
- Time required = Total snowballs needed / Net rate
- Time required = 60 snowballs / 12 snowballs/hour = 5 hours

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Determine the year Digimon came out. Since it had its 20th anniversary, we subtract 20 years from the current year. If the current year is 2023, then Digimon came out in 2023 - 20 = 2003.

2. Determine John's age when Digimon came out. If John is 28 years old now (in 2023), then in 2003, he was 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

3. According to the problem, when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. If John was 8 years old, then Jim was 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

4. Calculate Jim's current age. Since 20 years have passed since 2003, Jim's current age is 4 + 20 = 24 years old.

Therefore, Jim is 24 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of bandages used each day:**
   - **First day:** 38 bandages used.
   - **Second day:** 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages used.
   - **Third day:** They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.

2. **Calculate the total number of bandages used over the three days:**
   - Total used = \(38 + 28 + 25 = 91\) bandages.

3. **Determine the total number of bandages ordered:**
   - **First day:** 1 bulk pack = 50 bandages.
   - **Third day:** 2 bulk packs = 100 bandages.
   - Total ordered = \(50 + 100 = 150\) bandages.

4. **Calculate the total number of bandages available at the end of the third day:**
   - Total available = Initial bandages + Total ordered - Total used.
   - We know they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

5. **Set up the equation to find the initial number of bandages:**
   - Let \( x \) be the initial number of bandages.
   - \( x + 150 - 91 = 78 \).

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x + 59 = 78 \).
   - \( x = 78 - 59 \).
   - \( x = 19 \).

So, the initial number of bandages they started with on the first day is 19.

"To find the total number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have, we first need to determine the amount of blood in one shark. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and each whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the blood volume in one shark as follows:

Blood in one shark = 3 * Blood in one whale
Blood in one shark = 3 * 40 gallons
Blood in one shark = 120 gallons

Next, to find the total blood volume for ten sharks, we multiply the blood volume of one shark by 10:

Total blood in ten sharks = 10 * Blood in one shark
Total blood in ten sharks = 10 * 120 gallons
Total blood in ten sharks = 1200 gallons

"To find out how many pens Alain has, we need to calculate the total number of red and black pens.

First, we know that Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack contains 5 pens. So, the total number of red pens is:
5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens

Next, she bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens. Since she bought 5 packs of red pens, she bought:
2 * 5 packs = 10 packs of black pens

Each pack of black pens also contains 5 pens, so the total number of black pens is:
10 packs * 5 pens/pack = 50 black pens

Now, to find the total number of pens, we add the number of red pens and black pens together:
25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens

"First, let's calculate the cost per bottle of scotch:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{\text{Total cost of scotch}}{\text{Number of bottles}} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Next, we determine the number of bottles of cognac John buys:
\[ \text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times \text{Number of bottles of scotch} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

Now, we calculate the cost per bottle of cognac, which is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Then, we find the total cost of the cognac:
\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = \text{Number of bottles of cognac} \times \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac to find the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of scotch} + \text{Total cost of cognac} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the jar.
2. Determine the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans considering the packing efficiency.
3. Calculate the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar.
4. Estimate the number of red jelly beans based on the given percentage.
5. Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.**

The jar is a rectangular prism with a square base:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \, \text{inches} \times 6 \, \text{inches} \times 15 \, \text{inches} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans.**

The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume is:
\[ \text{Effective volume} = 540 \, \text{cubic inches} \times 0.80 = 432 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar.**

Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches:
\[ \text{Total number of jelly beans} = \frac{432 \, \text{cubic inches}}{0.15 \, \text{cubic inches/jelly bean}} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans} \]

**Step 4: Estimate the number of red jelly beans.**

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red:
\[ \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \, \text{jelly beans} \times 0.30 = 864 \, \text{red jelly beans} \]

**Step 5: Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.**

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between Tim's estimate and the true number is:
\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

Therefore, Tim's guess was off by 36 red jelly beans.

"To determine how much Pauline spent on all her visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost of visits before the price increase and the cost of visits after the price increase.

1. **Calculate the cost of visits before the price increase:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - The cost of one visit is $2.
   - She visits the museum for 5 years.
   - Total cost for 5 years = 3 visits/year * $2/visit * 5 years = $30.

2. **Calculate the new cost of one visit after the price increase:**
   - The cost of one visit increased by 150%.
   - 150% of $2 = 1.5 * $2 = $3.
   - New cost of one visit = $2 + $3 = $5.

3. **Calculate the cost of visits after the price increase:**
   - Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year for 3 more years.
   - Total cost for 3 years = 3 visits/year * $5/visit * 3 years = $45.

4. **Calculate the total cost for all visits:**
   - Total cost = Cost before price increase + Cost after price increase
   - Total cost = $30 + $45 = $75.

Therefore, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is $75.

"To determine how long it will take for all the students to try the escape room, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students who will try the escape room.
2. Determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed.
3. Calculate the total time required for all groups to complete the escape room.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of students.**
- There are 10 students from each grade.
- There are 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th).

Total number of students = 10 students/grade * 4 grades = 40 students

**Step 2: Determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed.**
- Each group can have 8 students.

Number of groups = Total number of students / Number of students per group
Number of groups = 40 students / 8 students/group = 5 groups

**Step 3: Calculate the total time required for all groups to complete the escape room.**
- Each group takes 45 minutes to complete the escape room.

Total time = Number of groups * Time per group
Total time = 5 groups * 45 minutes/group = 225 minutes

Therefore, it will take 225 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is:

"To determine how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning he will need, we first need to figure out how many pounds of ground beef he will use to make 80 meatballs.

Given:
- 16 meatballs are made from 1 pound of ground beef.
- Aiden wants to make 80 meatballs.

First, calculate the number of pounds of ground beef needed:
\[ \text{Pounds of ground beef} = \frac{\text{Total meatballs}}{\text{Meatballs per pound}} = \frac{80}{16} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 5 pounds of ground beef, the amount of seasoning needed is:
\[ \text{Total seasoning} = \text{Pounds of ground beef} \times \text{Seasoning per pound} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( c \) represent the number of cupcakes Carly makes.
Let \( b \) represent the number of brownies Carly makes.

From the problem, we know:
1. Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be written as:
   \[
   b = 3c - 2
   \]

2. Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
   \[
   5 \times 2 = 10
   \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and the number of brownies:
\[
c + b = 10
\]

Now, substitute the expression for \( b \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
c + (3c - 2) = 10
\]

Simplify and solve for \( c \):
\[
c + 3c - 2 = 10
\]
\[
4c - 2 = 10
\]
\[
4c = 12
\]
\[
c = 3
\]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount. The total cost for both without the discount is $35 + $40 = $75. With a 20% discount, the discount amount is 20% of $75, which is 0.20 * $75 = $15. So, the discounted price for both services is $75 - $15 = $60.

Next, we calculate the cost of the nail art. Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, which totals 10 nails. At $3 per nail, the cost for the nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

Adding the cost of the discounted manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art gives us $60 + $30 = $90.

Therefore, Karen would pay $90 in all.

"To find the final price of the toy after the changes in December and January, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price of the toy in December after the 80% increase.
2. Calculate the price of the toy in January after the 50% decrease from the December price.

**Step 1: Calculate the December price.**
- Original price in November: $40
- Increase in December: 80% of $40
- 80% of $40 = 0.80 * $40 = $32
- New price in December = $40 + $32 = $72

**Step 2: Calculate the January price.**
- Price in December: $72
- Decrease in January: 50% of $72
- 50% of $72 = 0.50 * $72 = $36
- New price in January = $72 - $36 = $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36.

"To find out how much time Charisma has spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time spent on meditation:
- Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so that's 15 minutes + 15 minutes = 30 minutes per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she meditates for 30 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 210 minutes/week.
- Over 4 weeks, the total meditation time is 210 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 840 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on yoga:
- Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour, 5 days a week. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, she practices 60 minutes * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week.
- Over 4 weeks, the total yoga time is 300 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1200 minutes.

Now, we add the total time spent on meditation and yoga:
- Total time = 840 minutes (meditation) + 1200 minutes (yoga) = 2040 minutes.

To convert the total time into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

"To find the total number of sunflower seeds, we first need to determine the number of seeds in each type of sunflower and then add them together.

1. Calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower:
   - A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds.
   - 1 dozen = 12 seeds.
   - Therefore, 3 dozen seeds = 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

2. Calculate the number of seeds in a large sunflower:
   - A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower.
   - 50% of 36 seeds = 0.5 * 36 = 18 seeds.
   - Therefore, the number of seeds in a large sunflower = 36 seeds + 18 seeds = 54 seeds.

3. Calculate the total number of seeds:
   - Total seeds = seeds in a small sunflower + seeds in a large sunflower.
   - Total seeds = 36 seeds + 54 seeds = 90 seeds.

"First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes each night. So, the net number of holes filled each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/night} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Now, we need to determine how many days it will take Nate to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

1. Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes.
2. Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, which is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.
3. Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, which is \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.
4. Igor gathered the correct number of beakers, which is 7.
5. The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.

Let's denote the number of beakers Igor lost as \( x \).

The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench can be expressed as:
\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29 \]

Simplify the equation:

   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, so Aaron ran \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.

2. **Determine the speeds of Aaron and Vanessa:**
   - Let \( v \) be Vanessa's speed in miles per minute.
   - Aaron's speed is twice Vanessa's speed, so Aaron's speed is \( 2v \).

3. **Determine the time taken by Aaron:**
   - Aaron ran 2 miles at a speed of \( 2v \) miles per minute.
   - Time taken by Aaron is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{2v \text{ miles/minute}} = \frac{1}{v} \) minutes.
   - We know Aaron took 16 minutes, so \( \frac{1}{v} = 16 \).
   - Solving for \( v \), we get \( v = \frac{1}{16} \) miles per minute.

4. **Determine the time taken by Vanessa:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles at a speed of \( v = \frac{1}{16} \) miles per minute.
   - Time taken by Vanessa is \( \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{16} \text{ miles/minute}} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \) minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in one hour and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of oranges each person can peel in one hour.

1. **Ana's peeling rate:**
   - Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour = \( \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges} \).

2. **Jane's peeling rate:**
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour = \( \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges} \).

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane in one hour:
- Difference = Number of oranges Ana peels - Number of oranges Jane peels
- Difference = 20 oranges - 15 oranges = 5 oranges

Therefore, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

1. Each chicken has 2 legs, and each cow has 4 legs.
2. The total number of animals is 20.
3. The total number of legs is 70.

We can write the following equations:
\[ C + K = 20 \]
\[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
\[ C + K = 20 \]
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Next, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( C \):
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.
