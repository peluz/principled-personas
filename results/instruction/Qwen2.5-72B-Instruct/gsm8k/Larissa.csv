"To determine the total number of bolts needed for a robe, we need to calculate the amount of blue fiber and white fiber required and then sum them up.

1. The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. The robe requires half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, it will take \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1 \) bolt of white fiber.

Adding the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together:
\[ 2 \text{ (blue bolts)} + 1 \text{ (white bolt)} = 3 \text{ bolts} \]

Therefore, the total number of bolts needed for the robe is 3.

"To determine Josh's profit, we first need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150% of the original purchase price.

1. Calculate the increase in value:
   \[ \text{Increase in value} = 150\% \times \$80,000 = 1.5 \times \$80,000 = \$120,000 \]

2. Calculate the new value of the house:
   \[ \text{New value} = \text{Original value} + \text{Increase in value} = \$80,000 + \$120,000 = \$200,000 \]

3. Calculate the total cost of the house including repairs:
   \[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Original purchase price} + \text{Cost of repairs} = \$80,000 + \$50,000 = \$130,000 \]

4. Calculate the profit:
   \[ \text{Profit} = \text{New value} - \text{Total cost} = \$200,000 - \$130,000 = \$70,000 \]

Therefore, Josh's profit is:
\[ \$70,000 \]"
"To find out how many total meters James runs a week, we can multiply the number of sprints he does each session by the distance of each sprint, and then multiply that by the number of times he runs per week.

Number of sprints per session: 3
Distance per sprint: 60 meters
Number of sessions per week: 3

Total meters per week = Number of sprints per session * Distance per sprint * Number of sessions per week

Total meters per week = 3 sprints/session * 60 meters/sprint * 3 sessions/week

Total meters per week = 540 meters

"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken needs per day:
   Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day.

2. Calculate the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock per day:
   Since Wendi has 20 chickens, the total feed needed per day is:
   \( 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \)

3. Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:
   In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed.
   In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups of feed.
   The total feed given by the afternoon is:
   \( 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \)

4. Calculate the amount of feed needed for the final meal:
   The total feed needed for the day is 60 cups, and 40 cups have already been given. Therefore, the amount of feed needed for the final meal is:
   \( 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \)

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time taken for Carla to download the 200 GB file, including the time lost due to the Windows update.

1. First, calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the file:
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, downloading 80 GB takes \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes.

2. Add the 20 minutes lost due to the Windows update:
   - Total time so far is \( 40 + 20 = 60 \) minutes.

3. After the update, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. The full file is 200 GB, and at 2 GB/minute, it takes:
   - \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) minutes to download the entire file.

4. Add the time to download the full file to the time already spent:
   - Total time is \( 60 + 100 = 160 \) minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is 160 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the distance John travels in each segment of his journey.

1. **Initial Journey Away from Home:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Journey:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles in this time.
   - For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - For the remaining 1.5 hours (since the total return time is 4 hours and 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 hours have already passed), he drives at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Covered on the Return Journey:**
   - Total distance = 0 miles (standstill) + 15 miles (30 mph) + 120 miles (80 mph) = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - John initially traveled 180 miles away from home.
   - He then traveled 135 miles back towards home.
   - Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

Therefore, John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to consider both her regular pay for the first 40 hours and her overtime pay for the additional hours she worked.

1. Calculate the regular pay for the first 40 hours:
   Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

2. Calculate the number of overtime hours:
   Overtime hours = Total hours worked - Regular hours = 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours

3. Calculate the overtime pay rate:
   Overtime pay rate = Regular hourly rate * 1.2 = $10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour

4. Calculate the total overtime pay:
   Overtime pay = Overtime hours * Overtime pay rate = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

5. Calculate the total earnings for the week:
   Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are:

"To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. First month: 60 downloads.
2. Second month: The number of downloads is three times the first month, so \( 60 \times 3 = 180 \) downloads.
3. Third month: The number of downloads is reduced by 30% from the second month. A 30% reduction means the program retains 70% of the second month's downloads. So, \( 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \) downloads.

Now, we add the downloads from all three months to get the total:

\( 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \)

366"
"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then sum them up.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit per year and see when the total profit exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: $90
2. **Annual Income from Lemons**: 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5
3. **Annual Cost for Watering and Feeding**: $3

**Net Annual Profit**:
\[ \text{Net Annual Profit} = \text{Annual Income} - \text{Annual Cost} \]
\[ \text{Net Annual Profit} = \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5 \]

To find out how many years it will take to recover the initial cost:
\[ \text{Number of Years} = \frac{\text{Initial Cost}}{\text{Net Annual Profit}} \]
\[ \text{Number of Years} = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12 \]

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

2. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there.

3. After selling at the green house, she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

4. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

5. At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, which means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners.

6. After selling at the orange house, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left, so the remaining amount is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

7. Solving the equation for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her weekly earnings from both jobs and then multiply by the number of weeks she works in a year.

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings from teaching:
- She earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week.
- Weekly earnings from teaching = $20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings from being a cheerleading coach:
- She earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week.
- Weekly earnings from coaching = $30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Now, let's find her total weekly earnings:
- Total weekly earnings = Earnings from teaching + Earnings from coaching
- Total weekly earnings = $700/week + $450/week = $1150/week

Finally, to find her annual salary, we multiply her total weekly earnings by the number of weeks she works in a year:
- Annual salary = Total weekly earnings * Number of weeks worked per year
- Annual salary = $1150/week * 50 weeks/year = $57,500/year

Jill's annual salary is $57,500.

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we first need to calculate the total time she should take to complete the 12-mile trail.

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given that Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour over a 12-mile trail, we can set up the equation:
\[ 4 = \frac{12}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Solving for Total Time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already taken 2 hours to walk the first 6 miles (1 hour for the first 4 miles and another hour for the next 2 miles). Therefore, she has 1 hour left to complete the remaining 6 miles.

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, we use the formula for speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in both the orange drink and the pineapple drink, and then sum these amounts after accounting for the spill.

First, let's calculate the amount of water in the orange drink:
- The orange drink is 10 liters, and two-thirds of it is water.
- Therefore, the amount of water in the orange drink is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \) liters.

Since 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, the remaining amount of orange drink is 9 liters. The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:
- \( \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \) liters.

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink:
- The pineapple drink is 15 liters, and three-fifths of it is water.
- Therefore, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \) liters.

Now, we add the amounts of water from the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink:
- Total water = 6 liters (from the orange drink) + 9 liters (from the pineapple drink) = 15 liters.

Thus, the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture is 15 liters.

"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Raymond's current age.
2. Calculate the age of Raymond when his son was born.
3. Subtract the age of Raymond when his son was born from his current age to find out how many years ago his son was born.

First, we know that Samantha is 31 years old and Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha. So, Raymond's current age is:

31 (Samantha's age) + 6 (years older than Samantha) = 37 years old.

Raymond had his son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago his son was born, we subtract the age Raymond was when his son was born from his current age:

37 (Raymond's current age) - 23 (age when his son was born) = 14 years ago.

So, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.

"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to calculate the total cost of the other items she bought and subtract that from the total amount she paid. Then, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of one box of pizza.

First, let's calculate the cost of the chicken meal, the milk, and the apples:

- The chicken meal costs $12.
- The 5 packs of milk cost 5 * $3 = $15.
- The 4 apples cost 4 * $1.50 = $6.

Now, let's add these costs together to find the total cost of these items:

$12 (chicken meal) + $15 (milk) + $6 (apples) = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50, so the amount spent on pizza is:

$50 (total paid) - $33 (cost of other items) = $17.

Now, we divide the amount spent on pizza by the cost of one box of pizza to find out how many boxes she bought:

$17 / $8.50 (cost per box of pizza) = 2.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Calculate how many cartons of ice cream she will need.
3. Compute the total cost based on the number of cartons.

Step 1: Number of servings in 60 days
Cynthia eats 1 serving per day, so in 60 days, she will eat:
1 serving/day * 60 days = 60 servings

Step 2: Number of cartons needed
Each carton contains 15 servings, so the number of cartons she will need is:
60 servings / 15 servings/carton = 4 cartons

Step 3: Total cost
Each carton costs $4.00, so the total cost for 4 cartons is:
4 cartons * $4.00/carton = $16.00

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to consider the distances given:

- The first stop was after 20 miles.
- The second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip, which means the second stop was at 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

The distance between the first and second stops is the difference between these two points:

45 miles (second stop) - 20 miles (first stop) = 25 miles.

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

"To find the cost of the boots, we first need to determine the total cost of the two pairs of high heels. One pair of heels costs $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, which is $33 * 2 = $66.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots, we can set up the following equation to find the cost of the boots:

Cost of boots = Cost of two pairs of high heels + $5

Cost of boots = $99 + $5 = $104

Therefore, the boots cost $104.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and their total age.

The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11. This means that for every 7 units of Darrell's age, Allen's age is 11 units. Together, these units add up to 162, which is their total age.

Let's denote Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The equation for their total age is:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combine like terms:
\[18x = 162\]

Solve for \(x\):
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we can find their current ages:
- Darrell's age = \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)
- Allen's age = \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109.

"To find the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to first determine what each friend guessed and then calculate the average of those guesses.

1. The first friend guessed 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guessed 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guessed 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 80 + 20, which is 100.

Now, we add up all the guesses and divide by the number of guesses to find the average:

80 (first guess) + 60 (second guess) + 100 (third guess) = 240

To find the average:

240 / 3 = 80

The average guess is 80.

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:

\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:

\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4 points:
25% of 4 = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 1 point more than the 4 points he scored in the first 20 minutes:
4 points + 1 point = 5 points

Now, we add the points from both periods to get the total points:
4 points (first 20 minutes) + 5 points (second 20 minutes) = 9 points

Total points scored: 9"
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine the cost per yogurt based on the sale price.
3. Calculate the total cost for the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.

Step 1: Total number of yogurts in 30 days
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats:
2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts

Step 2: Cost per yogurt
The sale price is 4 yogurts for $5.00, so the cost per yogurt is:
$5.00 / 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt

Step 3: Total cost for 30 days
The total cost for 60 yogurts is:
60 yogurts * $1.25 per yogurt = $75.00

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

"John initially has 13 lego sets. After selling them, he uses the money to buy video games and has $5 left. To find out how many lego sets he still has, we need to determine if he sold all of them or not.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets:
13 lego sets * $15 per set = $195

Next, we calculate the total cost of the video games he buys:
8 video games * $20 per game = $160

Now, we add the $5 he has left to the cost of the video games to find out how much money he actually spent:
$160 + $5 = $165

Since the amount of money he made from selling the lego sets ($195) is more than the amount he spent ($165), it means he sold all of his lego sets.

Therefore, the number of lego sets John still has is:

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his average speed. Speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time.

First, let's determine the total time John spends running each week.

- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which is \(3 / 2 = 1.5\) hours each day.

So, the total time he spends running each week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that John runs a total of 60 miles a week.

To find his average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds and then calculate the distance she can travel in six hours, given the time spent running and walking.

1. **Determine Dana's skipping speed and use it to find her running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
   - Skipping speed is half as fast as running speed.
   - Therefore, running speed = 2 * skipping speed = 2 * 3 miles per hour = 6 miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Running speed is four times faster than walking speed.
   - Therefore, walking speed = running speed / 4 = 6 miles per hour / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time = 6 hours.
   - Time spent running = one-third of the total time = 6 hours / 3 = 2 hours.
   - Time spent walking = two-thirds of the total time = 2 * (6 hours / 3) = 4 hours.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   - Distance running = running speed * time spent running = 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   - Distance walking = walking speed * time spent walking = 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = distance running + distance walking = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 18 miles.

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips.
2. Determine the number of calories you can still consume to meet your daily target.
3. Calculate how many grams of chips correspond to the number of calories you can still consume.

Step 1: Total calories in the 300g bag
- The bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories.
- Total calories = 5 servings * 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories

Step 2: Calories you can still consume
- Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
- You have already consumed 1800 calories.
- Remaining calories = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories

Step 3: Grams of chips you can eat
- Each serving is 300g / 5 servings = 60g
- Each serving has 250 calories, so 1 calorie corresponds to 60g / 250 calories = 0.24g per calorie
- For 200 calories, you can eat 200 calories * 0.24g/calorie = 48g

Therefore, you can eat 48 grams of chips.

"To determine Charlie's net profit from making and selling 20 candles, we need to calculate the total cost of the supplies and the total revenue from selling the candles, then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

1. **Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed:**
   - Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, to make 20 candles, Charlie needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the beeswax and wicks:**
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00. Therefore, for 2 pounds, the cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times 10 \text{ dollars per pound} = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00, so the total revenue from 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times 2 \text{ dollars per candle} = 40 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
     \[
     40 \text{ dollars} - 20 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Candice started with 80 Post-it notes and then bought a package with an unknown number of Post-it notes, which we'll call \( x \). She used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 left over. The total number of Post-it notes she had before using them is the sum of the Post-it notes she started with and the ones she bought. The equation to represent this situation is:

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the package that Candice purchased contained 163 Post-it notes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of blue ties John bought:**
   - John spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40.
   - Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
   - Number of blue ties = $200 / $40 = 5 blue ties

2. **Determine the number of red ties John bought:**
   - John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
   - Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
   - Number of red ties = 2 * 5 = 10 red ties

3. **Determine the cost of each red tie:**
   - The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties.
   - Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + 50% of the cost of each blue tie
   - Cost of each red tie = $40 + 0.5 * $40 = $40 + $20 = $60

4. **Calculate the total amount spent on red ties:**
   - Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
   - Total spent on red ties = 10 * $60 = $600

5. **Calculate the total amount spent on all ties:**
   - Total spent on all ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
   - Total spent on all ties = $200 + $600 = $800

Therefore, the total amount John spent on ties is:

"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.
2. Calculate the daily income from selling the eggs.
3. Calculate the weekly income by multiplying the daily income by 7 (the number of days in a week).

Step 1: Number of dozens of eggs produced per day
There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide the total number of eggs produced per day by 12.
252 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 21 dozens

Step 2: Daily income from selling the eggs
Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, so we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen.
21 dozens * $2 per dozen = $42

Step 3: Weekly income
To find the weekly income, we multiply the daily income by 7.
$42 per day * 7 days = $294

Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. Since he travels at a rate of 10 miles per hour and he sails for 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM), the distance he covers is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how long it takes him to travel back at a rate of 6 miles per hour, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

- On weekdays (Monday to Friday), she teaches 5 classes each day, so for 5 days, that's 5 classes/day * 5 days = 25 classes.
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.
- Total classes in a week = 25 classes (weekdays) + 8 classes (Saturday) = 33 classes.

Next, let's find the total number of students Judy teaches in a week:
- Each class has 15 students.
- Total students in a week = 33 classes * 15 students/class = 495 students.

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of money Judy makes:
- She charges $15.00 per student.
- Total money made in a week = 495 students * $15.00/student = $7,425.00.

So, Judy makes $7,425.00 in one week.

"To find the total number of instructions Kelian has to read to prepare the two dishes, we need to add the number of instructions for each recipe.

The first recipe has 20 instructions. The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, which means it has \(20 \times 2 = 40\) instructions.

Adding the instructions from both recipes together, we get:
\[20 + 40 = 60\]

So, Kelian has to read 60 instructions in total.

"To find out how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to calculate the total cost of the cell phones including the interest, and then divide that total by the number of months in the installment plan.

1. First, calculate the total cost of the cell phones without interest:
   \( 5 \text{ phones} \times \$150 \text{ per phone} = \$750 \)

2. Next, calculate the total interest for all the phones:
   \( 2\% \text{ interest per phone} \times \$150 \text{ per phone} \times 5 \text{ phones} = 0.02 \times \$150 \times 5 = \$15 \)

3. Add the total interest to the total cost of the phones to get the total amount to be paid:
   \( \$750 + \$15 = \$765 \)

4. Finally, divide the total amount by the number of months in the installment plan to find the monthly payment:
   \( \$765 \div 3 \text{ months} = \$255 \)

Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months.

"To solve this problem, we first need to round the prices of each type of flower to the nearest dollar:

- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3.00
- Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2.00
- Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2.00

Next, we calculate the total sales for each type of flower:

- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3.00 = $36.00
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2.00 = $18.00
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2.00 = $34.00

Finally, we add up the total sales from all the flowers:

$36.00 + $18.00 + $34.00 = $88.00

So, Artie will make $88.00.

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-leveled sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level, starting from the top and working our way down.

Given that the top level (Level 4) has a square footage of 16, and each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of the other levels as follows:

- Level 4: 16 square feet
- Level 3: 16 * 2 = 32 square feet
- Level 2: 32 * 2 = 64 square feet
- Level 1: 64 * 2 = 128 square feet

Now, we add up the square footage of all levels and divide by the number of levels to find the average:

Total square footage = 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet

Number of levels = 4

Average square footage per level = Total square footage / Number of levels = 240 / 4 = 60 square feet

"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 365 days and then divide that by the number of cups in one bag.

1. Calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
   - 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups

2. Calculate the amount of dog food needed for the remaining days of the year (365 - 180 = 185 days):
   - 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups

3. Add the amounts from both periods to get the total amount of dog food needed for the first year:
   - 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

4. Determine how many bags of dog food are needed:
   - 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, David does:
   \[ \text{David's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{4} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Therefore, Raymond does:
   \[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{2} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

4. The difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David is:

"To find the cost of the grooming after the discount, you first calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the original cost.

The original cost of grooming is $100. The discount is 30%, which means the discount amount is 30% of $100.

Discount amount = 30% of $100 = 0.30 * $100 = $30

Now, subtract the discount amount from the original cost to find the final cost.

Final cost = Original cost - Discount amount = $100 - $30 = $70

The grooming cost after the discount is $70.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, determine how much water each girl received. Since each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water:
   \[ \text{Water per girl} = \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

2. Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they received together is:
   \[ \text{Total water for girls} = 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

3. The boy received 6 liters of water.

4. Now, calculate the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy:
   \[ \text{Total water taken} = 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

5. Finally, subtract the total amount of water taken from the initial 24 liters to find out how much water is left:

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( W \) represent the number of games won, and \( L \) represent the number of games lost. According to the problem, the team played 22 games in total, so we have:

\[ W + L = 22 \]

We are also told that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which gives us another equation:

\[ W = L + 8 \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find the number of games they won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:

\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the salary increases she will receive over the next three years, starting from the point where she has completed five years of service.

1. **Initial Monthly Salary**: $600
2. **Initial Annual Salary**: $600 * 12 = $7,200

Since Sylvie has just completed five years of service, she is eligible for her first 10% salary increase.

3. **First Year Increase (Year 6)**:
   - New Monthly Salary: $600 + ($600 * 10%) = $600 + $60 = $660
   - New Annual Salary: $660 * 12 = $7,920

4. **Second Year Increase (Year 7)**:
   - New Monthly Salary: $660 + ($660 * 10%) = $660 + $66 = $726
   - New Annual Salary: $726 * 12 = $8,712

5. **Third Year Increase (Year 8)**:
   - New Monthly Salary: $726 + ($726 * 10%) = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

"To determine how much Christina will spend on gift bags, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of guests who will actually attend the party.
2. Determine the number of gift bags needed based on the attendance.
3. Calculate the total cost of the gift bags.

Step 1: Calculate the number of guests who will actually attend the party.
Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, 3/4 of the invited guests will attend. Christina invited 16 friends, so the number of attendees will be:
\[ 16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12 \]

Step 2: Determine the number of gift bags needed.
Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per attending guest. Therefore, the number of gift bags needed is:

"To determine how many pounds of potato salad Ted the T-Rex needs to bring to the picnic, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of potato salad the adult dinosaurs will eat.
2. Calculate the total amount of potato salad the child dinosaurs will eat.
3. Add the two amounts together to get the total amount of potato salad needed.

First, we calculate the amount of potato salad the adult dinosaurs will eat:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adult dinosaurs.
- Therefore, the total amount of potato salad for the adults is \( 10 \, \text{lbs/adult} \times 20 \, \text{adults} = 200 \, \text{lbs} \).

Next, we calculate the amount of potato salad the child dinosaurs will eat:
- Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats \( 10 \, \text{lbs} / 2 = 5 \, \text{lbs} \).
- There are 5 child dinosaurs.
- Therefore, the total amount of potato salad for the children is \( 5 \, \text{lbs/child} \times 5 \, \text{children} = 25 \, \text{lbs} \).

Finally, we add the two amounts together to get the total amount of potato salad needed:
- Total potato salad needed = \( 200 \, \text{lbs} + 25 \, \text{lbs} = 225 \, \text{lbs} \).

So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how fast Gerald could run the 400-meter hurdles before he changed his diet. We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds and that he used to be two seconds faster than Gerald. This means that before the diet change, Gerald's time was:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's time} + 2 \text{ seconds} \]
\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} \]
\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to calculate Gerald's new time after his diet improved his speed by 10%. An improvement in speed by 10% means that Gerald can now run the same distance in 90% of his original time. Therefore, his new time is:

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = \text{Gerald's original time} \times 0.90 \]
\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = 40 \text{ seconds} \times 0.90 \]
\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

So, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

2. **Determine the combined number of dogs and cats:**
   - The number of dogs is 60.
   - The number of cats is 120.
   - The combined number of dogs and cats is \( 60 + 120 = 180 \).

3. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   - The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.
   - Therefore, the number of rabbits is \( 180 - 12 = 168 \).

4. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   - The total number of pets is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits.
   - The number of dogs is 60.
   - The number of cats is 120.
   - The number of rabbits is 168.

1. Calculate the number of boys:
   - There are 200 Grade 5 students in total.
   - 2/5 of the students are boys.
   - Number of boys = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \).

2. Calculate the number of girls:
   - Total students = 200.
   - Number of girls = Total students - Number of boys = 200 - 80 = 120.

3. Calculate the number of girls in the Girl Scout:
   - 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scout.
   - Number of girls in the Girl Scout = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \).

4. Calculate the number of girls not in the Girl Scout:

"To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we first need to calculate how long James slept. James slept 2/3 of the time Harry did. Since Harry slept 9 hours, we calculate James's sleep time as follows:

James's sleep time = 2/3 * Harry's sleep time
James's sleep time = 2/3 * 9
James's sleep time = 6 hours

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract James's sleep time from Harry's sleep time:

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the original volume of tomatoes before cooking.
2. Calculate how many cans of tomatoes were used.
3. Convert the number of cans into the number of tomatoes.

Step 1: Determine the original volume of tomatoes before cooking.
Since the volume of the tomatoes is reduced by half when cooked into sauce, the original volume of tomatoes must have been twice the volume of the sauce. Freda made 32 ounces of sauce, so the original volume of tomatoes was:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Step 2: Calculate how many cans of tomatoes were used.
Each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes. To find out how many cans were used, we divide the total original volume by the volume of one can:
\[ 64 \text{ ounces} \div 16 \text{ ounces/can} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Step 3: Convert the number of cans into the number of tomatoes.
Each can contains three tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:
\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

So, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of cars**: There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.
2. **Cars that took an exit**: 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.
3. **Remaining cars**: After 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars left in the line is \(30 - 5 = 25\) cars.
4. **Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes**: 20 cars drove through in the last 15 minutes of the traffic jam.
5. **Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes**: Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \(x\).

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the last 15 minutes, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

Solving for \(x\):
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

"To find the total number of doorbell rings, let's break down the information given:

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, which means the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we add up all the doorbell presses:

- First friend: 20 times
- Second friend: 25 times
- Third friend: 70 times
- Fourth friend: 60 times

   \[ \text{Pieces placed by mom} = \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \]

4. Finally, we determine how many pieces are left to be placed after her mom has placed her pieces:
   \[ \text{Remaining pieces after mom} = 750 - 250 = 500 \]

So, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is:

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box by subtracting the thickness of the walls from each dimension. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The inner dimensions will be:

- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:

Inner volume of one box = Length * Width * Height
Inner volume of one box = 3 inches * 4 inches * 2 inches
Inner volume of one box = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:

Total inner volume = Inner volume of one box * Number of boxes
Total inner volume = 24 cubic inches * 3
Total inner volume = 72 cubic inches

"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the total time he spent watching TV each night and then solve for the unknown.

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: \( x \) 30-minute episodes
- Thursday: 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

The total time spent watching TV is 7 hours. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 1 + 1 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 5.5 + 0.5x = 7 \]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

\[ 0.5x = 1.5 \]

Divide both sides by 0.5:

\[ x = 3 \]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30-minute shows on Wednesday.

"To find out how many cookies Henry baked last year, we can work backwards from the information given.

1. Henry ends up with 110 cookies after dropping 5, so before dropping any, he had:
   110 + 5 = 115 cookies.

2. The 115 cookies are 15 more than he intended to bake, so the number he intended to bake is:
   115 - 15 = 100 cookies.

3. He intended to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year, so the number of cookies he baked last year is:
   100 / 2 = 50 cookies.

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate on average, we first need to calculate the total area of the fruit roll-ups each of them had.

For Beatrice:
- Her fruit roll-up was 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- The total area for Beatrice's roll-up is \(2 \times 24 = 48\) roll-ups.

For Marcell:
- His fruit roll-up was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- The total area for Marcell's roll-up is \(3 \times 14 = 42\) roll-ups.

Now, to find the average number of roll-ups they ate, we add the total number of roll-ups and divide by 2 (since there are two people):

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{48 + 42}{2} = \frac{90}{2} = 45

"To determine how much water Julia's boat took on by the time she reached the shore, we need to calculate the total distance she rowed and then use that to find out the total amount of water that entered the boat.

First, we find out how far Julia rowed in 64 seconds. We know that she rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. We can set up a proportion to find out how many feet she rows in 64 seconds:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{x \text{ feet}}{64 \text{ seconds}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{20 \text{ feet} \times 64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}} \]
\[ x = \frac{1280 \text{ feet} \cdot \text{seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}} \]
\[ x = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we know Julia rowed 80 feet, we can calculate the amount of water that entered the boat. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. We can set up another proportion to find out how many liters of water entered the boat over 80 feet:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = \frac{y \text{ liters}}{80 \text{ feet}} \]

Solving for \( y \):

\[ y = \frac{2 \text{ liters} \times 80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} \]
\[ y = \frac{160 \text{ liters} \cdot \text{feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} \]
\[ y = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:**
   - Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   - Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
   - Therefore, Brittany's phone can hold \( \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \) photographs.

2. **Determine the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph:**
   - The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
   - Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.
   - Let \( d \) be the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
   - Therefore, \( 300 = 50d \).

3. **Solve for \( d \):**

"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue she will make from selling it at the new, increased price. Then, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - She bought 10 boards at $10 each.
   - Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100

2. **Calculate the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - She bought 5 boards at $16 each.
   - Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80

3. **Calculate the total cost of all the lumber:**
   - Total cost = $100 (2 x 4 x 10 boards) + $80 (4 x 4 x 10 boards) = $180

4. **Determine the new selling price for each type of board:**
   - The price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards increased by 50%, so the new price is $10 * 1.50 = $15 per board.
   - The price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards increased by 50%, so the new price is $16 * 1.50 = $24 per board.

5. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Total revenue for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $15/board = $150

6. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Total revenue for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $24/board = $120

7. **Calculate the total revenue from selling all the lumber:**
   - Total revenue = $150 (2 x 4 x 10 boards) + $120 (4 x 4 x 10 boards) = $270

8. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $270 - $180 = $90

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many teaspoons of sugar Katy used, given the total amount of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water and the ratio between them.

The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total parts in the ratio are 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined. We can set up the following proportion to find out how many of these 120 parts are teaspoons of sugar:

\[
\frac{7}{20} = \frac{x}{120}
\]

Where \( x \) is the number of teaspoons of sugar. To solve for \( x \), we can cross-multiply and solve the equation:

\[
7 \times 120 = 20 \times x
\]

\[
840 = 20x

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of vehicles that were already at the port before the second day. According to the information, there were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles. So, the total number of vehicles on the first day is:

2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles that were already there:

30 vehicles (total) - 10 vehicles (from the first day) = 20 vehicles (added on the second day)

Since each container holds 5 vehicles, we can calculate the number of containers that were imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:

20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach to determine the salaries of both Adrien and Lylah four years later.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary.
   - Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago.
   - Therefore, \( 40,000 = L + 0.30L \).
   - Simplifying, \( 40,000 = 1.30L \).
   - Solving for \( L \), \( L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} \).
   - \( L = 30,769.23 \) (approximately).

2. **Determine Adrien's salary four years later:**
   - Adrien's salary increased by 40% from four years ago.
   - Therefore, Adrien's new salary is \( 40,000 + 0.40 \times 40,000 \).
   - Simplifying, \( 40,000 + 16,000 = 56,000 \).

3. **Determine Lylah's salary four years later:**
   - Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's salary.
   - Therefore, Lylah's new salary is \( 30,769.23 + 0.40 \times 30,769.23 \).
   - Simplifying, \( 30,769.23 + 12,307.69 = 43,076.92 \).

4. **Calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later:**
   - Total salary = Adrien's salary + Lylah's salary.
   - Total salary = \( 56,000 + 43,076.92 \).
   - Total salary = \( 99,076.92 \).

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:

"To find the number of pink gumballs, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as \( B \) and the number of pink gumballs as \( P \).

According to the problem, there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. This can be written as:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

We are also given that there are 12 blue gumballs, so \( B = 12 \). Substituting this value into the equation gives:
\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

So, there are 70 pink gumballs.

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. 

The number of semi-automatic cars is:
20 (total cars) - 12 (automatic cars) - 4 (manual cars) = 4 (semi-automatic cars)

To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given:

- Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.
- Let \( B \) represent the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) represent the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we know:
1. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \).
2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
3. The total number of bees in the hive is 700: \( Q + B + W = 700 \).

First, substitute \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ W = 2(2Q) = 4Q \]

Now, substitute \( B \) and \( W \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200 \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is:

"To calculate the total cost, we need to first identify which items are nonfood and then apply the 10% tax to those items. Milk and eggs are food items, so they are not taxed. The nonfood items are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps.

The cost of the food items is:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
Total for food items: $2 + $3 = $5

The cost of the nonfood items before tax is:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4
Total for nonfood items: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

The tax on the nonfood items is 10% of $10, which is:
$10 * 0.10 = $1

The total cost of the nonfood items after tax is:
$10 + $1 = $11

The total cost for everything is the sum of the food items and the taxed nonfood items:
$5 + $11 = $16

"To calculate Kim's weekly profit, we need to determine his total expenses and subtract them from his total income.

First, let's calculate the total number of clients:
- Current clients: 3
- Potential clients: 5
- Total clients: 3 + 5 = 8

Next, we calculate the total expenses for the cleaning supplies:
- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
- Cost of bleach per client: 2 bottles * $2/bottle = $4
- Cost of cloths per client: 1 pack * $5/pack = $5
- Total cost per client: $4 (bleach) + $5 (cloths) = $9

Now, we calculate the total expenses for all clients:
- Total expenses: 8 clients * $9/client = $72

Kim's total income is given as $92.

Finally, we calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total income - Total expenses
- Profit = $92 - $72 = $20

"To find out how many blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the total number of pieces from all the Lego sets he dumped on the floor.

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, which means it has \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first set, which means it has \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

Now, we add up all the pieces from the three sets:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

So, Johnny picks up 2125 blocks.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and calculate the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the 30 bees return, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees.
3. In the following 6 hours, two times as many bees as the initial 30 bees leave the hive, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.
4. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before and hadn't already returned comes back to the hive. This means the bees that left in the first 6 hours (30 bees) and the bees that left in the third 6-hour period (60 bees) minus the bees that returned in the second 6-hour period (15 bees) will return.

So, the total number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is:
\[ 30 + 60 - 15 = 75 \]

Therefore, Debra saw 75 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then add the change she received to this amount.

The cost of 1 adult ticket is $12.
The cost of 1 child ticket is $10.

The total cost for 1 adult and 1 child ticket is:
$12 (adult ticket) + $10 (child ticket) = $22

Brittany's mom received $8 in change, which means the amount she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets plus the change she received:
$22 (total cost of tickets) + $8 (change) = $30

Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home and then find the difference between these times.

First, we convert the distances from miles to feet because the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

Steve's distance to home in feet:
3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet

Tim's distance to home in feet:
2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home by dividing the distance by the speed.

Steve's time to get home:
15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes

Tim's time to get home:
10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

The difference in time between the two is:
40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

So, the winner will be waiting for 4 minutes before the loser finishes the race.

"To calculate how much Shawnda made, we need to determine the total number of tires she inflated and then multiply that by the cost per tire.

- Bicycles have 2 tires each. If 5 people came by with bicycles, that's 5 bicycles * 2 tires/bicycle = 10 tires.
- Tricycles have 3 tires each. If 3 people came by with tricycles, that's 3 tricycles * 3 tires/tricycle = 9 tires.
- A unicycle has 1 tire. If 1 person came by with a unicycle, that's 1 unicycle * 1 tire/unicycle = 1 tire.

Now, we add up all the tires: 10 tires (bicycles) + 9 tires (tricycles) + 1 tire (unicycle) = 20 tires.

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, so the total amount made is 20 tires * 25 cents/tire = 500 cents.

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert 500 cents to dollars: 500 cents / 100 cents/dollar = 5 dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final number of fries left to the original number. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Final fries left:** 5 fries.
2. **Ants carried off 1 fry:** Before the ants, there were \(5 + 1 = 6\) fries.
3. **Raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries:** If the raccoon stole two-thirds, then one-third was left. So, the 6 fries represent one-third of the fries before the raccoon took them. Therefore, before the raccoon, there were \(6 \times 3 = 18\) fries.
4. **Three pigeons each ate 3 fries:** The pigeons ate a total of \(3 \times 3 = 9\) fries. So, before the pigeons, there were \(18 + 9 = 27\) fries.
5. **Seagull ate half the amount Dave ate:** Dave ate 14 fries, so the seagull ate \(14 / 2 = 7\) fries. Therefore, before the seagull, there were \(27 + 7 = 34\) fries.
6. **Dave ate 14 fries:** Before Dave, there were \(34 + 14 = 48\) fries.

So, the original number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was:

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the weekly class hours and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on each type of day:

- **Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays**: Kimo has 3 classes, each 1 hour long.
  \[
  3 \text{ classes} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours/day}
  \]
  Since there are 3 such days in a week:
  \[
  3 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

- **Tuesdays and Thursdays**: Kimo has 2 classes, each 2 hours long.
  \[
  2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours/day}
  \]
  Since there are 2 such days in a week:
  \[
  4 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days/week} = 8 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

Next, we add the hours from all days to get the total weekly class hours:
\[
9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Finally, we multiply the weekly class hours by the number of weeks in the semester to get the total class hours for the semester:
\[
17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:

"To find the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit, in this case, feet. 

1. **Convert the length of the rolls to feet:**
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so each roll is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls, so the total length of the rolls is \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.

2. **Convert the length of the croissants to feet:**
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Each croissant is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet long.
   - Bill bakes 120 croissants, so the total length of the croissants is \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.

3. **Length of the baguettes:**
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes is \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

4. **Total length of all baked goods:**
   - Add the lengths of the rolls, croissants, and baguettes: \( 100 + 60 + 120 = 280 \) feet.

The total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end is 280 feet.

- Total distance Blake runs: \( 15 \times 200 = 3000 \) yards.

**Kelly's Distance:**
- Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field.
- Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards each way (40 yards there and 40 yards back).
- She does this 34 times.
- Total distance for the 40-yard line runs: \( 34 \times 80 = 2720 \) yards.
- Adding the initial 100-yard run: \( 2720 + 100 = 2820 \) yards.

**Difference in Distance:**
- Blake's total distance: 3000 yards.

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial price and the increase rate:**
   - Initial price of the bag of marbles: $20
   - Increase rate: 20% of the original price every two months

2. **Determine the number of price increases over 36 months:**
   - Since the price increases every two months, the number of increases in 36 months is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \).

3. **Calculate the price after each increase:**
   - Each increase is 20% of the original price, which is \( 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \) dollars.
   - The price after each increase is the original price plus the increase amount, but since the increase is always based on the original price, the price after each increase is \( 20 + 4 = 24 \) dollars.

4. **Apply the increase 18 times:**
   - The price after 18 increases is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = 20 + 18 \times 4
     \]
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = 20 + 72 = 92

"Let's denote Seth's current age as \( S \) and Brooke's current age as \( B \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

We can simplify the second equation:
\[ S + 2 + B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):

"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to first calculate their total revenue and then their total costs, including the cost of lemons.

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They made a profit of $25.
   - Let's denote the total revenue as \( R \) and the total cost as \( C \).
   - The profit formula is: \( \text{Profit} = R - C \).
   - Given that the profit is $25, we have: \( 25 = R - C \).

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The cost to make one gallon of lemonade is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, which totals $5 per gallon.
   - Let \( G \) be the number of gallons they made.
   - The total cost \( C \) is then \( 5G \).

3. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon.
   - The revenue from one gallon is \( 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \) dollars.
   - The total revenue \( R \) is then \( 10G \).

4. **Set up the profit equation:**
   - Substitute \( R \) and \( C \) into the profit equation: \( 25 = 10G - 5G \).
   - Simplify the equation: \( 25 = 5G \).
   - Solve for \( G \): \( G = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) gallons.

5. **Calculate the cost of lemons:**
   - The cost of lemons per gallon is $3.
   - For 5 gallons, the total cost of lemons is \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) dollars.

Therefore, the amount spent on lemons is:

"To solve this problem, let's break down Zaid's expenses and calculate the remaining amount step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount spent on rent:**
   Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount spent on car fuel:**
   Zaid spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining after rent and car fuel} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount donated to charity:**
   Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation to charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining amount after the donation:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining after donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total amount given to his daughter and wife:**
   Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars.
   \[
   \text{Total given to family} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Calculate the final remaining amount:**
   \[
   \text{Final remaining amount} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, after all these expenses and donations, Zaid will still have 350 dollars.

"To find out how much Lloyd earned for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, Lloyd tutored for 5 hours at a rate of $10 per hour. So, his earnings for the first week are:
5 hours * $10/hour = $50

For the second week, Lloyd tutored for 8 hours at the same rate of $10 per hour. So, his earnings for the second week are:
8 hours * $10/hour = $80

Now, we add the earnings from both weeks to find the total:
$50 + $80 = $130

Therefore, Lloyd earned $130 for the first two weeks.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the ages:**
   - Jan's current age is 30.
   - Let Mark's current age be \( M \).
   - Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's current age is \( M + 2 \).

2. **Two years ago:**
   - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
   - Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).

3. **Set up the equation based on the given information:**
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago is \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).
   - Therefore, \( M - 2 = 14 + 5 \).

4. **Solve for \( M \):**
   \[
   M - 2 = 19
   \]
   \[
   M = 19 + 2
   \]
   \[
   M = 21
   \]

5. **Determine Jean's age:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark.
   - Jean's age is \( M + 2 = 21 + 2 = 23 \).

So, Jean is 23 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then determine how much more likely one event is compared to the other, expressed as a percentage.

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
   - The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - The probability is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).

2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \).
   - Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is \( 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \).

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 0.5.
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.25.
   - To find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3, we calculate the ratio of the two probabilities and then convert it to a percentage:
     \[
     \text{Ratio} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2
     \]
   - This means it is 2 times more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
   - To express this as a percentage, we calculate:
     \[
     (2 - 1) \times 100\% = 1 \times 100\% = 100\%
     \]

Therefore, it is 100% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"To find out how many rats are in each cage, we need to break down the information given and solve the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total straw used for the hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = 10 cages * 5 pieces/cage = 50 pieces of straw.

2. **Calculate the total straw used for the rabbits:**
   - There is a pen of rabbits with 20 pieces of straw distributed among them.

3. **Calculate the total straw used for the rats:**
   - The total straw distributed among all the small rodents is 160 pieces.
   - Straw used for hamsters and rabbits = 50 pieces (hamsters) + 20 pieces (rabbits) = 70 pieces.
   - Straw used for rats = 160 pieces (total) - 70 pieces (hamsters and rabbits) = 90 pieces.

4. **Determine the number of rats:**
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Number of rats = Total straw for rats / Straw per rat = 90 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 15 rats.

5. **Determine the number of rats per cage:**
   - The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups.
   - Number of rats per cage = Total number of rats / Number of cages = 15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats per cage.

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is 5.

"To determine the number of bags the trader sold, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue, and then use the profit to find the number of bags.

1. **Cost per bag**: The cost to the trader for each bag is the purchase price plus the transportation cost, which is $20 + $2 = $22 per bag.

2. **Selling price per bag**: The trader sells each bag for $30.

3. **Profit per bag**: The profit made on each bag is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $30 - $22 = $8 per bag.

4. **Total profit**: The trader made a total profit of $400.

5. **Number of bags sold**: To find the number of bags sold, we divide the total profit by the profit per bag:
   \[
   \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total profit}}{\text{Profit per bag}} = \frac{400}{8} = 50

"To find out how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide that total by the number of friends.

1. **Cost of tickets**: They spent $20.25 on 3 tickets.
2. **Cost of food**: They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets, so the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.
3. **Cost of rides**: They went on 2 different rides, each costing $33, so the total cost for the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost of tickets: $20.25
- Total cost of food: $15.75
- Total cost of rides: $66

Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102

"To determine how many trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the net number of trees Tom plants each year.
2. Determine the total number of trees after 10 years.
3. Calculate the number of trees that die after 10 years.
4. Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees to find the final number of trees.

Step 1: Net number of trees planted each year
Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year, so the net number of trees he adds each year is:
10 - 2 = 8 trees

Step 2: Total number of trees after 10 years
Starting with 50 trees, after 10 years, the total number of trees will be:
50 + (8 * 10) = 50 + 80 = 130 trees

Step 3: Number of trees that die after 10 years
30% of the trees die, so the number of trees that die is:
30% of 130 = 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees

Step 4: Final number of trees
Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees:
130 - 39 = 91 trees

"To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate his earnings from both publishers and then sum them up.

1. First, we know that Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher. Since he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B.

2. Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, for 500 sentences, Mark earns:
   \[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

3. Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, which is 10 cents per sentence. Therefore, for 500 sentences, Mark earns:
   \[ 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

4. To find the total earnings, we add the earnings from both publishers:

First, let's identify the lowest score among the first five tests:
- Scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86
- The lowest score is 71.

Next, we calculate the total points needed for an average of 93 over the five highest scores:
- The formula for the average is: \(\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total Points}}{\text{Number of Tests}}\)
- We want the average to be 93 over 5 tests, so:
  \[
  93 = \frac{\text{Total Points}}{5}
  \]
- Solving for Total Points:
  \[
  \text{Total Points} = 93 \times 5 = 465
  \]

Now, we need to find out how many points Brinley has from the four highest scores of the first five tests:
- The four highest scores are: 89, 92, 100, 86
- Sum of these scores:
  \[
  89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367
  \]

To find the required score on the sixth test, we need the total points from the five highest scores to be 465:
- Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test.
- The total points from the five highest scores will be:
  \[
  367 + x
  \]
- We need this to equal 465:
  \[
  367 + x = 465
  \]
- Solving for \( x \):
  \[
  x = 465 - 367 = 98
  \]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 98 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing the lowest score.

"To find out how many kilometers Michael rode in total, we can break the problem into two parts: the distance he rode in the first four weeks and the distance he rode in the following three weeks.

For the first four weeks:
- He rides 5 times a week.
- Each ride is 25 kilometers.
- So, each week he rides \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rides \(125 \times 4 = 500\) kilometers.

For the next three weeks:
- He rides 2 times a week.
- Each ride is 60 kilometers.
- So, each week he rides \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rides \(120 \times 3 = 360\) kilometers.

Adding the distances from both periods gives us the total distance:
- Total distance = \(500 + 360 = 860\) kilometers.

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40g. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars * 40g/chocolate bar = 1000g

Next, we are told that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. Therefore, the weight of each candied apple is:
40g / 2 = 20g

Since there are 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 candied apples * 20g/candied apple = 1600g

Now, we can find the total weight of the bag by adding the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples:
1000g (chocolate bars) + 1600g (candied apples) = 2600g

Therefore, Joe's bag of candy weighs 2600 grams.

"To find out how many cakes Rose bought after all three days, let's break down the problem:

1. On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
2. On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.
3. On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

Now, we add up the cakes bought each day to find the total:

- Monday: 4 cakes
- Tuesday: 12 cakes
- Wednesday: 60 cakes

Total cakes bought = \(4 + 12 + 60 = 76\)

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates is 6 plates.
   - Total cost for 6 plates = 6 * $6000 = $36,000.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Cost of twenty dozen cups = $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800.

3. **Determine the cost per cup:**
   - Twenty dozen cups is equivalent to 20 * 12 = 240 cups.
   - Cost per cup = Total cost of twenty dozen cups / Number of cups
   - Cost per cup = $34,800 / 240 = $145.

The total cost of buying each cup is $145.

"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20. Since she wants 2 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is:
2 pairs * $20/pair = $40

The total cost for the jacket and shoes is:
$30 (jacket) + $40 (shoes) = $70

Sara already has $10 saved, so the remaining amount she needs to save is:
$70 (total cost) - $10 (already saved) = $60

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so her earnings from babysitting are:
4 times * $5/time = $20

Adding her babysitting earnings to her savings, she has:
$10 (initial savings) + $20 (babysitting earnings) = $30

The remaining amount she needs to save is:
$70 (total cost) - $30 (current savings) = $40

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to save the remaining $40, we divide the remaining amount by her earnings per lawn mowed:
$40 / $4/lawn = 10

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of eggs collected each day is 42.
2. There are two more white chickens than red chickens.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:

1. The total number of eggs produced by the red and white chickens is 42:
   \[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

2. The number of white chickens is two more than the number of red chickens:
   \[ W = R + 2 \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( R \):

\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length (L) = 6 miles
- Width (W) = 1.5 miles

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know the total distance Gary walks is 15 miles. To find out how long it takes him to walk this distance, we use the formula for time (T), which is:

\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Given Gary's walking speed is 3 miles per hour, we can calculate the time:

\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park.

"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of customers on the first day: 100 customers.
2. Calculate the number of customers on the second day: 100 customers (first day) + 50 more customers = 150 customers.
3. Calculate the total number of customers over the first two days: 100 customers (first day) + 150 customers (second day) = 250 customers.
4. The total number of customers by the end of the third day is 500.
5. To find the number of customers on the third day, subtract the total number of customers from the first two days from the total number of customers by the end of the third day: 500 customers (total) - 250 customers (first two days) = 250 customers.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( B \) be the amount of water in the big pool now, and \( S \) be the amount of water in the small pool now. Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the big pool was \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons, and the amount of water in the small pool was \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

First, substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Since she earns $8.00 per hour, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ 352.00 \div 8.00 = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will need to work 44 hours to make her purchase.

"To determine Janeth's remaining balance after paying $165 a month for 12 months, we first need to calculate the total amount she owes, including the 10% interest.

1. Calculate the total amount to be paid back:
   - Principal amount: $2000
   - Interest: 10% of $2000 = 0.10 * $2000 = $200
   - Total amount to be paid back: $2000 + $200 = $2200

2. Calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months:
   - Monthly payment: $165
   - Total payments over 12 months: $165 * 12 = $1980

3. Calculate the remaining balance:
   - Total amount owed: $2200
   - Total amount paid: $1980

"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we first need to determine the number of dahlias. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses and there are 4 roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, to find the total number of flowers in the vase, we add the number of roses to the number of dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's current age is given as 21 years.
2. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age. Therefore, Adrian's current age is:
   \[
   3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack. Therefore, Zack's current age is:
   \[
   2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years}
   \]

Next, we need to calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years will be:
  \[
  21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years}
  \]
- Adrian's age in three years will be:
  \[
  63 + 3 = 66 \text{ years}
  \]
- Zack's age in three years will be:
  \[
  42 + 3 = 45 \text{ years}
  \]

Now, we calculate the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \text{ years}

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna, and then subtract the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the overall total of 251 points.

1. Naomi's score is given as 68 points.
2. Yuri's score is 10 more than half of Naomi's score. Half of Naomi's score is \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \), so Yuri's score is \( 34 + 10 = 44 \) points.
3. Brianna's score is 17 points more than Naomi's score, so Brianna's score is \( 68 + 17 = 85 \) points.

Now, we add up the scores of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\( 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \) points.

Finally, we subtract this sum from the total points to find Jojo's score:
\( 251 - 197 = 54 \) points.

Jojo scored 54 points.

"To find out how much time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on each type of puzzle and then add them together.

For the crossword puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- So, the time spent on crossword puzzles is 10 minutes/puzzle * 3 puzzles = 30 minutes.

For the sudoku puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.
- So, the time spent on sudoku puzzles is 5 minutes/puzzle * 8 puzzles = 40 minutes.

Now, we add the time spent on both types of puzzles:
- Total time spent = time spent on crossword puzzles + time spent on sudoku puzzles
- Total time spent = 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes.

Therefore, Carmen spent 70 minutes playing these games over the weekend.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The initial amount of water in the tank is 120 liters.
2. Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank, so the amount of water left in the tank is:
   \[ 120 \text{ liters} - 90 \text{ liters} = 30 \text{ liters} \]

3. Celine then collected rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. The amount of rainwater collected is:
   \[ 2 \times 30 \text{ liters} = 60 \text{ liters} \]

4. The total amount of water in the tank now is the sum of the water left after Celine used some and the rainwater collected:
   \[ 30 \text{ liters} + 60 \text{ liters} = 90 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the final amount of water in the tank is 90 liters.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the initial pens Ram buys and the additional pens he can create by mixing the ink from the empty ones.

1. Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. After using these 25 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen. So, from the 25 empty pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.
3. After using these 5 new pens, he will have 5 more empty pens, which he can again mix to make 1 more pen.
4. After using this 1 pen, he will have 1 more empty pen, but he won't have enough to make another pen since he needs 5 empty pens to make one new pen.

"To determine how many hours Mike spends writing letters each week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pen pals Mike is currently writing to:
   - Mike originally had 5 pen pals.
   - He stopped writing to 2 of them.
   - Therefore, he is now writing to \(5 - 2 = 3\) pen pals.

2. Determine the number of letters Mike receives each week:
   - Each of the 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week.
   - Therefore, Mike receives \(3 \times 2 = 6\) letters a week.

3. Calculate the total number of pages Mike receives each week:
   - Each letter is 5 pages long.
   - Therefore, Mike receives \(6 \times 5 = 30\) pages a week.

4. Determine the number of pages Mike writes in response:
   - Mike responds in kind, so he writes 30 pages a week.

5. Calculate the time Mike spends writing each week:
   - Mike can write a page every 6 minutes.
   - Therefore, to write 30 pages, he spends \(30 \times 6 = 180\) minutes.

6. Convert the time spent writing from minutes to hours:
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries from Griffin, so Griffin has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. So, Griffin now has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took, which is \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. So, Griffin now has \(9 - 2 = 7\) fries left.
5. Ginger gives Griffin some fries, and in the end, Griffin has 27 fries.

To find out how many fries Ginger gave Griffin, we need to determine the difference between the number of fries Griffin had after Colby took some and the number of fries Griffin had at the end:

\[ 27 - 7 = 20 \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of snails in each aquarium:**
   - Aquarium 1: 4 snails
   - Aquarium 2: 32 snails

2. **Calculate the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums:**
   - Difference = 32 snails - 4 snails = 28 snails

3. **Understand the relationship between the difference in snails and the number of fish:**
   - The difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.

4. **Set up the equation:**
   - Let \( f \) be the number of fish in each aquarium.
   - Total number of fish in both aquariums = \( 2f \)
   - According to the problem, 28 = 2 * (2f)

5. **Solve for \( f \):**
   - 28 = 4f
   - \( f = \frac{28}{4} \)
   - \( f = 7 \)

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To find out how much Jean paid for the makeup artist's services, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily cost of the makeup artist's services.
2. Calculate the weekly cost of the makeup artist's services.
3. Calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks.
4. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.

Step 1: Daily cost
The makeup artist charges $250 per hour and it takes 6 hours to do the makeup each day.
Daily cost = $250/hour * 6 hours = $1500

Step 2: Weekly cost
The makeup is needed 4 times a week.
Weekly cost = $1500/day * 4 days = $6000

Step 3: Total cost for 5 weeks
The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
Total cost = $6000/week * 5 weeks = $30,000

Step 4: Apply the 10% discount
The makeup artist gives a 10% discount.
Discount amount = 10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000

Final amount paid by Jean after the discount:
Final amount = Total cost - Discount amount = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of cows in all the stalls before and after Mr. Sylas buys and distributes the additional cows.

Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each:
\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and distributes them equally among the 20 stalls. Since there are 20 stalls, the number of additional cows per stall is:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, each stall has:
\[ 20 \text{ original cows} + 2 \text{ new cows} = 22 \text{ cows/stall} \]

To find the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:

"To determine the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of its wood, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it.
2. Determine the weight of the wood that the termites ate.
3. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the original total weight to find the current weight of the tree.

First, we calculate the total weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate any of it. The tree is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. 

\[ \text{Total weight before termites} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} \]
\[ \text{Total weight before termites} = 20 \times 400 \]
\[ \text{Total weight before termites} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the weight of the wood that the termites ate, which is 30% of the total weight.

\[ \text{Weight of wood eaten by termites} = 0.30 \times 8000 \]
\[ \text{Weight of wood eaten by termites} = 2400 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we subtract the weight of the wood eaten by the termites from the original total weight to find the current weight of the tree.

\[ \text{Current weight of the tree} = 8000 - 2400 \]
\[ \text{Current weight of the tree} = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

   - Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies, we can set up a proportion to find out how much flour is needed for 36 cookies.
   - \( \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{36 \text{ cookies}} \)
   - Solving for \( x \):
     - \( x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 36 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} \)
     - \( x = \frac{72}{12} \)
     - \( x = 6 \text{ cups} \)

2. Calculate the flour needed for 30 cookies:
   - Using the same proportion:
   - \( \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{y \text{ cups}}{30 \text{ cookies}} \)
   - Solving for \( y \):
     - \( y = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 30 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} \)
     - \( y = \frac{60}{12} \)
     - \( y = 5 \text{ cups} \)

- The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
- The collar takes a tenth of the body, which is \(900 / 10 = 90\) stitches.
- The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is \(90 \times 2 = 180\) stitches.
- The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[ 900 \text{ (body)} + 90 \text{ (collar)} + 180 \text{ (rosette)} = 1170 \text{ stitches} \]

The remaining stitches are for the two sleeves:
\[ 1800 \text{ (total)} - 1170 \text{ (body, collar, rosette)} = 630 \text{ stitches} \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches per sleeve is:
\[ 630 \text{ stitches} / 2 = 315 \text{ stitches} \]

Each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add those two amounts together.

The cost for the tomato seeds is calculated as follows:
20 packets * $40 per packet = $800

The cost for the celery seeds is calculated as follows:
80 packets * $30 per packet = $2400

Now, we add the two amounts together to get the total cost:
$800 + $2400 = $3200

Therefore, Mrs. Rylan used $3200 to buy the seeds.

"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to break down the information given and calculate the lines for each part of his role.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The song has 54 lines in the lyrics.
   - All 54 lines are his to memorize.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song.
   - The song has 54 lines, so the first scene has \( 2 \times 54 = 108 \) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - Therefore, Sean's lines in the first scene are \( \frac{108}{3} = 36 \) lines.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the song.
   - The song has 54 lines, so the second scene has \( 54 + 6 = 60 \) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - Therefore, Sean's lines in the second scene are \( \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \) lines.

Now, we sum up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
- Lines from the song: 54
- Lines from the first scene: 36
- Lines from the second scene: 48

Total lines Sean has to memorize:
\[ 54 + 36 + 48 = 138 \]

"To find out how many cards had the letter D on them, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of cards with the letter A.
2. Calculate the number of remaining cards after the A cards are taken out.
3. Calculate the number of cards with the letter B from the remaining cards.
4. Calculate the number of remaining cards after the B cards are taken out.
5. Calculate the number of cards with the letter C from the remaining cards.
6. The rest of the cards will have the letter D.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Number of cards with the letter A:
   \( \frac{2}{5} \) of 80 cards = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \) cards

2. Number of remaining cards after A cards:
   80 cards - 32 cards = 48 cards

3. Number of cards with the letter B:
   \( \frac{1}{2} \) of 48 cards = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \) cards

4. Number of remaining cards after B cards:
   48 cards - 24 cards = 24 cards

5. Number of cards with the letter C:
   \( \frac{5}{8} \) of 24 cards = \( \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \) cards

6. Number of remaining cards with the letter D:
   24 cards - 15 cards = 9 cards

So, the number of cards with the letter D on them is 9.

"To find out how many hours it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we first need to calculate the total time in minutes and then convert that to hours.

For the small holes:
- It takes 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
- For 30 small holes, it will take 30 * 3 = 90 minutes.

For the large holes:
- It takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
- For 15 large holes, it will take 15 * 10 = 150 minutes.

Now, we add the time for the small holes and the large holes to get the total time in minutes:
- Total time = 90 minutes (small holes) + 150 minutes (large holes) = 240 minutes.

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
- Total time in hours = 240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours.

"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we start with the sum of their current ages, which is 20. In 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older. Therefore, we add 10 years to each of their current ages, which is equivalent to adding 20 years to the sum of their current ages.

So, the calculation is:
20 (current sum of their ages) + 20 (10 years for each person) = 40

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \)
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and this is twice as many as a mamba, a mamba has:

70 spots / 2 = 35 spots

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras:

40 cobras * 70 spots/cobra = 2800 spots

Then, we calculate the total number of spots for all the mambas:

60 mambas * 35 spots/mamba = 2100 spots

Now, we add the total number of spots for both the cobras and the mambas to get the combined total:

2800 spots + 2100 spots = 4900 spots

Finally, we need to find half the number of spots they all have combined:

4900 spots / 2 = 2450 spots

"To determine how many dollars Maddy will spend on pizza, we need to calculate the total number of people and then the number of pizzas required.

1. Calculate the total number of people:
   - There are 12 team members.
   - Each team member brings 2 guests, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 guests.
   - There are 3 coaches.
   - Total number of people = 12 (team members) + 24 (guests) + 3 (coaches) = 39 people.

2. Calculate the number of pizzas needed:
   - Each pizza serves 3 people.
   - Number of pizzas needed = 39 people / 3 people per pizza = 13 pizzas.

3. Calculate the total cost:
   - Each pizza costs $15.
   - Total cost = 13 pizzas * $15 per pizza = $195.

Therefore, Maddy will spend $195 on pizza.

"To determine how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we first need to calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones and then find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads.

1. **Calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones:**
   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
   - Total length of topaz gemstones = 8 gemstones * 1 inch/gemstone = 8 inches.

2. **Determine the remaining length for the sterling silver beads:**
   - The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
   - Length occupied by topaz gemstones is 8 inches.
   - Remaining length for sterling silver beads = 25 inches - 8 inches = 17 inches.

3. **Calculate the number of sterling silver beads:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long.
   - Number of sterling silver beads = Remaining length / Length of one bead = 17 inches / 0.25 inches/ bead = 68 beads.

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. In the second week, they each doubled their output:

- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

To find the total number of stories written over the two weeks, we add the stories from both weeks:

- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories

Adding these totals together gives us the overall total:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has before buying the can of pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. Each quarter is worth 25 cents, and each dime is worth 10 cents.

The total value of the quarters is:
5 quarters * 25 cents/quarter = 125 cents

The total value of the dimes is:
2 dimes * 10 cents/dime = 20 cents

So, the total amount of money Kelly has is:
125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents

Now, let's subtract the cost of the can of pop, which is 55 cents, from the total amount of money Kelly has.

145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents

Kelly will have 90 cents left after buying the can of pop.

"To find out how many rows of 5 stars there are on the flag, we can start by calculating the total number of stars in the rows that are not 5-star rows.

There are three rows of 8 stars each, so:
3 rows * 8 stars/row = 24 stars

There are two rows of 6 stars each, so:
2 rows * 6 stars/row = 12 stars

Now, we can add the stars from the 8-star rows and the 6-star rows to find the total number of stars that are not in the 5-star rows:
24 stars + 12 stars = 36 stars

The flag has 76 stars in total, so the number of stars in the 5-star rows is:
76 stars - 36 stars = 40 stars

Since each of the 5-star rows contains 5 stars, the number of 5-star rows is:
40 stars / 5 stars/row = 8 rows

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip, we first need to calculate the total weight of the 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight is:

80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to carry this total weight, given that each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds. We divide the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks

Since you can't have a fraction of a truck, and the result is a whole number, exactly 3 trucks are needed to transport all 80 flagstones in one trip.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles, given its speed.

1. First, we find the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed:
   \[
   \text{Speed of the slow lane car} = \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour}
   \]

2. Next, we use the formula for time, which is:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]
   We know the distance is 480 miles and the speed of the slow lane car is 30 miles/hour:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is 16 hours.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of medals Izzy has:**
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali.
   - Therefore, Izzy has \( 22 - 5 = 17 \) medals.

2. **Calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:**
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 17 medals.
   - Together, they have \( 22 + 17 = 39 \) medals.

3. **Determine the total number of medals given out for counting:**
   - According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out.
   - Let \( T \) be the total number of medals given out.
   - Therefore, \( 39 = \frac{T}{10} \).

4. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - Multiply both sides of the equation by 10 to isolate \( T \):
   - \( T = 39 \times 10 = 390 \).

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390.

Next, we need to determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get in total. There are 4 adults, and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars/adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, and these 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them, so each child will get:

"Let's break down the points each player has after the third round and then calculate the points after the fourth round.

After 3 rounds:
- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

In the fourth round, each player with over 20 points gets an extra point:
- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point, and his total remains 18 points.
- Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points for all three players after the fourth round:

"To find out how much money Elise earned in the second year, we need to determine how many books she sold in that year and then multiply that number by the price per book.

First, let's find out how many books she sold in total over the three years. Since there are 50 unsold books out of the original 250, she has sold:

250 books - 50 unsold books = 200 sold books

We know that in the current year (the third year), she sold 45 books. We also know that in the first year, she sold twice as many books as in the third year. So, in the first year, she sold:

2 * 45 books = 90 books

Now we can calculate how many books were sold in the second year by subtracting the number of books sold in the first and third years from the total number of books sold:

200 sold books - 90 books (first year) - 45 books (third year) = 65 books (second year)

Now, to find out how much money she earned in the second year, we multiply the number of books sold in the second year by the price per book:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.
2. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning:
   \[

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much weight Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can calculate the weekly weight loss for Joey as follows:

\[ \text{Joey's weekly weight loss} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Therefore, Sandy's weekly weight loss is:

\[ \text{Sandy's weekly weight loss} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we use the following calculation:

\[ \text{Number of weeks for Sandy to lose 8 pounds} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \times 4 = 16 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

"To determine the total number of new limbs a person will grow after drinking Helena's Lots-of-Limbs Serum for fifteen days, we need to calculate the number of new arms and legs separately and then sum them up.

1. **New Arms:**
   - The serum causes a person to grow an extra arm every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of new arms is calculated by dividing 15 by 3.
   - \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \) new arms.

2. **New Legs:**
   - The serum causes a person to grow an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of new legs is calculated by dividing 15 by 5.
   - \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \) new legs.

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the new arms and new legs.
   - \( 5 \) new arms + \( 3 \) new legs = \( 8 \) new limbs.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 suits * $100/suit = $600

Next, the cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150

Now, the cost of the flight ticket:
$700 + (5 * $100) = $700 + $500 = $1200

Adding up all the expenses so far:
$600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight) = $1950

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the total amount he plans to spend and save is:
$6000 (total money) - $2000 (savings) = $4000

Subtracting the expenses from the amount he plans to spend:
$4000 - $1950 = $2050

Therefore, Theo has $2050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, Noah is now \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Six years ago, Noah was 20 years old, so the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60,000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half what it is now.
   - Therefore, the current population of Chile is \(60,000 \times 2 = 120,000\).

The population of Chile now is:

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \). According to the problem:

- The number of players on the offense is \( 2D \) (twice as many as on the defense).
- The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{1}{2}D \) (half the number on the defense).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3.5D = 105 \]

To find \( D \), we divide both sides by 3.5:

\[ D = \frac{105}{3.5} \]

\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to calculate the total amount of liquid added to the coffee, which includes both the ice cubes and the cream.

First, we calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, the number of ice cubes required is:

\[ \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Each ice cube adds 12 milliliters of water to the coffee, so the total amount of water added by the ice cubes is:

\[ \text{Water from ice cubes} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters} \]

Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream. Therefore, the total amount of liquid added to the coffee is:

\[ \text{Total liquid added} = 60 \text{ milliliters (from ice cubes)} + 15 \text{ milliliters (cream)} = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of junior and senior programmers and their respective salaries, and then calculate the total monthly payroll for all programmers.

1. **Determine the number of junior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees.
   - Number of junior programmers = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \).

2. **Determine the number of senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of senior programmers = Total employees - Number of junior programmers.
   - Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60.

3. **Determine the salary of senior programmers:**
   - Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month.
   - Each senior programmer is paid $400 more than each junior programmer.
   - Salary of each senior programmer = $2000 + $400 = $2400.

4. **Calculate the total monthly payroll for junior programmers:**
   - Total payroll for junior programmers = Number of junior programmers × Salary of each junior programmer.
   - Total payroll for junior programmers = 40 × $2000 = $80,000.

5. **Calculate the total monthly payroll for senior programmers:**
   - Total payroll for senior programmers = Number of senior programmers × Salary of each senior programmer.
   - Total payroll for senior programmers = 60 × $2400 = $144,000.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many people got on the bus at the terminal.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.
2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the number of people on the bus is now \( x + 5 \).
3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 people got on. Therefore, the number of people on the bus is now \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

Simplifying the expression:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We know that after the second bus stop, there were 20 people on the bus. So we set up the equation:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chickens and cows Farmer Brown has, and then calculate the total number of legs.

Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( Ch \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of animals is 60.
2. The number of chickens is twice the number of cows.

We can set up the following equations based on the information given:

"To calculate the total number of legs for the restaurant's tables, we need to multiply the number of tables by the number of legs for each type of table and then add the results together.

For the 40 tables with 4 legs each:
40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs

For the 50 tables with 3 legs each:
50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs

Adding the two results together gives us the total number of legs:
160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs

"To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and her husband, and then subtract that from the total number of cookies in the bag.

1. Jenny's son gets 4 cookies a day for 5 days a week, so he eats:
   \( 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies/week} \)

2. Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days a week, so he eats:
   \( 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 7 \text{ cookies/week} \)

3. The total number of cookies eaten by her son and husband is:
   \( 20 \text{ cookies/week} + 7 \text{ cookies/week} = 27 \text{ cookies/week} \)

4. The bag contains 36 cookies, so the number of cookies Jenny eats is:
   \( 36 \text{ cookies} - 27 \text{ cookies} = 9 \text{ cookies} \)

Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To find out how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts with a 40% discount, we first need to calculate the total cost of the shirts without the discount and then apply the discount.

The cost of one shirt is $30, so the cost of two shirts is:
2 * $30 = $60

The discount is 40%, so the discount amount on the total cost is:
40% of $60 = 0.40 * $60 = $24

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Davos paid:
$60 - $24 = $36

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

"To find out how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to first determine the total time he spent on vacation. We know that the time he spent watching shows (3 shows at 2 hours each) is 30% of his total vacation time.

First, calculate the total time spent watching shows:
3 shows * 2 hours/show = 6 hours

Since this is 30% of his total vacation time, we can set up the equation:
6 hours = 30% of total time

To find the total time, we solve for the total time:
6 hours = 0.30 * total time
total time = 6 hours / 0.30
total time = 20 hours

Now, we know that he spent 40% of his time sightseeing. To find the time spent sightseeing, we calculate:
40% of 20 hours = 0.40 * 20 hours = 8 hours

So, John spent 8 hours sightseeing.

"To find the height of the tallest tree, let's first determine the heights of the other two trees.

The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet.

The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so its height is:
6 feet + 5 feet = 11 feet

The combined height of the shortest and the second tree is:
6 feet + 11 feet = 17 feet

The tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree, so its height is:
2 * 17 feet = 34 feet

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is 34 feet.

"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \).

According to the problem, Carver is 5 years less than twice his son's age. This can be written as:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the train travels in one complete trip between the three cities, then multiply that by the number of trips it makes in a day, and finally determine how many days it can operate before reaching the 18,000-mile service interval.

1. Calculate the distance from the third city to the first city:
   - The combined distance from the first city to the second and then to the third is 75 miles + 100 miles = 175 miles.
   - The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than 175 miles, which is 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles.

2. Calculate the total distance for one complete trip:
   - The total distance for one trip is the sum of the distances between all cities: 75 miles + 100 miles + 125 miles = 300 miles.

3. Calculate the total distance traveled in one day:
   - The train makes 3 trips a day, so the total distance traveled in one day is 300 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 900 miles/day.

4. Determine how many days the train can operate before needing service:
   - The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it can operate, divide the service interval by the daily distance: 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days.

The train goes 20 days between services.

"To determine the monthly payment Karan has to make, we first need to calculate the total interest on the loan and then the total amount to be repaid, which includes both the principal and the interest. After that, we divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment.

1. **Calculate the interest:**
   The formula for simple interest is:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   Here, the principal (P) is $3,650, the rate (R) is 10% or 0.10, and the time (T) is 5 months, which is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of a year.

   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 = 152.08
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} = 3650 + 152.08 = 3802.08
   \]

3. **Calculate the monthly payment:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}} = \frac{3802.08}{5} = 760.42

"To determine Millie's profit per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with her supplies.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling all the lemonade.
3. Calculate the total profit by subtracting the cost of supplies from the total revenue.
4. Determine the total time it takes to sell all the lemonade.
5. Calculate the profit per hour.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of cups of lemonade.**

Millie can make 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups:
\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling all the lemonade.**

Each cup is sold for $1:
\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total profit.**

The cost of supplies is $18:
\[ \text{Total profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Cost of supplies} \]
\[ \text{Total profit} = \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

**Step 4: Determine the total time it takes to sell all the lemonade.**

Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour:
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total number of cups}}{\text{Cups sold per hour}} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups/hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 5: Calculate the profit per hour.**

\[ \text{Profit per hour} = \frac{\text{Total profit}}{\text{Total time}} \]
\[ \text{Profit per hour} = \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \]

Therefore, Millie's profit per hour is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up the problem as follows:

Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially. According to the problem, he sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]

\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]

\[ x = 32 \]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26 girls

On the day of the performance, only the female members are performing, and half of them can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, the number of girls who can make it to the performance is:

Number of girls performing = 26 / 2 = 13 girls

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Number of people who sang = Number of girls performing + Number of teachers
Number of people who sang = 13 + 3 = 16

"To determine how much money David saves by buying a ride bracelet instead of individual ride tickets, we need to calculate the total cost for both David and Dasha and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Dasha, who buys individual ride tickets:
- Each ride costs 2 ride tickets.
- Each ride ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, each ride costs 2 * $2 = $4.
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is 9 * $4 = $36.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for David, who buys a ride bracelet:
- The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives access to all 9 rides.

Now, we find the difference in cost between Dasha's total and David's total to determine how much David saves:
- Dasha's total cost: $36
- David's total cost: $30
- David's savings: $36 - $30 = $6

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many popsicles each person has based on the given ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. Together, they have 5 + 6 = 11 parts of the total number of popsicles.

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find out how many popsicles each part represents by dividing the total number by the sum of the parts in the ratio:
\[ \text{Number of popsicles per part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"To determine how much money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to streaming services, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services and then subtract that from the cost of the cable package.

1. **Cost of Netflix**: $10 per month.
2. **Cost of Hulu and Disney Plus**:
   - Normally, each service costs $10 per month.
   - The total cost for both services without the discount is $10 + $10 = $20 per month.
   - With a 20% discount, the savings on the bundle is 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4.
   - Therefore, the discounted cost for the bundle is $20 - $4 = $16 per month.

3. **Total cost of streaming services**:
   - Netflix: $10
   - Hulu and Disney Plus bundle: $16
   - Total: $10 + $16 = $26 per month.

4. **Savings**:
   - Cost of cable package: $60 per month.
   - Cost of streaming services: $26 per month.
   - Savings: $60 - $26 = $34 per month.

Therefore, Tim saves $34 per month by cancelling his cable package and switching to streaming services.

"To find the percentage of time Carol spent editing her song out of her total work time, we first need to calculate the total time spent on all activities and then determine the proportion of that time that was spent editing.

1. Time spent writing the song: 4 hours
2. Time spent recording the song: 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
3. Time spent editing the song: 90 minutes, which is 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on all activities:
Total time = Time writing + Time recording + Time editing
Total time = 4 hours + 2 hours + 1.5 hours
Total time = 7.5 hours

Next, we calculate the percentage of the total time that was spent editing:
Percentage of time spent editing = (Time editing / Total time) * 100
Percentage of time spent editing = (1.5 hours / 7.5 hours) * 100
Percentage of time spent editing = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of time spent editing = 20%

"To find out how many Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she started with and then subtract the number of cards she passed out and add the number of cards she received.

1. Erica made 20 Valentine's cards.
2. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards, with 15 cards each, so that's 2 * 15 = 30 cards.
3. The total number of cards Erica had initially is 20 (made) + 30 (pre-made) = 50 cards.
4. She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, so she passed out a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.
5. She received 17 cards from family and friends.

Now, we subtract the number of cards she passed out from the total number of cards she had and then add the number of cards she received:

50 (initial cards) - 29 (passed out) + 17 (received) = 38 cards.

So, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The pizza has 12 slices in total.
2. Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since 1/3 of 12 is 4, Bill gets 4 slices.
3. Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. Since 1/4 of 12 is 3, Mark gets 3 slices.
4. Jenny eats 2 slices herself.

Now, let's calculate the total number of slices given away and eaten:
- Slices given to Bill: 4
- Slices given to Mark: 3
- Slices eaten by Jenny: 2

Total slices given away and eaten: 4 + 3 + 2 = 9

"To find the total number of bugs Nancy counted, we need to calculate the number of each type of bug and then sum them up.

1. **Spiders**: Nancy saw 90 spiders.
2. **Millipedes**: The number of millipedes is 1/3rd the number of spiders. So, the number of millipedes is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
   \]
3. **Stink Bugs**: The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, the number of stink bugs is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48
   \]

Now, we add up all the bugs:
\[
90 \text{ (spiders)} + 30 \text{ (millipedes)} + 48 \text{ (stink bugs)} = 168

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much flour and milk Mark needs for a quadruple batch of brownies and then calculate how many bags of flour and bottles of milk he needs to buy, given the sizes of the packages.

First, let's calculate the total amount of flour and milk needed for a quadruple batch:

- The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour. For a quadruple batch, Mark needs:
  \( 3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups of flour} \)

- The normal recipe calls for 1 cup of milk. For a quadruple batch, Mark needs:
  \( 1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups of milk} \)

Next, we need to determine how many 2-cup bags of flour and 2-cup bottles of milk Mark needs to buy:

- Flour is sold in 2-cup bags. To get 12 cups of flour, Mark needs:
  \( \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bag}} = 6 \text{ bags of flour} \)

- Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles. To get 4 cups of milk, Mark needs:
  \( \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups per bottle}} = 2 \text{ bottles of milk} \)

Finally, we need to find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy:

"To determine how many kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days by reducing the time he uses the air conditioner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner:
   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour.
   - Mel uses it for 8 hours a day.
   - Daily energy consumption = 900 watts/hour * 8 hours/day = 7200 watt-hours/day.

2. Convert the daily energy consumption to kilowatt-hours (kWh):
   - 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) = 1000 watt-hours.
   - Daily energy consumption in kWh = 7200 watt-hours/day / 1000 = 7.2 kWh/day.

3. Calculate the energy consumption if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day:
   - New usage time = 8 hours/day - 5 hours/day = 3 hours/day.
   - New daily energy consumption = 900 watts/hour * 3 hours/day = 2700 watt-hours/day.
   - New daily energy consumption in kWh = 2700 watt-hours/day / 1000 = 2.7 kWh/day.

4. Calculate the daily energy savings:
   - Daily energy savings = 7.2 kWh/day - 2.7 kWh/day = 4.5 kWh/day.

5. Calculate the total energy savings over 30 days:
   - Total energy savings = 4.5 kWh/day * 30 days = 135 kWh.

Therefore, Mel will save 135 kilowatts of electric energy in 30 days.

"To determine how much Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we first need to calculate the number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people served per sandwich:

20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches, Tyson will need:

5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, and the cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound. So, the total cost for the meat and cheese is:

5 pounds of meat * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
5 pounds of cheese * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

Adding the cost of the meat and the cheese together gives us the total cost:

$35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

Therefore, Tyson would spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Quantities:**
   - Allan has 40 cannolis.
   - There is twice as much corn as cannolis, so the number of corns is \(2 \times 40 = 80\).

2. **After Buying More Cannolis:**
   - Allan buys 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).

3. **New Quantity of Corns:**
   - Allan now has 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Since he has 100 cannolis, the number of corns is \(100 - 40 = 60\).

4. **Combined Total:**
   - The combined total of corns and cannolis is \(100 + 60 = 160\).

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 160.

"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he has taken 5,000 steps. Additionally, he did another 1,000 steps walking with his friend. So, before his jog, he had taken a total of:

5,000 steps (to and from school) + 1,000 steps (with his friend) = 6,000 steps

After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. This means that after his jog, he had taken:

10,000 steps (goal) - 2,000 steps (left) = 8,000 steps

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we subtract the number of steps he had taken before his jog from the number of steps he had taken after his jog:

8,000 steps (after jog) - 6,000 steps (before jog) = 2,000 steps

So, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

"To find out how much Tim spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks after the discount and add the cost of the finale firework.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the two packages of fireworks before the discount:
- The first package costs $400.
- The second package costs twice as much as the first, so it costs $400 * 2 = $800.

The total cost of the two packages before the discount is:
$400 + $800 = $1200.

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the two packages:
- A 20% discount means he pays 80% of the total cost.
- 80% of $1200 is 0.80 * $1200 = $960.

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted total:
$960 + $150 = $1110.

Therefore, Tim spent a total of $1110 on fireworks.

1% of 50,000 candles = 0.01 * 50,000 = 500 candles

Next, we need to find out how many of these 500 exploding candles also smell like wet dog:
5% of 500 candles = 0.05 * 500 = 25 candles

So, 25 candles will both explode and smell like wet dog.

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we first need to calculate the discount amount and then apply it to the regular price of the blouses.

1. Calculate the discount per blouse:
   - The regular price of each blouse is $20.
   - The discount is 30%, so the discount amount per blouse is 30% of $20.
   - \( 0.30 \times 20 = 6 \) dollars.

2. Calculate the discounted price per blouse:
   - The discounted price per blouse is the regular price minus the discount amount.
   - \( 20 - 6 = 14 \) dollars.

3. Calculate the total cost for 4 blouses:
   - The total cost is the discounted price per blouse multiplied by the number of blouses.
   - \( 14 \times 4 = 56 \) dollars.

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
3. Joanne gathers an unknown number of apples from the average trees, let's call this number \( x \).

For her sister:
1. She gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
2. She gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
3. She gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ \text{Joanne's apples} + \text{Sister's apples} = 500 \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ (30 + 15 + x) + (60 + 45 + 0) = 500 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 45 + x + 105 = 500 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 500 - 150 \]
\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

Let \( c \) represent the number of camels and \( d \) represent the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 180.
2. The total number of humps is 304.

We can write these as:
\[ c + d = 180 \]
\[ 2c + d = 304 \]

We can solve this system of equations step by step.

First, subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( d \):
\[ (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2c + d - c - d = 124 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Now that we have \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[ 124 + d = 180 \]
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is 56.

"To find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we can break down the trip into segments and calculate the distance for each segment before summing them up.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Distance per day: 200 kilometers
   - Total distance for 4 days: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \)

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: 800 kilometers
   - Distance for the next 2 days: \( 30\% \) of 800 kilometers
   - \( 30\% \) of 800 km: \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \)

3. **Next 1 day:**
   - Distance traveled: 0 kilometers (he wasn't traveling at all)

4. **Second week (7 days):**
   - Distance per day: 300 kilometers
   - Total distance for 7 days: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \)

Now, we sum up the distances from all segments:
- First 4 days: 800 km
- Next 2 days: 240 km
- Next 1 day: 0 km
- Second week: 2100 km

Total distance: \( 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \)

"To find out how big Timothy's locker is, we can start by determining the size of Zack's locker based on the information given about Peter's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Peter's locker size} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Zack's locker size} \]

Given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can solve for Zack's locker size:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Zack's locker size} \]

Multiplying both sides by 4 to isolate Zack's locker size:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Now, we know that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so we can set up another equation:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Timothy's locker size} \]

Substituting the size of Zack's locker:

\[ 20 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Timothy's locker size} \]

Multiplying both sides by 2 to solve for Timothy's locker size:

\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the elevation where the comb landed.
2. Calculate the difference between Oliver's current elevation and the comb's elevation.

First, we know that Stanley was at an elevation of 10,000 feet and the comb fell 4,000 feet. Therefore, the comb landed at:
\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:
\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the comb.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, there are 50 cats on the rock.
2. Four boats came and each carried away 5 cats. So, the total number of cats carried away by the boats is \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cats.
3. After the boats have carried away 20 cats, the number of cats remaining on the rock is \(50 - 20 = 30\) cats.
4. Then, \(3/5\) of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. The number of cats that ran after the mouse is \(3/5 \times 30 = 18\) cats.
5. Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock after some ran after the mouse is \(30 - 18 = 12\) cats.

"To calculate the total cost of the streaming service for 2 years, we need to break down the costs into the different periods and then sum them up.

1. **First 6 months at $8 per month:**
   6 months * $8/month = $48

2. **Next 8 months at $12 per month:**
   8 months * $12/month = $96

3. **Remaining 10 months at $14 per month:**
   2 years = 24 months
   24 months - 6 months (first period) - 8 months (second period) = 10 months
   10 months * $14/month = $140

Now, we add up all the costs:
$48 + $96 + $140 = $284

The total cost for 2 years of the service is $284.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \( 28 - 6 = 22 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The rest of the savings, which is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars, came from the tattered jeans.

4. **Determine the original prices of the jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans were bought for $28 after a $4 savings, so the original price of the tattered jeans was \( 28 + 4 = 32 \) dollars.
   - The jogger jeans were bought for $22 after a $2 savings, so the original price of the jogger jeans was \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

5. **Determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:**
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $32.
   - The difference in original prices is \( 32 - 24 = 8 \) dollars.

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans.

"To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the bagel is given as $4.
2. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find the cost of the soup, we calculate 25% of $4 and add it to $4:
   \[ \text{Cost of soup} = 4 + (0.25 \times 4) = 4 + 1 = 5 \]
3. The cake costs half the price of the bagel. Therefore, the cost of the cake is:
   \[ \text{Cost of cake} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, we add the costs of the soup, bagel, and cake to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered.

"To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( C \).

Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards, so he sells 2/3 of his cards. The amount of money he makes from selling the cards is the number of cards he sells multiplied by the price per card, which is $1.5.

The money from selling the cards is:
\[ \text{Money from selling cards} = \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 \]

Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 left over, so the total amount of money he makes from selling the cards is $150.

So we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{3}C \times 1.5 = 150 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ \frac{2}{3}C = \frac{150}{1.5} \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}C = 100 \]
\[ C = \frac{100 \times 3}{2} \]
\[ C = 150 \]

Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The caterer was initially preparing for 36 guests.
2. He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. This means he prepared for 18 guests to have two hotdogs and the other 18 guests to have one hotdog.
3. The total number of hotdogs prepared is:
   - 18 guests * 2 hotdogs each = 36 hotdogs
   - 18 guests * 1 hotdog each = 18 hotdogs
   - Total = 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs

4. However, 40 guests showed up, and each wanted a second hotdog. This means each of the 40 guests wanted 2 hotdogs.
5. The total number of hotdogs needed for 40 guests, each having 2 hotdogs, is:
   - 40 guests * 2 hotdogs each = 80 hotdogs

6. The caterer only had 54 hotdogs prepared, so the number of hotdogs short is:
   - 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs

7. Since each guest who did not get a second hotdog is missing 1 hotdog, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 26.

"To find out how much Charlotte's order was after the 20% discount, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. 

The cost of the pot and pans is $120.00.
The cost of the mixing bowls is $20.00.
The cost of the 5 utensils is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

The total cost before the discount is:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

Now, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost:
20% of $165.00 is 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00.

Subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final amount:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

Therefore, Charlotte's order was $132.00.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the dimensions of the room in feet. Given that the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, 3 yards equals 9 feet.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

We know the area (360 square feet) and the length (9 feet), so we can solve for the width:
\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360}{9} \]
\[ \text{width} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the room. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ P = 2 \times (9 + 40) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 49 \]
\[ P = 98 \text{ feet} \]

The perimeter of the room is 98 feet.

   1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes

2. Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so the length of Movie B is:
   75 + 5 = 80 minutes

3. Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so the length of Movie A is:
   80 / 4 = 20 minutes

Therefore, Movie A is 20 minutes long.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the distance the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour.
2. Determine the amount of hay the horse will eat based on the distance run.
3. Calculate the cost of the hay.
4. Determine how much money Michael has and how much change he will have after buying the hay.

Step 1: Calculate the distance the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour.
- Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the distance the horse runs is:
  \[ \text{Distance} = 32 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 16 \, \text{miles} \]

Step 2: Determine the amount of hay the horse will eat based on the distance run.
- The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, so for 16 miles:
  \[ \text{Hay needed} = 16 \, \text{miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \, \text{bail/mile} = 8 \, \text{bails} \]

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the hay.
- Each bail of hay costs $3, so for 8 bails:
  \[ \text{Cost of hay} = 8 \, \text{bails} \times 3 \, \text{dollars/bail} = 24 \, \text{dollars} \]

Step 4: Determine how much money Michael has and how much change he will have after buying the hay.
- Michael has six 5 dollar bills, which totals:
  \[ \text{Total money} = 6 \times 5 \, \text{dollars} = 30 \, \text{dollars} \]
- The change after buying the hay is:
  \[ \text{Change} = 30 \, \text{dollars} - 24 \, \text{dollars} = 6 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of the Super Ticket**: $20
2. **Cost of the Movie Ticket**: $12
3. **Cost of the Soda**: $3
4. **Savings**: $2

If you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2, it means the total cost of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda was $2 less than the cost of the super ticket.

Let's denote the regular price of the popcorn as \( P \).

The total cost of buying the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda is:
\[ 12 + P + 3 \]

According to the problem, this total cost is $2 less than the cost of the super ticket:
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 20 - 2 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 15 + P = 18 \]

Solve for \( P \):
\[ P = 18 - 15 \]
\[ P = 3 \]

So, the regular price of the popcorn is \( \boxed{3} \)."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the original cost per balloon before the price increase. We know that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of balloons}} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \]

So, the original cost per balloon was $45.

After the price increase, the cost per balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price:

\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times 65 = 11050 \]

Thus, Bentley paid $11,050 to fill 170 balloons after the price increase.

"To determine the cost of the potting soil for Bob, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of one raised bed.
2. Multiply the volume of one raised bed by the number of beds to get the total volume of soil needed.
3. Determine how many bags of potting soil are required.
4. Calculate the total cost based on the number of bags needed.

Step 1: Calculate the volume of one raised bed.
The volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is calculated by multiplying the length by the width by the height.
Volume of one bed = 2 feet (width) * 8 feet (length) * 2 feet (height) = 32 cubic feet.

Step 2: Calculate the total volume of soil needed for all 10 raised beds.
Total volume = 32 cubic feet/bed * 10 beds = 320 cubic feet.

Step 3: Determine how many bags of potting soil are required.
Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil.
Number of bags needed = Total volume / Volume per bag = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags.

Step 4: Calculate the total cost.
Cost per bag = $12.
Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag = 160 bags * $12/bag = $1920.

The total cost for the potting soil is $1920.

"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

Total number of puppies = Jennifer's puppies + Brandon's puppies
Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Total number of puppies with spots = Jennifer's spotted puppies + Brandon's spotted puppies
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, to find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of spotted puppies} = \left( \frac{\text{Total number of spotted puppies}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of spotted puppies} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of spotted puppies} = 0.35 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of spotted puppies} = 35\% \]

"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then the total weight of all the feed combined.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds

2. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds

3. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds

4. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, we add up the total weight of all the feed:

- Total weight = 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats)
- Total weight = 4500 pounds

The farmer's truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

- Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
- Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip
- Number of trips = 2

Since the result is a whole number, the farmer will need exactly 2 trips to transport all the feed.

"To determine how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have five cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( c \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies, so we set the equation equal to 5:

\[ 5 = \frac{1}{2}c + 2 \]

To solve for \( c \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{1}{2}c \]
\[ 3 = \frac{1}{2}c \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( c \):

\[ 3 \times 2 = c \]
\[ 6 = c \]

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to calculate the number of blue and yellow paint tubes he has based on the information given about Ben's paint tubes.

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint. Since Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, we calculate:
Jasper's blue paint tubes = 4 / 2 = 2 tubes

Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint. Since Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, we calculate:
Jasper's yellow paint tubes = 3 * 3 = 9 tubes

Now, to find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we add the blue and yellow paint tubes together:
Total tubes of paint Jasper has = 2 (blue) + 9 (yellow) = 11 tubes

"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to determine the weight of the 2010 penny. Given that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight as follows:

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny
Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48 grains
Weight of 2010 penny = 36 grains

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding the weight of the 2010 penny to the weight of the 1959 penny:

Combined weight = Weight of 2010 penny + Weight of 1959 penny
Combined weight = 36 grains + 48 grains
Combined weight = 84 grains

"To find out how much more Keegan and Tashay need to earn to reach their goal, we first add the amounts that Keegan and Tashay have already earned:

Keegan's earnings: $83
Tashay's earnings: $91

Total earnings so far: $83 + $91 = $174

Their goal is to raise $200. To find out how much more they need to earn, we subtract their total earnings from their goal:

$200 - $174 = $26

So, Keegan and Tashay need to earn $26 more to reach their goal.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many songs Luri has on his player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we calculate:

Luri's songs = 3 * Gabriel's songs
Luri's songs = 3 * 20
Luri's songs = 60

Next, we need to find out how many more songs each can add to their players. The media players can store up to 100 songs.

For Gabriel:
Songs Gabriel can add = 100 - Gabriel's current songs
Songs Gabriel can add = 100 - 20
Songs Gabriel can add = 80

For Luri:
Songs Luri can add = 100 - Luri's current songs
Songs Luri can add = 100 - 60
Songs Luri can add = 40

Now, to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number Gabriel can add:

Fewer songs Luri can add = Songs Gabriel can add - Songs Luri can add
Fewer songs Luri can add = 80 - 40
Fewer songs Luri can add = 40

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many oranges Stetson ate. Since they picked 60 oranges and Stetson ate 2/5 of them, we calculate the number of oranges he ate as follows:

Number of oranges Stetson ate = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 60 \)

Now, we calculate the amount of money Stetson gave up. Since he gives up $10 for each orange he eats, the total amount of money he gave up is:

Total amount of money = Number of oranges Stetson ate \(\times\) $10

Let's do the calculations:

Number of oranges Stetson ate = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \)

Total amount of money = 24 \(\times\) $10 = $240

So, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is:

"To find out how many hours James runs a week, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week and then divide that by his running speed.

First, we calculate the total distance:
James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, so the total distance is:
12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Next, we calculate the total time he spends running:
Since he runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour, the time spent running is the total distance divided by his speed:
60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

So, James runs 6 hours a week.

"To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for five days, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the daily oats consumption for one horse:**
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, one horse consumes \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).

2. **Calculate the daily oats consumption for all four horses:**
   - There are 4 horses.
   - Therefore, the total daily consumption for all horses is \(10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).

3. **Calculate the total oats consumption for five days:**
   - The total consumption for 5 days is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).

4. **Determine the number of 50-pound bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.
   - The number of bags required is \(\frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags}\).

"To determine the cost per individual razor after the discount and coupon, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Cost of Razors Before Discount:**
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - Heather buys 2 packs, so the total cost before any discounts is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$8.00
     \]

2. **Buy One Get One Free Discount:**
   - With the buy one get one free offer, Heather gets 2 packs for the price of 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is:
     \[
     \$4.00
     \]

3. **Applying the Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - Subtract the coupon from the cost of 2 packs:

"To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to add up the heights of the cheerleaders, starting from the bottom and moving to the top.

The pyramid structure is as follows:
- 4 cheerleaders on the bottom
- 3 cheerleaders on the next level
- 2 cheerleaders on the next level
- 1 cheerleader at the top

Given that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall and the 10th is 60 inches tall, the shortest girl (60 inches) will be at the top.

The height of the pyramid is the sum of the heights of the cheerleaders, each standing on the shoulders of the ones below them. Since the height of a person standing on another's shoulders is approximately the sum of their heights, we can calculate the total height as follows:

- Bottom level: 4 cheerleaders at 64 inches each = 4 * 64 = 256 inches
- Second level: 3 cheerleaders at 64 inches each = 3 * 64 = 192 inches
- Third level: 2 cheerleaders at 64 inches each = 2 * 64 = 128 inches
- Top level: 1 cheerleader at 60 inches = 60 inches

Total height of the pyramid in inches:
256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 inches

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
636 / 12 = 53 feet

Therefore, the height of the human pyramid is 53 feet.

"To find out how much money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks, we need to calculate the cost of his morning and afternoon rides and then sum them up for the 14 days.

Each morning ride costs $6, and he does this twice a day, so the daily cost for morning rides is:
\[ 6 \text{ dollars/ride} \times 1 \text{ ride/morning} = 6 \text{ dollars/morning} \]

Each afternoon ride costs $2, and he does this twice a day, so the daily cost for afternoon rides is:
\[ 2 \text{ dollars/ride} \times 1 \text{ ride/afternoon} = 2 \text{ dollars/afternoon} \]

The total daily cost for both morning and afternoon rides is:
\[ 6 \text{ dollars/morning} + 2 \text{ dollars/afternoon} = 8 \text{ dollars/day} \]

Since he drives for 14 days, the total cost over the two weeks is:

"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up an equation where the total cost of each venue is the same.

Let \( x \) be the number of guests.

**Cost for the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per person
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost for the second venue:**
- Cost per person: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We set the total costs equal to each other to find the number of guests \( x \) where the costs are the same:

\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

"To solve this problem, let's set up some equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( B \) represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
2. David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found \( \frac{B}{2} \) insects.
3. Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( \frac{B}{2} + 7 \) insects.
4. Together, they found 43 insects, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   B + \frac{B}{2} + \left(\frac{B}{2} + 7\right) = 43
   \]

Now, let's simplify and solve for \( B \):

\[
B + \frac{B}{2} + \frac{B}{2} + 7 = 43
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
B + B + 7 = 43
\]

\[
2B + 7 = 43
\]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[
2B = 36
\]

Divide by 2:

\[
B = 18
\]

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find out how many David and Lily found:

- David found \( \frac{B}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) insects.
- Lily found \( \frac{B}{2} + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \) insects.

So, Lily found 16 insects.

"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to add the fractions of the skein they each used and then multiply by the total number of yards in a skein.

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein. First, we add these fractions:

1/4 + 1/2 = 1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4

This means they used 3/4 of a skein of yarn together. Now, we need to find out how many yards 3/4 of a skein is. Since there are 364 yards in a full skein, we multiply 364 by 3/4:

364 * 3/4 = 364 * 0.75 = 273

So, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.

"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah will need to drink, we first need to calculate the total distance she will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she needs to run 8 laps, we can calculate the total distance as follows:

Total distance = Number of laps × Distance per lap
Total distance = 8 laps × 0.25 km/lap
Total distance = 2 km

Now that we know the total distance, we can calculate the amount of water she needs to drink. Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs, so:

Total water needed = Total distance × Water per kilometer
Total water needed = 2 km × 60 ml/km
Total water needed = 120 ml

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water.

"First, let's calculate how much Julie spent on clothes. She spent 20% of $500 on clothes:

20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

So, after buying clothes, Julie has:

$500 - $100 = $400

Next, she spends 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs:

25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

So, after buying CDs, Julie has:

$400 - $100 = $300

Therefore, Julie has $300 left.

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem:
1. The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000.
2. The house costs three times as much as the lot.

We can express these relationships with the following equations:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]
\[ H = 3L \]

Now, substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Next, solve for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house:
\[ H = 3L \]
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the cost of the house is $90,000.

"To calculate Tara's profit, we need to determine her total cost and her total revenue, then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

1. **Total Cost**: Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags, so she bought a total of \(8 \times 5 = 40\) bags. Each bag cost her $4, so her total cost is \(40 \times 4 = 160\) dollars.

2. **Total Revenue**: She sold each bag for $8. Since she sold all 40 bags, her total revenue is \(40 \times 8 = 320\) dollars.

3. **Profit**: Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost. So, her profit is \(320 - 160 = 160\) dollars.

"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem.

First, we know that Suzanne made 36 cookies. According to the problem, Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made. So, we calculate the number of cookies Josh made as follows:

\[ \text{Cookies made by Josh} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Cookies made by Suzanne} \]
\[ \text{Cookies made by Josh} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 \]
\[ \text{Cookies made by Josh} = 9 \]

Next, the problem states that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we calculate the number of cookies Kelsie made as follows:

\[ \text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times \text{Cookies made by Josh} \]
\[ \text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times 9 \]
\[ \text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 18 \]

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies.

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially:

- Four $10 bills: \(4 \times 10 = 40\) dollars
- Six $20 bills: \(6 \times 20 = 120\) dollars

Total money Ali has: \(40 + 120 = 160\) dollars

Next, Ali gives half of this total to his sister:

- Half of $160: \(160 \div 2 = 80\) dollars

So, Ali is left with \(160 - 80 = 80\) dollars.

Then, Ali uses \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining $80 to buy dinner:

- \( \frac{3}{5} \) of $80: \( \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48 \) dollars

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:

"To find the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device, we need to calculate the total cost of electricity for both scenarios and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate the weekly cost before adding the new device:**
   - Daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
   - Cost per kilowatt per hour: $1.50
   - Daily cost: \( 12 \text{ kW/h} \times 1.50 \text{ USD/kW/h} = 18 \text{ USD/day} \)
   - Weekly cost: \( 18 \text{ USD/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 126 \text{ USD/week} \)

2. **Calculate the weekly cost after adding the new device:**
   - New daily consumption: \( 12 \text{ kW/h} + 2 \text{ kW/h} = 14 \text{ kW/h} \)
   - Daily cost: \( 14 \text{ kW/h} \times 1.50 \text{ USD/kW/h} = 21 \text{ USD/day} \)
   - Weekly cost: \( 21 \text{ USD/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 147 \text{ USD/week} \)

3. **Calculate the difference in weekly costs:**

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which one person can paint a house and then scale it up to 5 people.

1. One person can paint half a house in 5 days. Therefore, it would take one person 10 days to paint a whole house.
2. If one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, then the rate of one person is 1 house per 10 days.
3. Since there are 24 hours in a day, 10 days is equivalent to 10 * 24 = 240 hours.
4. Therefore, one person can paint a whole house in 240 hours.
5. If 5 people are working together, their combined rate is 5 times the rate of one person. So, 5 people can paint 5 houses in 240 hours.
6. To find out how long it takes for 5 people to paint 1 house, we divide 240 hours by 5, which equals 48 hours.

"To find out how many more CDs Tom would have been able to buy if he had not purchased the headphone set, we first need to determine the cost of the headphone set. We know the total amount Tom spent and the cost of one CD.

Total amount spent: $48
Cost of one CD: $4

Let's calculate the cost of the headphone set:
Cost of the headphone set = Total amount spent - Cost of one CD
Cost of the headphone set = $48 - $4
Cost of the headphone set = $44

Now, to find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought with the amount he spent on the headphone set, we divide the cost of the headphone set by the cost of one CD:
Number of additional CDs = Cost of the headphone set / Cost of one CD
Number of additional CDs = $44 / $4
Number of additional CDs = 11

So, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had not bought the headphone set.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we can start by calculating the total hours if he had worked out 4 hours every week, and then add the extra hours from the weeks he worked out more.

1. If Josh worked out 4 hours every week for 8 weeks, the total would be:
   \( 4 \, \text{hours/week} \times 8 \, \text{weeks} = 32 \, \text{hours} \)

2. However, there are two weeks where he worked out 5 hours each, which is 1 hour extra per week for two weeks:
   \( 1 \, \text{extra hour/week} \times 2 \, \text{weeks} = 2 \, \text{extra hours} \)

3. There is also one week where he worked out 6 hours, which is 2 hours extra for that week:
   \( 2 \, \text{extra hours} \)

Adding these extra hours to the base total:
\( 32 \, \text{hours} + 2 \, \text{extra hours} + 2 \, \text{extra hours} = 36 \, \text{hours} \)

So, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of people on the bus is now:
   \( 48 - 8 = 40 \)
3. Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 times 8 is:
   \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \)
   So, 40 people get on the bus. The number of people on the bus is now:
   \( 40 + 40 = 80 \)
4. On the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of people on the bus is now:
   \( 80 - 21 = 59 \)
5. Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on. ""3 times fewer"" means one-third of the number who got off. So, one-third of 21 is:
   \( \frac{21}{3} = 7 \)
   So, 7 people get on the bus. The number of people on the bus is now:
   \( 59 + 7 = 66 \)

Therefore, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is 66.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \).

2. **Determine Jame's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.

3. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, the cousin's age in 8 years will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \).

4. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If the cousin will be 55 in 8 years, the cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \).

"To find the cost of one monitor, let's break down the information given:

1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
2. The computer costs $1,100.
3. The printer costs $400 less than the computer, so the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 monitors:

Total cost of all items = Cost of computer + Cost of 2 monitors + Cost of printer
$2,400 = $1,100 + Cost of 2 monitors + $700

Now, we can solve for the cost of 2 monitors:

Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - $1,100 - $700
Cost of 2 monitors = $2,400 - $1,800
Cost of 2 monitors = $600

Since this is the cost for 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor is:

Cost of one monitor = Cost of 2 monitors / 2
Cost of one monitor = $600 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $300

So, the cost of one monitor is $300.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly saving target of $1125, given that he saves twice as much daily in the second half as in the first half.

April has 30 days, so the first half of the month consists of 15 days, and the second half also consists of 15 days.

Let's denote the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of the month as \( x \). Therefore, the amount he saves each day in the second half of the month is \( 2x \).

The total savings for the month can be expressed as:
\[ 15x + 15(2x) = 1125 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \]
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of the month. Therefore, the amount he saves each day in the second half of the month is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Thus, Elvis needs to save $50 each day in the second half of April.

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given. Let \( B \) represent the amount of money Brad gets. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \).

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as:

2. She then writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 is 13, so she writes:
   \(13\) letters.

3. Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written. At this point, she has written 52 + 13 = 65 letters. Rewriting all of these means she writes:
   \(65\) letters again.

Adding all these together, the total number of letters Elise has written is:
\(52 + 13 + 65 = 130\).

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the exponential growth pattern of the phone tree. Each person calls 3 new people, and this process repeats for each subsequent round.

1. In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.
2. In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 more families, so \(3 \times 3 = 9\) new families are called.
3. In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 more families, so \(9 \times 3 = 27\) new families are called.
4. In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 more families, so \(27 \times 3 = 81\) new families are called.

Thus, the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls is 81.

"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost and then add that to his final weight. He lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight loss is:

10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Now, we add the total weight loss to his final weight to find his initial weight:

70 pounds (final weight) + 30 pounds (total weight loss) = 100 pounds

So, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds.

"To determine how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of toys needed for Jonathan to have a play set five times larger than James's play set.
2. James has 80 toys, so five times that amount is \( 80 \times 5 = 400 \) toys.
3. Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to reach this total of 400 toys.
4. Let \( x \) be the number of toys Jonathan currently has. Therefore, \( x + 2 = 400 \).
5. Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 400 - 2 = 398 \).

Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

"To calculate the total cost for Daniel, we first need to determine the cost of each item before the discount, then apply the 10% discount to the total.

1. Cost of notebooks: 5 notebooks * $1.50/notebook = $7.50
2. Cost of pens: 2 pens * $0.25/pen = $0.50
3. Cost of calculator: 1 calculator * $12.00/calculator = $12.00
4. Cost of geometry set: 1 geometry set * $10.00/geometry set = $10.00

Now, we add up the costs to get the total before the discount:
Total before discount = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total:
Discount = 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total before discount to get the final amount Daniel has to spend:
Total after discount = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down her sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the amount over $1000.

1. For the first $1000 in sales, she earns a 30% commission:
   $1000 * 30% = $1000 * 0.30 = $300

2. For the sales over $1000, which is $2500 - $1000 = $1500, she earns an additional 10% commission:
   $1500 * 10% = $1500 * 0.10 = $150

3. To find the total commission, we add the two amounts together:
   $300 + $150 = $450

Therefore, Antonella earned $450 in commission.

"To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we first need to calculate his weekly earnings.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day. Therefore, his daily earnings are:
\[ 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours/day} = 10 \text{ dollars/day} \]

Since he works 4 days a week, his weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \text{ dollars/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:

"To find the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag, we can break the problem into two parts: the holes from the buttons with two holes and the holes from the buttons with four holes.

1. First, we calculate the number of holes from the seven buttons that each have two holes:
   \( 7 \text{ buttons} \times 2 \text{ holes per button} = 14 \text{ holes} \)

2. Next, we determine how many buttons have four holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have two holes, the remaining buttons are:
   \( 21 \text{ buttons} - 7 \text{ buttons} = 14 \text{ buttons} \)

3. Now, we calculate the number of holes from the 14 buttons that each have four holes:
   \( 14 \text{ buttons} \times 4 \text{ holes per button} = 56 \text{ holes} \)

4. Finally, we add the holes from both types of buttons to get the total number of holes:
   \( 14 \text{ holes} + 56 \text{ holes} = 70 \text{ holes} \)

The total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70.

"First, let's determine the daily recommended cups of coffee. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, and Juan drinks 10 times what Octavia drinks, we can set up the following relationships:

Let \( R \) be the daily recommended cups of coffee.
Octavia drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups of coffee.
Juan drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups of coffee.

We know the daily recommended amount \( R \) is 4 cups. Therefore, Juan currently drinks \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) cups of coffee.

To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his intake, we subtract the recommended amount from his current intake:
\( 20 - 4 = 16 \) cups.

"To find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we first need to determine each of their weights.

1. Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds.
2. Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, so:
   \( \text{Susan's weight} = 150 - 20 = 130 \) pounds.
3. Bob's weight is twice Susan's weight, so:
   \( \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times 130 = 260 \) pounds.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the three friends:
\( \text{Total weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \) pounds.

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends:
\( \text{Average weight} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \) pounds.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the angle the sun moves relative to the ground, not just relative to the pyramid. The sun moves 5 degrees an hour straight upward from the pyramid, and it does so for 10 hours. This means the sun will have moved 50 degrees (5 degrees/hour * 10 hours) from the tip of the pyramid.

Since the pyramid itself is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground, we need to add this angle to the angle the sun has moved to find the total angle from the ground to the sun.

Total angle from the ground to the sun = angle of the pyramid + angle the sun has moved
Total angle = 32 degrees + 50 degrees
Total angle = 82 degrees

"To determine how much James spends on candles, we first need to calculate the total number of candles he needs.

1. The age of the older son is 12.
2. The younger son is 4 years younger, so his age is 12 - 4 = 8.

Next, we add the ages of both sons to find the total number of candles required:
12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Each pack contains 5 candles, so we need to determine how many packs are required:
20 candles / 5 candles per pack = 4 packs.

Each pack costs $3, so the total cost is:
4 packs * $3 per pack = $12.

James spends $12 on candles.

"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and then add the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
- So, the total reading time in the first week is \( 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we convert the total reading time into pages:
- Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.
- Therefore, the number of pages she reads per minute is \( \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \).

Now, we calculate the total number of pages read in the first week:
- \( 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \).

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

Finally, we add the pages read in both weeks to get the total:
- \( 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \).

We can set up the equation:
\[ 51 = 3(n + 7) \]

Now, solve for \( n \):
\[ 51 = 3n + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3n \]
\[ 30 = 3n \]
\[ n = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then apply that percentage to the desired temperature of 520 degrees.

First, let's find the percentage increase from the set temperature to the actual temperature when the oven is set to 450 degrees.

The actual temperature is 468 degrees, and the set temperature is 450 degrees. The difference is:

468 - 450 = 18 degrees

The percentage increase is calculated as:

(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

This means the oven is running 4% hotter than the set temperature. To find the temperature Maggie should set the oven to for a desired temperature of 520 degrees, we need to account for this 4% increase.

Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set the oven to. The actual temperature will be \( x \) plus 4% of \( x \):

\[ x + 0.04x = 520 \]

\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]

\[ x = 500 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set the oven to 500 degrees to achieve a temperature of 520 degrees.

1. **Determine the number of cups Judy bought:**
   - Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.

2. **Determine the number of dishes Judy bought:**
   - Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups. Since she bought 12 cups, she bought \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) dishes.

3. **Determine the number of cups Judy's friend brought:**
   - Judy's friend brought 40 cups.

4. **Determine the number of dishes Judy's friend brought:**
   - Judy's friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought \( 24 + 20 = 44 \) dishes.

5. **Calculate the total number of utensils brought by Judy:**
   - Judy brought 12 cups and 24 dishes, so the total number of utensils she brought is \( 12 + 24 = 36 \).

6. **Calculate the total number of utensils brought by Judy's friend:**
   - Judy's friend brought 40 cups and 44 dishes, so the total number of utensils she brought is \( 40 + 44 = 84 \).

7. **Calculate the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend:**
   - The total number of utensils brought by both is \( 36 + 84 = 120 \).

The total number of utensils brought by the two is 120.

"To find out how much each pair of contacts will cost Pete if he buys 2 boxes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost for 2 boxes of contacts with the 10% discount.
2. Determine the total number of contacts Pete will get from 2 boxes.
3. Divide the total cost by the total number of contacts to find the cost per contact.

First, let's calculate the total cost for 2 boxes of contacts with the 10% discount:

- The original price for 1 box is $100.00.
- The discount is 10%, so the discount amount per box is 10% of $100.00, which is $10.00.
- The discounted price per box is $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.
- For 2 boxes, the total cost is 2 * $90.00 = $180.00.

Next, let's determine the total number of contacts Pete will get from 2 boxes:

- Each box contains 90 contacts.
- For 2 boxes, the total number of contacts is 2 * 90 = 180 contacts.

Finally, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts to find the cost per contact:

- The cost per contact is $180.00 / 180 contacts = $1.00 per contact.

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts (since each pair consists of 2 contacts) is:

- $1.00 per contact * 2 contacts per pair = $2.00 per pair.

"To determine how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we first need to calculate the total hours each worked and then their earnings.

Jill's hours:
- Saturday: 2 hours
- Sunday: 1 hour
Total hours for Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

John's hours:
- Saturday: 2 * Jill's Saturday hours = 2 * 2 = 4 hours
- Sunday: 3 * Jill's Sunday hours = 3 * 1 = 3 hours
Total hours for John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours

Earnings:
- Jill earns $10 per hour, so her total earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30
- John earns $10 per hour, so his total earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70

The difference in earnings between John and Jill:
$70 - $30 = $40

"To determine how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total number of calories she burns during her exercise.

1. Calculate the calories burned during aerobics:
   - Hannah does aerobics for 2 hours.
   - She burns 500 calories per hour.
   - Total calories burned from aerobics = 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories.

2. Calculate the calories burned during running:
   - Hannah runs for 1 hour.
   - She burns 600 calories per hour.
   - Total calories burned from running = 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories.

3. Calculate the total calories burned:
   - Total calories burned = calories burned from aerobics + calories burned from running
   - Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.

4. Calculate the amount of water needed:
   - Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned.
   - Water needed = (Total calories burned / 200 calories) * 100 ml
   - Water needed = (1600 calories / 200 calories) * 100 ml
   - Water needed = 8 * 100 ml
   - Water needed = 800 ml.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. We can express these relationships as follows:

- Number of red jelly beans, \( R \) = \( B - 0.01B = 0.99B \)
- Number of green jelly beans, \( G \) = \( B + 0.01B = 1.01B \)

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \):

\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms:

\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now that we know \( B = 1500 \), we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

- Number of red jelly beans, \( R \) = \( 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Number of green jelly beans, \( G \) = \( 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

The difference between the number of green and red jelly beans is:

\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"To find the average of the three typing speed measurements, we first need to determine the third measurement after Jared increases his speed by another 5 words per minute (WPM).

1. Initial speed: 47 WPM
2. After the first increase: 52 WPM
3. After the second increase: 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Now, we calculate the average of these three measurements:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{First measurement} + \text{Second measurement} + \text{Third measurement}}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{156}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average} = 52 \]

   - Therefore, the number of additional people from these invitations is \(100 \times 2 = 200\).

2. **Total from Email Invitations:**
   - Initial 100 people + 200 additional friends = 300 people.

3. **Phone Calls:**
   - Alex calls 10 friends.
   - 8 of these friends will bring their spouses.
   - Therefore, the number of additional people from these calls is \(8 \times 1 = 8\) (since each of the 8 friends brings 1 spouse).

4. **Total from Phone Calls:**
   - 10 friends + 8 spouses = 18 people.

5. **Total Number of Seats Needed:**
   - Total from email invitations (300) + Total from phone calls (18) = 318.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the total protein intake per day.
3. Multiply the daily protein intake by the number of days in a week to get the weekly protein intake.

Step 1: Since 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein, 200 grams of mushrooms will contain twice as much protein:
\[ 3 \, \text{grams of protein} \times 2 = 6 \, \text{grams of protein} \]

Step 2: John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, so he gets 6 grams of protein per day.

Step 3: To find the weekly protein intake, multiply the daily intake by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ 6 \, \text{grams of protein/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 42 \, \text{grams of protein/week} \]

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( J \) represent Jerry's current age. According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, 5 years ago, Jerry was \( J - 5 \) years old. The problem states that his current age is twice that age:

\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve for \( J \):

\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. The question asks how old Jerry will be in 3 years. Therefore, we add 3 to his current age:

\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, the second angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and the third angle is three times the smallest angle, making it \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

The largest angle is \( 3x \), so we calculate:
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

The measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents, since each gumball costs 5 cents (a nickel).

- Quarters: 8 quarters * 25 cents/quarter = 200 cents
- Dimes: 6 dimes * 10 cents/dime = 60 cents
- Nickels: 14 nickels * 5 cents/nickel = 70 cents
- Pennies: 15 pennies * 1 cent/penny = 15 cents

Now, we add up all the cents:

200 cents (from quarters) + 60 cents (from dimes) + 70 cents (from nickels) + 15 cents (from pennies) = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The speed of the plane is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken. 

The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so the speed of the plane is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 additional hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate.

2. **Marissa's Rate:**
   - Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in 2 hours.
   - Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, so Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \).

3. **Total Production in 12 Hours:**
   - If they both work for 12 hours, we calculate the total amount of chocolates each makes and then sum them up.
   - Ruiz's total production in 12 hours: \( 60 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \).
   - Marissa's total production in 12 hours: \( 90 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \).

4. **Combined Total:**

"To find out how much Scarlett spent in total, we need to add up the cost of all the items she purchased.

1. The aquarium cost $10.00.
2. The 2 bags of rocks cost $2.50 each, so 2 * $2.50 = $5.00.
3. The 3 pieces of coral cost $2.00 each, so 3 * $2.00 = $6.00.
4. The 20 fish cost $0.50 each, so 20 * $0.50 = $10.00.
5. The fish food cost $2.00.

Now, we add all these amounts together:

$10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00

So, Scarlett spent a total of $33.00.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb per second to kb per hour.
2. Convert the speed from kb per hour to Mb per hour.

First, we know that there are 3600 seconds in one hour. So, we multiply the speed in kb per second by 3600 to get the speed in kb per hour:

20 kb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72000 kb/hour

Next, we convert kb to Mb. Since 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb, we divide the speed in kb per hour by 1000:

72000 kb/hour / 1000 kb/Mb = 72 Mb/hour

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour.

"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the tow truck in that week, we can break down the week into two parts: the first three days and the remaining four days.

For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. So, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
3 days * 10 cars/day = 30 cars

For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled four fewer cars than 10 each day, which means it pulled 6 cars each day. So, the total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:
4 days * 6 cars/day = 24 cars

Now, we add the totals from both parts of the week to get the total number of cars towed for the entire week:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we first need to convert the required height from feet to inches, since Adam's height is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the required height is:

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Adam is currently 40 inches tall and grows 2 inches each year. We need to find out how many years it will take for him to grow from 40 inches to 48 inches.

The difference in height that Adam needs to grow is:

48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, the number of years it will take for him to grow 8 inches is:

8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years

So, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total sales amount.
2. Determine the cost to the company for acquiring the cars.
3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the acquisition cost from the total sales.
4. Calculate James's commission based on the profit.

Step 1: Total sales amount
James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
Total sales = 10 * $25,000 = $250,000

Step 2: Cost to the company for acquiring the cars
The company paid 30% of the car's price to acquire each car.
Acquisition cost per car = 30% of $25,000 = 0.30 * $25,000 = $7,500
Total acquisition cost for 10 cars = 10 * $7,500 = $75,000

Step 3: Calculate the profit
Profit = Total sales - Total acquisition cost
Profit = $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000

Step 4: Calculate James's commission
James's commission is 10% of the profit.
Commission = 10% of $175,000 = 0.10 * $175,000 = $17,500

James made $17,500.

"To find the total price for all three jewels, we need to calculate the price of each jewel and then sum them up.

1. **Price of a Diamond Jewel**: Given as $2000.

2. **Price of a Gold Jewel**: The price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Price of Gold Jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600
   \]

3. **Price of a Silver Jewel**: The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Price of Silver Jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]

4. **Total Price for All Three Jewels**: We sum the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:
   \[
   \text{Total Price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between them. The key is to find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob.

Tom's speed: 70 mph
Bob's speed: 55 mph

The relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob is the difference in their speeds:
70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. To find out how long it will take to close a 75-mile gap, we use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Plugging in the values:
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to calculate the cost per class and see how many absences would push the cost per attended class over $10.

1. The total cost for the classes is $60.
2. There are 10 total classes.
3. The cost per class if he attends all of them is $60 / 10 = $6 per class.

If Manny misses some classes, the cost per attended class will increase. We need to find the maximum number of classes he can miss such that the cost per attended class does not exceed $10.

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny misses. Then, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

The cost per attended class is then \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \).

We set up the inequality to find the maximum \( x \) such that the cost per attended class is still $10 or less:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per attended class exceeds $10.

1. Jewel processes 50 customers daily.
2. Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel, so Julie processes 50 * 2 = 100 customers daily.
3. Together, they process 50 (Jewel) + 100 (Julie) = 150 customers daily.
4. Since they work all days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 customers/day * 7 days/week = 1050 customers/week.

2. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, which is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) miles.
3. Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. If we let \(L\) represent the number of miles Lynn ran, then Reggie's distance can be expressed as \(L + 3\).

Since we know Reggie ran 20 miles, we can set up the equation:
\[ L + 3 = 20 \]

Solving for \(L\):
\[ L = 20 - 3 \]
\[ L = 17 \]

So, Lynn ran 17 miles.

"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole he plans to dig. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular hole can be calculated using the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it will take Bob to shovel 72 cubic feet of earth. We know that it takes him 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) in seconds can be calculated as:

\[ T = 72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

So, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - We know that the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month are \( 2 \times 400 = 800 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first month:**
   - Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total sales in the first month = \( 400 + 800 = 1200 \) dollars.

3. **Determine the sales for the second month:**
   - In the second month, her sales were \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total sales of the first month.
   - Sales in the second month = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total sales for two months:**
   - Total sales for two months = Sales in the first month + Sales in the second month
   - Total sales for two months = \( 1200 + 900 = 2100 \) dollars.

The total amount she made in two months is:

"To determine how much James paid for the horse-drawn carriage, let's break down the costs:

1. James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.
2. He gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.
3. The first paid hour costs $15.
4. Each subsequent hour costs twice the previous hour's cost.

Let's calculate the cost for each paid hour:
- First hour: $15
- Second hour: $15 * 2 = $30
- Third hour: $30 * 2 = $60

Now, let's sum up the costs:
- Total cost = $15 + $30 + $60 = $105

Therefore, James paid $105.

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:
   Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and there are 16 guests.
   \( 3 \times 16 = 48 \) deviled egg halves.

2. Determine the number of whole eggs required:
   Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many whole eggs are required to make 48 deviled egg halves.
   \( \frac{48}{2} = 24 \) whole eggs.

3. Convert the number of whole eggs to dozens:
   There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
   \( \frac{24}{12} = 2 \) dozens of eggs.

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs.

"To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate the total number of days it will take him to read the 200-page book at a rate of 10 pages per day.

First, we calculate the total number of days required to read the book:
\[ \text{Total pages} \div \text{Pages per day} = 200 \div 10 = 20 \text{ days} \]

Next, we subtract the number of days it will take Mike to read the book from the total number of days he has to complete the assignment:
\[ 30 \text{ days} - 20 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.

"To calculate the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly hanger rental, and the monthly fuel expenses.

1. Initial cost of the plane: $150,000
2. Monthly hanger rental: $5,000
3. Monthly fuel cost: $5,000 * 2 = $10,000

Now, we calculate the total monthly maintenance cost:
- Monthly maintenance cost (hanger + fuel) = $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000

Next, we calculate the total maintenance cost for the year:
- Annual maintenance cost = $15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the annual maintenance cost to get the total cost for the first year:
- Total cost for the first year = $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000

$330,000"
"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.
2. It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so the cooking time for pork is 30 minutes (for rice) + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.
3. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 minutes (for rice) + 50 minutes (for pork) = 80 minutes. Therefore, the cooking time for beans is 80 minutes / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, to find the total cooking time for all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans:

30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) + 40 minutes (beans) = 120 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, and geese have 2 legs and 1 head. We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of animal heads is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

From this, we can write the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (total number of legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To solve for \( S \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15.

"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( R \). According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so we can write:

\[ T = R + 7 \]

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. Since there are two twins and three triplets, we can write the equation for their combined ages as:

\[ 2T + 3R = 44 \]

Now, we can substitute \( T \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ 2(R + 7) + 3R = 44 \]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[ 2R + 14 + 3R = 44 \]
\[ 5R + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5R = 30 \]
\[ R = 6 \]

Now that we know \( R \), we can find \( T \):

10 lollipops * $0.40 per lollipop = $4.00
10 candies * $0.30 per candy = $3.00

Adding these together gives us the total cost:
$4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00

Therefore, the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $7.00.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many coins Neil saves each month and then calculate the total savings for both Rong and Neil over ten years.

1. **Rong's Monthly Savings:**
   Rong saves 20 coins every month.

2. **Neil's Monthly Savings:**
   Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. This means Neil saves:
   \[
   20 + \left(\frac{2}{5} \times 20\right) = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month}
   \]

3. **Total Savings Over Ten Years:**
   - There are 12 months in a year, so over ten years, there are:
     \[
     10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months}
     \]
   - Rong's total savings over ten years:
     \[
     20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins}
     \]
   - Neil's total savings over ten years:
     \[
     28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins}
     \]

4. **Combined Total Savings:**
   \[
   2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins}
   \]

The total number of coins they have after ten years is 5760.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the vaccines:**
   - Each vaccine costs $20.
   - John's dog needs 2 vaccines.
   - Total cost for vaccines = 2 * $20 = $40.

2. **Determine the total bill:**
   - Let the total bill be \( T \).
   - The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill.
   - Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check = 0.60 * \( T \).

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check.
   - \( T = 40 + 0.60T \).

4. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - \( T - 0.60T = 40 \)
   - \( 0.40T = 40 \)
   - \( T = \frac{40}{0.40} \)
   - \( T = 100 \).

5. **Calculate how much John leaves with:**
   - John brought $125 with him.
   - He spends $100 on the vet bill.
   - Amount left = $125 - $100 = $25.

So, John leaves with $25.

"To calculate the total price of the crate of fruit, we need to determine the cost of each type of fruit and then sum these costs.

1. The cost of one apple is $0.5.
2. The cost of one banana is twice the cost of an apple, so one banana costs \(0.5 \times 2 = $1.0\).
3. The cost of one orange is three times the cost of a banana, so one orange costs \(1.0 \times 3 = $3.0\).

Now, we calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:

- The total cost for bananas: \(5 \times 1.0 = $5.0\)
- The total cost for apples: \(12 \times 0.5 = $6.0\)
- The total cost for oranges: \(7 \times 3.0 = $21.0\)

Finally, we sum these amounts to get the total cost of the crate:

\[5.0 + 6.0 + 21.0 = $32.0\]

"To find the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter in square feet, we need to determine the number of squares of each color and then sum them up. Each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, so the number of squares is equal to the area in square feet.

1. **Red Squares**: The problem states there are 14 red squares.
2. **Blue Squares**: There are 4 more blue squares than red squares. Therefore, the number of blue squares is:
   \[
   14 + 4 = 18
   \]
3. **Green Squares**: There are 6 more green squares than blue squares. Therefore, the number of green squares is:
   \[
   18 + 6 = 24
   \]
4. **White Squares**: There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. Therefore, the number of white squares is:
   \[
   24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Now, we sum the number of squares of each color to find the total number of squares:
\[
14 \text{ (red)} + 18 \text{ (blue)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 12 \text{ (white)} = 68
\]

Since each square is 1 square foot, the total area of the comforter is:
\[
68 \text{ square feet}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
68"
"To determine how many more chairs Mia needs to get for the function, we first need to calculate the total number of chairs required and then compare it to the number of chairs the restaurant currently has.

1. **Calculate the total number of chairs needed:**
   - There are 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of chairs needed is:
     \[
     42 \text{ (adults)} + 15 \text{ (babies)} = 57 \text{ chairs}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of regular chairs and high chairs the restaurant has:**
   - The restaurant has 8 high chairs.
   - The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, so:
     \[
     5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ regular chairs}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of chairs the restaurant currently has:**
   - The total number of chairs is the sum of the regular chairs and high chairs:
     \[
     40 \text{ (regular chairs)} + 8 \text{ (high chairs)} = 48 \text{ chairs}
     \]

4. **Determine how many more chairs are needed:**
   - The number of additional chairs needed is the difference between the total number of chairs required and the total number of chairs the restaurant has:
     \[
     57 \text{ (chairs needed)} - 48 \text{ (chairs available)} = 9 \text{ chairs}
     \]

Mia needs to get 9 more chairs.

"To find out how many points the class is missing to go on the trip, we need to calculate the total points collected by all the students and then subtract this total from the minimum threshold of 400 points.

1. Adam has collected 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. To find out how many points Betty has, we calculate 30% of Adam's points and add it to Adam's points:
   - 30% of 50 points = 0.30 * 50 = 15 points
   - Betty's points = 50 + 15 = 65 points
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty:
   - Tom's points = 65 - 30 = 35 points
4. Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom:
   - Martha's points = 3 * 35 = 105 points

Now, we add up all the points collected by the students:
- Total points = Adam's points + Betty's points + Tom's points + Martha's points
- Total points = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points from the threshold:
- Points missing = 400 - 255 = 145 points

"To determine how many fireworks Hannah will see in total, we need to calculate the number of fireworks set off by the city that she can see and the number of fireworks she will set off herself.

First, calculate the total number of fireworks set off by the city:
15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = 300 fireworks

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks:
300 fireworks * 40% = 300 * 0.4 = 120 fireworks

Next, calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard:
3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = 15 fireworks

Now, add the fireworks Hannah will see from the city to the fireworks she will set off herself:
120 fireworks + 15 fireworks = 135 fireworks

Hannah will see a total of 135 fireworks.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:

13 + 7 = 20 people

Each person saves a seat, and each seat can hold two drinks and three snacks. Therefore, for 20 seats, the total number of drinks and snacks that can be held is:

Drinks: 20 seats * 2 drinks/seat = 40 drinks
Snacks: 20 seats * 3 snacks/seat = 60 snacks

The total number of drinks and snacks is the sum of the drinks and snacks:

40 drinks + 60 snacks = 100 items

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total cost for all the drinks and snacks is:

100 items * $2/item = $200

Therefore, the group has spent $200 on snacks and drinks.

"To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we can start by calculating the capacity of Gordy's truck and then use the total capacity of all three trucks to find Gary's truck capacity.

1. Gissela's truck capacity: 4,000 pounds
2. Gordy's truck capacity: 4,000 pounds + 800 pounds = 4,800 pounds
3. Combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks: 4,000 pounds + 4,800 pounds = 8,800 pounds
4. Total capacity of all three trucks: 11,600 pounds

Now, to find Gary's truck capacity, we subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity:

11,600 pounds - 8,800 pounds = 2,800 pounds

Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

"To find out how many dumplings Larry cooked, we need to calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by both the males and the females.

Given that each female ate 3 dumplings, and there are 6 females, the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:
6 females * 3 dumplings/female = 18 dumplings

Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate:
3 dumplings/female + 1 dumpling = 4 dumplings

There are 8 males, including Larry, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:
8 males * 4 dumplings/male = 32 dumplings

The total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings eaten by the males and the females:
18 dumplings (females) + 32 dumplings (males) = 50 dumplings

Therefore, Larry cooked 50 dumplings.

"To find out how many feet Martha's turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we first need to determine the turtle's speed. We know that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and that the cat can run at a speed of 15 feet per second.

Let's denote the turtle's speed as \( T \) (feet/second). Since the cat is 5 times faster, we can write the relationship as:
\[ 15 = 5T \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now that we know the turtle's speed is 3 feet per second, we can calculate how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of hours required to reach the fundraising goal of $6300, given that the firefighters raised $2100 in the first 3 hours and assuming an equal amount is raised every hour.

First, we calculate the hourly rate of fundraising:
\[ \text{Hourly rate} = \frac{\text{Total amount raised in 3 hours}}{\text{Number of hours}} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how much more money is needed to reach the goal:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = \text{Total goal} - \text{Amount already raised} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the number of additional hours required to raise the remaining amount:
\[ \text{Additional hours} = \frac{\text{Remaining amount}}{\text{Hourly rate}} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we add the initial 3 hours to the additional hours to find the total number of hours required:
\[ \text{Total hours} = 3 + 6 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

"To find the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract this percentage from the total percentage of water used by the city to find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes.

First, we know that 40% of the river's water is used by the city. Out of this, 80% is used for industrial purposes. To find the percentage of the river's water used for industrial purposes, we calculate:

40% * 80% = 0.40 * 0.80 = 0.32 or 32%

This means 32% of the river's water is used for industrial purposes by the city. To find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial percentage from the total percentage used by the city:

40% - 32% = 8%

So, 8% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

"To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to compare the cost of the damage to his car if the pothole is not fixed with the total cost of fixing the pothole himself.

1. **Cost of damage to car if pothole is not fixed:** $450
2. **Cost of fixing the pothole:**
   - Fine for unauthorized road maintenance: $120
   - Cost of 3 buckets of asphalt: 3 * $25 = $75
   - Total cost of fixing the pothole: $120 + $75 = $195

3. **Money saved by fixing the pothole:**
   - Cost of damage to car - Cost of fixing the pothole = $450 - $195 = $255

Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself.

"To find out how many chairs the restaurant has left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

First, let's calculate the number of normal chairs left:
170 normal chairs - 20 normal chairs sent for repair = 150 normal chairs left.

Next, let's calculate the number of baby chairs left:
23 baby chairs - 13 baby chairs sent for repair = 10 baby chairs left.

Now, we add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs together to get the total number of chairs left:
150 normal chairs + 10 baby chairs = 160 chairs left.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of slices each person ate and then subtract that from the total number of slices available.

1. **Total slices per pizza**: 12 slices
2. **Number of pizzas**: 5 (one for Bryce and one for each of his four friends)

First, calculate the total number of slices available:
\[ 5 \text{ pizzas} \times 12 \text{ slices per pizza} = 60 \text{ slices} \]

Next, calculate the number of slices eaten by Bryce and the two friends who ate 2/3 of their pizzas:
\[ \text{Slices eaten by each of these 3 people} = \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ slices per person} \]
\[ \text{Total slices eaten by Bryce and 2 friends} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Now, calculate the number of slices eaten by the two remaining friends who ate 3/4 of their pizzas:
\[ \text{Slices eaten by each of these 2 people} = \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \text{ slices per person} \]
\[ \text{Total slices eaten by the 2 remaining friends} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Add the slices eaten by all the friends:
\[ \text{Total slices eaten} = 24 + 18 = 42 \text{ slices} \]

Finally, subtract the total slices eaten from the total slices available to find the number of slices left:
\[ \text{Slices left} = 60 - 42 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the time it takes for the dog to eat nine sausages.

The cat takes 30 minutes to eat nine sausages. The dog takes 2/3 of this time, so we calculate the dog's time as follows:

\[ \text{Dog's time} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we find the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is calculated by adding the times together and dividing by 2:

\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Cat's time} + \text{Dog's time}}{2} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to convert the length of Topher's shoe into inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 8 feet and 4 inches can be converted as follows:

8 feet * 12 inches/foot + 4 inches = 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

So, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches.

According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. We can set up the following equation to represent this relationship, where \( B \) is the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches:

\[ 100 = 9B + 10 \]

To find \( B \), we need to solve for \( B \):

\[ 100 - 10 = 9B \]
\[ 90 = 9B \]
\[ B = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ B = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars.

First, let's calculate the number of windows in the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each car has 4 windows.
- Total windows in students' cars = 64 cars * 4 windows/car = 256 windows.

Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows:
- Windows smashed in students' cars = 1/4 * 256 windows = 64 windows.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each car has 2 windows.
- Total windows in teachers' cars = 32 cars * 2 windows/car = 64 windows.

Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows:
- Windows smashed in teachers' cars = 3/4 * 64 windows = 48 windows.

Now, we add the number of windows smashed in both the students' and teachers' cars:
- Total windows smashed = 64 windows (students) + 48 windows (teachers) = 112 windows.

The total number of spools is the sum of all the spools:
15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150 spools

Now, to find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = 0.4 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = 40\% \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Dora's father's age:**
   - Dora's age is 15 years.
   - Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age.
   - Twice Dora's age is \(2 \times 15 = 30\).
   - Eight more than twice Dora's age is \(30 + 8 = 38\).
   - Therefore, Dora's father is 38 years old.

2. **Determine Dora's mother's age:**
   - Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father.
   - Dora's father is 38 years old.
   - Four years younger than 38 is \(38 - 4 = 34\).
   - Therefore, Dora's mother is 34 years old.

3. **Calculate the total combined age:**
   - Dora's age is 15 years.
   - Dora's father's age is 38 years.
   - Dora's mother's age is 34 years.

"To find the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying, we need to add the weights of all her books together.

First, we need to determine the weight of each type of book:
- Math and science books weigh 2 pounds each. If we assume she has one of each, that's 2 pounds for the math book and 2 pounds for the science book, totaling 4 pounds.
- The French book weighs 4 pounds.
- The English book weighs 3 pounds.
- The history book weighs twice as much as the English book, so it weighs 2 * 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of all the books:
4 (math and science) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (history) = 17 pounds

Therefore, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds.

"To find out how many votes candidate C received, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of votes candidate A received.
2. Determine the number of votes candidate B received, which is 50% more than candidate A's votes.
3. Subtract the total votes of candidates A and B from the total number of votes to find the number of votes for candidate C.

Step 1: Candidate A's votes
- Candidate A received 20% of the votes.
- 20% of 100 voters = 0.20 * 100 = 20 votes.

Step 2: Candidate B's votes
- Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A.
- 50% of candidate A's votes = 0.50 * 20 = 10 votes.
- Therefore, candidate B received 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

Step 3: Candidate C's votes
- Total votes = 100.
- Votes for candidates A and B = 20 (A) + 30 (B) = 50 votes.
- Votes for candidate C = 100 - 50 = 50 votes.

Candidate C received 50 votes.

"To find out how many shirts Krissa needs to order, let's break down the information given:

1. 11 students need size extra-small.
2. Twice as many students need size small as extra-small, so:
   \( 2 \times 11 = 22 \) students need size small.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so:
   \( 22 - 4 = 18 \) students need size medium.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so:
   \( 18 / 2 = 9 \) students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so:
   \( 9 + 6 = 15 \) students need size extra-large.

Now, we add up all the shirts needed for each size:

\( 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75 \)

Therefore, Krissa needs to order 75 shirts in total.

"To find out how many puppies Jana has, we can start by determining the total number of Pomeranians. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls and there are 6 Pomeranian girls, we can set up the following equation:

1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's use this information to find the total number of puppies:

2/3 * Total Puppies = Total Pomeranians
2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we multiply both sides of the equation by 3/2:

Total Puppies = 18 * (3/2)
Total Puppies = 27

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies in total.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \). According to the problem:

- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs half of the second).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since it needs double the first).

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases, so:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

"To determine the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores, we need to calculate the points for each of the three categories (enemies, berries, and time) and then find the total difference.

1. **Enemies Jumped On:**
   - Let \( E \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
   - Ava jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies.
   - Points for enemies: Emma gets \( 10E \) points, and Ava gets \( 10(E + 8) = 10E + 80 \) points.

2. **Berries Collected:**
   - Let \( B \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
   - Ava collects \( B + 3 \) berries.
   - Points for berries: Emma gets \( 5B \) points, and Ava gets \( 5(B + 3) = 5B + 15 \) points.

3. **Time Left on the Timer:**
   - Let \( T \) be the number of seconds Emma has left on the timer.
   - Ava finishes 4 seconds slower, so she has \( T - 4 \) seconds left.
   - Points for time: Emma gets \( 30T \) points, and Ava gets \( 30(T - 4) = 30T - 120 \) points.

Now, we calculate the total scores for both Ava and Emma:

- **Emma's Total Score:**
  \[
  10E + 5B + 30T
  \]

- **Ava's Total Score:**
  \[
  10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T - 4) = 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120 = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25
  \]

The difference between Ava's and Emma's scores is:
\[
(10E + 5B + 30T - 25) - (10E + 5B + 30T) = -25

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Fish Count:**
   - Bob initially had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.

2. **Fish Bought from the Store:**
   - Bob bought 17 more fish from the store, which included both orange and white fish. Let's denote the number of orange fish he bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish he bought as \( W \).

3. **Total Fish After Purchase:**
   - After buying the fish, the total number of orange fish Bob has is \( 3 + O \).
   - The total number of white fish Bob has is \( 4 + W \).

4. **Condition Given:**
   - Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     3 + O = 2 \times (4 + W)
     \]

5. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     3 + O = 8 + 2W
     \]
   - Rearrange to isolate \( O \):
     \[
     O = 8 + 2W - 3
     \]
     \[
     O = 5 + 2W
     \]

6. **Total Fish Bought:**
   - We know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17:
     \[
     O + W = 17
     \]

7. **Substitute \( O \) in the Total Fish Equation:**
   - Substitute \( O = 5 + 2W \) into \( O + W = 17 \):
     \[
     5 + 2W + W = 17
     \]
     \[
     5 + 3W = 17
     \]
   - Solve for \( W \):
     \[
     3W = 12
     \]
     \[
     W = 4
     \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

"To determine how much money Andy's car is consuming per week for his commute, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Andy drives to work each week.
2. Determine the total amount of fuel used each week.
3. Calculate the total cost of the fuel used each week.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance driven each week.**

Andy drives to work and back home each day, which is a round trip of:
\[ 5 \text{ miles (one way)} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles per day} \]

Since he drives to work from Monday to Friday, the total distance driven each week is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ miles/week} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of fuel used each week.**

Andy's car has a fuel efficiency of 10 miles per gallon (MPG). Therefore, the total amount of fuel used each week is:
\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles/week}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons/week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the fuel used each week.**

The price of regular gas is $3 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost of the fuel used each week is:
\[ 5 \text{ gallons/week} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the total amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week for his commute is:

"To determine how many logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing, we first need to calculate the temperature during the night.

The temperature during the day is 45 degrees. It is 33 degrees colder during the night, so the temperature at night is:

45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, so Carson needs to raise the temperature from 12 degrees to at least 32 degrees. The difference in temperature that needs to be made up is:

32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees

Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we divide the total temperature increase needed by the temperature increase provided by one log:

20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs

Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of groups formed. Since 90 people are split into 9-person groups, we divide 90 by 9:

90 / 9 = 10 groups

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups had members bring back seashells. According to the problem, 3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells:

3/5 * 10 = 6 groups

Each member of these 6 groups brought back 2 seashells. Since each group has 9 members, the total number of seashells brought back by one group is:

9 members * 2 seashells/member = 18 seashells

Now, we multiply the number of seashells brought back by one group by the number of groups that brought back seashells:

18 seashells/group * 6 groups = 108 seashells

Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is 108.

"To solve this problem, we start with the initial number of people on the train and then adjust for the number of people getting off and on at each stop.

1. Initial number of people on the train: 172
2. At the first stop, 47 people get off and 13 people get on:
   - People after the first stop: 172 - 47 + 13 = 138
3. At the next stop, 38 people get off:
   - People after the second stop: 138 - 38 = 100

So, the number of people on the train after the second stop is 100.

"To find out how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily value of the bottle caps he finds.
2. Multiply the daily value by the number of days in the month.

Step 1: Daily value of bottle caps
- Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day.
- Each bottle cap is worth $0.25.
- Daily value = 10 bottle caps/day * $0.25/bottle cap = $2.50/day

Step 2: Monthly value
- There are 30 days in the month.
- Monthly value = $2.50/day * 30 days = $75.00

So, Damien makes $75.00 in a 30-day month.

"To calculate Jamie's pay for the day she worked 11 hours, we need to consider both her regular and overtime pay.

1. **Regular Pay**: Jamie earns $20 per hour for the first 8 hours.
   - Regular pay = 8 hours * $20/hour = $160

2. **Overtime Pay**: For the additional 3 hours, she is paid at 150% of her regular hourly rate.
   - Overtime hourly rate = 150% of $20 = 1.5 * $20 = $30/hour
   - Overtime pay = 3 hours * $30/hour = $90

3. **Total Pay for the Day**: The sum of her regular pay and overtime pay.
   - Total pay = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $160 + $90 = $250

Therefore, Jamie was paid $250 for her work that day.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of employees after three months.
2. Calculate the total monthly salary for all employees.
3. Multiply the total monthly salary by the number of months (3) to get the total amount paid over three months.

Step 1: Determine the total number of employees after three months.
- Initial number of employees: 200
- Number of new employees hired each month: 20
- Number of months: 3

Total number of new employees hired in three months = 20 employees/month * 3 months = 60 employees

Total number of employees after three months = Initial employees + New employees
= 200 + 60 = 260 employees

Step 2: Calculate the total monthly salary for all employees.
- Monthly salary per employee: $4000

Total monthly salary for all employees = Number of employees * Monthly salary per employee
= 260 employees * $4000/employee = $1,040,000

Step 3: Calculate the total amount paid over three months.
Total amount paid over three months = Total monthly salary * Number of months
= $1,040,000 * 3 = $3,120,000

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is $3,120,000.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the hourly rates for both Billy and Sally, and then determine how much each of them earns for working 20 hours. Finally, we will find the difference in their earnings.

1. **Billy's hourly rate:**
   - Starting rate: $10.00 per hour
   - After 2 months, raise: $0.50 per hour
   - On his first anniversary, raise: $1.00 per hour

   Billy's current hourly rate = $10.00 + $0.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour

2. **Sally's hourly rate:**
   - Sally's starting rate is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting rate.
   - Billy's starting rate: $10.00 per hour
   - Sally's starting rate: $10.00 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour

3. **Earnings for 20 hours:**
   - Billy's earnings: $11.50 per hour * 20 hours = $230.00
   - Sally's earnings: $10.50 per hour * 20 hours = $210.00

4. **Difference in earnings:**
   - Difference = Billy's earnings - Sally's earnings

"To find out how many trees will be planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students:
- There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class.
- So, the total number of students is 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students.
- Each student plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by students is 1000 trees.

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- There are 40 classes with 3 teachers per class.
- So, the total number of teachers is 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers.
- Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees.

Finally, we add the number of trees planted by students and teachers to get the total number of trees planted:
- Total trees = Trees planted by students + Trees planted by teachers
- Total trees = 1000 trees + 240 trees = 1240 trees

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy to make them 30% of her total collection, we first need to calculate the current total number of stuffed animals she has.

Bubbles has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

The total number of stuffed animals she currently has is:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to be 30% of the total collection. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

To solve for \( x \), we first distribute the 0.30:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To determine how many hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we first calculate the total hours she has already played.

1. Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks:
   - There are 14 days in 2 weeks.
   - Half an hour is 0.5 hours.
   - Total hours for 2 weeks: \(14 \times 0.5 = 7\) hours.

2. Kris then plays for 2 hours every day for a week:
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Total hours for 1 week: \(7 \times 2 = 14\) hours.

3. Adding the hours from both periods:
   - Total hours played: \(7 + 14 = 21\) hours.

4. Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement:
   - Hours still needed: \(30 - 21 = 9\) hours.

"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it will travel:
60 miles/hour * 2 hours = 120 miles

The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it will travel:
70 miles/hour * 2 hours = 140 miles

The difference in distance traveled by the two cars after 2 hours will be:
140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

Therefore, after 2 hours, the two cars will be 20 miles apart.

"To find out how much James paid for the ring, we need to calculate the total cost of the materials and then add the 30% premium.

1. First, we add the cost of the diamond and the gold:
   - Diamond: $600
   - Gold: $300
   - Total cost of materials: $600 + $300 = $900

2. Next, we calculate the 30% premium on the total cost of materials:
   - 30% of $900 = 0.30 * $900 = $270

3. Finally, we add the premium to the total cost of materials to find the final amount James paid:
   - Total cost of materials: $900
   - Premium: $270
   - Final amount paid: $900 + $270 = $1170

"To find the school's overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students who took the test, then divide the number of students who passed by the total number of students.

First, let's find the pass rate for each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed, so the pass rate is 340/500.
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed, so the pass rate is 40/100.
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth-graders, so it's 2 * (40/100) = 80/100. Since there are 400 fifth-graders, the number who passed is 400 * (80/100) = 320.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total passed = 340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 320 (fifth-graders) = 700.
- Total students = 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000.

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students:

Overall pass rate = 700 / 1000 = 0.7 or 70%.

"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of mosaic can be made with the total number of glass chips.
3. Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, calculate the length of the mosaic based on the area that can be covered.

First, let's calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has:
- Each bag holds 72 chips.
- Milo has 2 bags.
- Total chips = 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips.

Next, we need to determine how many square inches of mosaic can be made with 144 chips:
- It takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch.
- Total square inches = 144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches.

Now, we know the mosaic is 3 inches tall, so we need to find out how long it can be:
- Area of the mosaic = height * length.
- 12 square inches = 3 inches * length.
- Length = 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches.

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

"To find out how many gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party, we first need to calculate the total amount of tea that was consumed and then add the 10 quarts that were left over. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the four students who each drank 1.5 quarts:
4 students * 1.5 quarts/student = 6 quarts

Next, we calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the 16 students who each drank 2 quarts:
16 students * 2 quarts/student = 32 quarts

Now, we add the tea consumed by all the students together:
6 quarts + 32 quarts = 38 quarts

Then, we add the 10 quarts that were left over to find the total amount of tea that was at the beginning of the party:
38 quarts + 10 quarts = 48 quarts

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
48 quarts / 4 quarts/gallon = 12 gallons

Therefore, there were 12 gallons of tea at the beginning of the party.

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed on average per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches climbed in the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in the week to find the average.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 per branch and he made $105 in a week. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total earnings by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches} = 420 \]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day.

"To find the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase, we need to calculate the number of petals for each type of flower Rose picked, subtract the petals from the flowers she dropped, and then sum the remaining petals.

1. For the first set of flowers: 3 flowers with 5 petals each.
   \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.

2. For the second set of flowers: 4 flowers with 6 petals each.
   \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.

3. For the third set of flowers: 5 flowers with 4 petals each.
   \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.

4. For the fourth set of flowers: 6 flowers with 7 petals each.
   \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

Now, we add the petals from all the flowers before any are dropped:
\(15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\) petals.

Since Rose drops 1 of each type of flower, we need to subtract the petals of one flower from each type:
- 1 flower with 5 petals: \(5\) petals.
- 1 flower with 6 petals: \(6\) petals.
- 1 flower with 4 petals: \(4\) petals.
- 1 flower with 7 petals: \(7\) petals.

Total petals from the dropped flowers:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total marshmallows in the bag**: 35
2. **Marshmallows used by John**: 9
3. **Marshmallows used by DeSean**: 9

First, calculate the total number of marshmallows used and dropped:

\[ 9 \text{ (John's S'mores)} + 9 \text{ (DeSean's S'mores)} + 3 \text{ (dropped)} = 21 \]

Next, subtract the total number of marshmallows used and dropped from the initial number of marshmallows:

\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \]

So, there are 14 marshmallows left in the bag. Since John and DeSean are sharing these marshmallows equally, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2:

\[ 14 \div 2 = 7 \]

Each kid can have 7 more S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

"To determine how much money is used, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then convert that time into the number of quarters used.

1. **Jack's Play Time:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
   - They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.
   - Number of quarters Jack uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \).

2. **Two Friends (Worse Players):**
   - Each of these friends can play for 10 minutes per quarter (half of Jack's time).
   - Number of quarters each worse friend uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters} \).
   - Since there are two worse friends, total quarters used by both: \( 24 \text{ quarters} \times 2 = 48 \text{ quarters} \).

3. **One Friend (Better Player):**
   - This friend can play for 30 minutes per quarter (1.5 times Jack's time).
   - Number of quarters the better friend uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \).

4. **Total Quarters Used:**
   - Jack: 12 quarters
   - Two worse friends: 48 quarters
   - One better friend: 8 quarters
   - Total quarters used: \( 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters} \).

5. **Total Money Used:**

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables for the amounts of each ingredient Tanya uses:

- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since the amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces.
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so \( s = 2z \).

The total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:

\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2z + 2s + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]

Since \( s = 2z \), we substitute \( s \) in the equation:

\[ 2z + 4(2z) = 10 \]
\[ 2z + 8z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find \( s \):

\[ s = 2z = 2(1) = 2 \]

Finally, the amount of oil is:

\[ 2s = 2(2) = 4 \]

So, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cars Joe has:**
   - Robert has 20 cars.
   - Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - Therefore, Joe has \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) cars.

2. **Calculate the number of cars Joe sells:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - 20% of 40 cars is \( 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \) cars.

3. **Calculate the number of cars Joe gives away:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold.
   - He sold 8 cars, so he gives away \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \) cars.

4. **Calculate the total number of cars Joe no longer has:**
   - Joe sold 8 cars and gave away 16 cars.
   - The total number of cars Joe no longer has is \( 8 + 16 = 24 \) cars.

5. **Determine the number of cars Joe has left:**
   - Joe originally had 40 cars.
   - After selling and giving away cars, he has \( 40 - 24 = 16 \) cars left.

Therefore, Joe remains with 16 cars.

"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to determine the total amount raised by the students. The total amount raised for the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

Since there are 20 students, and they each earned the same amount, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

$125,000 / 20 = $6,250

So, each student raised $6,250.

"To find out how much John makes in a full 7-day week, we need to calculate the total earnings based on the number of cycles, tasks per cycle, and the pay per task.

1. First, calculate the earnings per cycle:
   - Each cycle has 5 tasks.
   - Each task pays $1.20.
   - Earnings per cycle = 5 tasks * $1.20/task = $6.00.

2. Next, calculate the daily earnings:
   - John does 30 cycles a day.
   - Daily earnings = 30 cycles/day * $6.00/cycle = $180.00/day.

3. Finally, calculate the weekly earnings:
   - John works 7 days a week.
   - Weekly earnings = 7 days/week * $180.00/day = $1260.00/week.

So, John makes $1260.00 in a full 7-day week.

"To find out how many total points Sasha scored during both games, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.
2. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points.
3. In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.

Now, we add the points Sasha scored in both games:
- First game: 14 points
- Second game: 4 points

Total points scored by Sasha: \(14 + 4 = 18\)

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( P \) represent the number of cards PJ has.
2. Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.
3. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.
4. The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation: \( P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \).

Now, let's solve for \( P \):

\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P = 341 - 12 \]
\[ 7P = 329 \]
\[ P = \frac{329}{7} \]
\[ P = 47 \]

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Becca has:

\[ \text{Becca's cards} = 3P + 12 \]
\[ \text{Becca's cards} = 3 \times 47 + 12 \]
\[ \text{Becca's cards} = 141 + 12 \]
\[ \text{Becca's cards} = 153 \]

So, Becca has 153 cards.

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book and the amount she will be refunded by Amazon.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound for the book's weight.
   - The book weighs 4 pounds, so the cost for weight is \( 4 \times 0.35 = 1.40 \) dollars.
   - The shipping company also charges $0.08 per mile for the distance.
   - The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, so the cost for distance is \( 20 \times 0.08 = 1.60 \) dollars.
   - The total shipping cost is \( 1.40 + 1.60 = 3.00 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the refund amount:**
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price.
   - The book cost $32, so the refund amount is \( 32 \times 0.75 = 24 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total loss:**
   - Milly initially paid $32 for the book.
   - She will receive a refund of $24.
   - She will also pay $3 for shipping.
   - The total amount she will lose is \( 32 - 24 + 3 = 11 \) dollars.

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to follow the information step by step.

1. First, we know that Eva has saved $20.00.
2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.
3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find out how much more, we calculate 40% of Anthony's savings: 40% of $30.00 = 0.40 * $30.00 = $12.00.
4. Therefore, Roy has saved $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

So, Roy has $42.00.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the height that each character can lift a mountain, starting from Pompei and working our way up to Naruto.

1. **Pompei's lifting height**: Given as 1 inch.
2. **Saskay's lifting height**: Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches.
3. **Kagiyami's lifting height**: Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.
4. **Naruto's lifting height**: Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches.

Now, we need to convert the height from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot.

\[ 480 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

So, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

First, we calculate the distance he traveled in the first 4 hours:
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 8 miles/hour × 4 hours
Distance = 32 miles

Next, we calculate the distance he traveled in the following 6 hours:
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 8 miles/hour × 6 hours
Distance = 48 miles

Now, we add the two distances together to get the total distance:
Total Distance = 32 miles + 48 miles
Total Distance = 80 miles

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and then calculate the time it would take for the turtles to travel the same distance.

1. First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can assume that the total distance \(D\) is the same for all animals. The speed of one kangaroo \(S_k\) can be calculated as:
\[ D = 3 \times S_k \times 18 \]
\[ S_k = \frac{D}{3 \times 18} = \frac{D}{54} \]

2. The speed of a turtle \(S_t\) is half the speed of a kangaroo:
\[ S_t = \frac{1}{2} \times S_k = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{D}{54} = \frac{D}{108} \]

3. Now, we need to find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to travel the same distance \(D\). The total speed of 4 turtles is:
\[ 4 \times S_t = 4 \times \frac{D}{108} = \frac{4D}{108} = \frac{D}{27} \]

4. The time \(T\) it takes for 4 turtles to travel the distance \(D\) is:
\[ T = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{27}} = 27 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

"To find out how many clay dishes Jada, Rory, and Kora make together, we can start by determining how many dishes each person makes based on the information given.

1. Kora made 20 dishes.
2. Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made \(20 + 20 = 40\) dishes.
3. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made \(2 \times 40 = 80\) dishes.

Now, we add the number of dishes made by each person to find the total:

- Kora: 20 dishes
- Rory: 40 dishes
- Jada: 80 dishes

Total dishes = \(20 + 40 + 80 = 140\)

"To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after the trade-in, her part-time job pay, and her mom's contribution, and then subtract the total cost of the laptop after the trade-in discount.

1. The original cost of the laptop is $600.
2. The trade-in reduces the price by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she has $400 - $50 = $350 already.
4. She has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom gives her $80, so the total from these sources is $150 + $80 = $230.
5. The amount in her purse is the total she has minus the amount from her job and her mom: $350 - $230 = $120.

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"To find out how many apple slices are left, we first need to calculate the total number of slices Adam gets from slicing the apples.

From the large apples:
3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices

From the small apples:
5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices

Now, we add the slices from the large and small apples to get the total number of slices:
15 slices (from large apples) + 15 slices (from small apples) = 30 slices

Adam eats 15 slices, so we subtract those from the total:
30 slices - 15 slices eaten = 15 slices left

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first calculate the total amount of milk currently produced by the 3 cows.

Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, so 3 cows produce:
3 cows * 5 liters/cow/day = 15 liters/day

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The current production is 15 liters, so the additional amount needed is:
25 liters/day - 15 liters/day = 10 liters/day

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the extra 10 liters is:
10 liters/day ÷ 5 liters/cow/day = 2 cows

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

First, let's find out how many students are good at both subjects. Since there are 20 students in total, we can subtract the number of students who are good at math only and those who are good at English only from the total number of students:

20 (total students) - 5 (math only) - 8 (English only) = 7 students are good at both math and English.

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group will take, including their setup, performance, and exit, and then subtract the intermission time from the total concert time.

Each group's total time on stage is:
2 minutes (setup) + 6 minutes (performance) + 2 minutes (exit) = 10 minutes per group.

The concert is 2 hours long, which is:
2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.

Subtracting the 10-minute intermission from the total concert time gives us:
120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes available for performances.

Now, we divide the available performance time by the time each group takes:
110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups.

Therefore, Vicki can have 11 groups perform in the concert.

"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest earned and then add it to the original principal.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = P \times r \times t \]
where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial investment),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (in decimal form),
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years.

Given:
- \( P = 300 \) dollars,
- The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year. To convert this to a decimal rate, we divide by the principal: \( r = \frac{225}{300} = 0.75 \),
- \( t = 3 \) years.

Now, calculate the simple interest:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3 = 675 \]

The total amount after 3 years is the sum of the principal and the simple interest:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = P + \text{Simple Interest} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

"To find out how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we first need to determine how many rooms constitute one-half of the total number of rooms. 

The total number of rooms is 90, so one-half of the rooms is:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total time required to clean these 45 rooms. Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, the total time in minutes to clean 45 rooms is:
\[ 45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Volume of Water**: The initial volume of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. **Volume After Heavy Rain**: After a day of heavy rain, the volume of water doubles. Therefore, the volume of water becomes:
   \[
   4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Volume on the Third Day**: On the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons. Therefore, the volume of water on the third day is:
   \[
   8000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 14000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point on the third day is:

14000"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of people infected each day, starting with the initial ten people infected on day 0.

- **Day 0**: 10 people are initially infected.
- **Day 1**: Each of the 10 people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(10 \times 6 = 60\). The total number of infected people is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
- **Day 2**: Each of the 70 people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(70 \times 6 = 420\). The total number of infected people is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
- **Day 3**: Each of the 490 people infects 6 others, so the number of new infections is \(490 \times 6 = 2940\). The total number of infected people is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

Thus, after three days, the total number of people infected is 3430.

"To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total amount of tips Rafaela received. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate this as:

\[ \text{Rafaela's total tips} = 40 \times 20 = 800 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting this from Rafaela's total gives us Julieta's total tips:

\[ \text{Julieta's total tips} = 800 - 80 = 720 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find the total amount of tips both received together, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's totals:

\[ \text{Total tips} = 800 + 720 = 1520 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Claire's Badge Earnings:**
   - Claire earns 1 badge per month.
   - In 1 year (12 months), Claire earns \( 1 \times 12 = 12 \) badges.

2. **Amber's Badge Earnings:**
   - Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire.
   - Therefore, Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months.
   - In 1 year (12 months), Amber earns \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) badges.

3. **Wendy's Badge Earnings:**
   - Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.
   - In 1 year, Wendy earns \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) badges.

4. **Difference in Badge Earnings:**
   - The difference in the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber in 1 year is \( 36 - 6 = 30 \).

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame.

"Paige bakes from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours. 

In each hour, she can bake 2 banana bread loaves. So in 5 hours, she can bake:
5 hours * 2 loaves/hour = 10 loaves

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices from 10 loaves is:
10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, so the total amount raised from selling 80 slices is:
80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40.00

Therefore, Paige raised $40.00.

"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to calculate how many burritos were consumed and subtract that from the total number of burritos ordered.

1. First, calculate the total number of burritos given to the students:
   - There are 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos.
   - Total burritos given to students = 50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos

2. Next, add the number of burritos Mr. George ate:
   - Mr. George ate 20 burritos.
   - Total burritos consumed = 500 burritos (students) + 20 burritos (Mr. George) = 520 burritos

3. Finally, subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the total number of burritos ordered:
   - Total burritos ordered = 600 burritos
   - Total burritos leftover = 600 burritos - 520 burritos = 80 burritos

"To find out how many yellow cars the bumper car rink has, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of green cars:
   - The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars.
   - Since there are 12 red cars, the number of green cars is \(12 - 2 = 10\).

2. Determine the number of blue cars:
   - The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars.
   - Since there are 10 green cars, the number of blue cars is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

3. Calculate the total number of red, green, and blue cars:
   - Red cars: 12
   - Green cars: 10
   - Blue cars: 30
   - Total of red, green, and blue cars: \(12 + 10 + 30 = 52\)

4. Determine the number of yellow cars:
   - The rink has 75 cars in total.
   - The number of yellow cars is the total number of cars minus the number of red, green, and blue cars.
   - Number of yellow cars: \(75 - 52 = 23\)

Therefore, the number of yellow cars is 23.

"To solve this problem, let's set up the equations based on the information given:

Let \( S \) represent the number of books Sofie has, \( A \) represent the number of books Anne has, and \( F \) represent the number of books Fawn has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (Together, they have 85 books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, we can substitute the expression for \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation to express \( S \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 \]
\[ S = F + 13 \]

Now we have \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ S = F + 13 \]
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Next, substitute these expressions into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

"To find out how much 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water will cost, we first need to determine the cost per bottle for each.

For soda:
7 bottles cost $21.00, so the cost per bottle is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00 per bottle.

For water:
4 bottles cost $8.00, so the cost per bottle is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00 per bottle.

Now, we can calculate the cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
3 bottles of soda will cost 3 * $3.00 = $9.00.
2 bottles of water will cost 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

Adding these together, the total cost will be $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

"To determine how much money Isaias spent on the chickens he took to the market, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the profit formula to find the cost of the chickens.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.**

Isaias has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them:
\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = 300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180 \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.**

Each chicken is sold for $50:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

**Step 3: Use the profit formula to find the cost of the chickens.**

The profit formula is:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} \]

We know the profit is $2000 and the total revenue is $9000:
\[ 2000 = 9000 - \text{Total cost} \]

Solving for the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for $7000.

"To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we first need to determine how many glasses each of the boys sold. Since Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold a total of 32 glasses and Julie sold 14 glasses, we can subtract Julie's sales from the total to find out how many glasses the boys sold together:

32 glasses (total) - 14 glasses (Julie's sales) = 18 glasses (boys' sales combined)

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the boys' sales by 2 to find out how many each boy sold:

18 glasses (boys' sales combined) / 2 = 9 glasses (each boy's sales)

Now we can find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah by subtracting Micah's sales from Julie's sales:

14 glasses (Julie's sales) - 9 glasses (Micah's sales) = 5 glasses

So, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling her rope.
2. Determine the length of the new rope she can buy with the money.
3. Calculate the cost of the new rope.
4. Subtract the cost of the new rope from the total money she has to find out how much money she will have left over.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money from selling the rope.
Sarah's rope is 20 meters long, and she sells it for $2 per meter.
Total money from selling the rope = 20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Step 2: Determine the length of the new rope she can buy.
The new rope costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of new rope she can buy, we divide the total money by the cost per meter.
Length of new rope = Total money / Cost per meter = $40 / $1.5/meter = 26.67 meters (approximately)

Since Sarah can't buy a fraction of a meter, we'll assume she buys 26 meters of the new rope.

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the new rope.
Cost of new rope = 26 meters * $1.5/meter = $39

Step 4: Calculate the leftover money.
Money left over = Total money from selling the rope - Cost of new rope = $40 - $39 = $1

So, Sarah will have $1 left over after she buys the new rope.

"To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and then subtract this from her budget.

1. **Cost of bacon**: 5 packs at $10 in total.
   - Total cost of bacon = $10

2. **Cost of chicken**: 6 packets, each costing twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Cost of one pack of bacon = $10 / 5 = $2
   - Cost of one packet of chicken = $2 * 2 = $4
   - Total cost of chicken = 6 * $4 = $24

3. **Cost of strawberries**: 3 packs at $4 each.
   - Total cost of strawberries = 3 * $4 = $12

4. **Cost of apples**: 7 packs, each priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Cost of one pack of strawberries = $4
   - Cost of one pack of apples = $4 / 2 = $2
   - Total cost of apples = 7 * $2 = $14

Now, we sum up the total costs of all items:
- Total cost = Cost of bacon + Cost of chicken + Cost of strawberries + Cost of apples
- Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60

Finally, we subtract the total cost from Kelly's budget to find out how much money she has left:

"To find out how long Elaina's usual concerts run, we need to first subtract the time of the encore from the total runtime of the final concert. The final concert, including the encore, is 65 minutes long. The encore itself is 15 minutes long.

So, the length of the final concert without the encore is:
65 minutes - 15 minutes = 50 minutes

Since the final concert (excluding the encore) is twice as long as her usual concerts, we can find the length of her usual concerts by dividing the length of the final concert (excluding the encore) by 2.

50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes

Therefore, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot every day, we can start by calculating the cost of the yogurt and then use the total cost to find the cost of the carrots.

1. The salad costs $6.
2. The yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.
3. The total cost for the salad and the yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.
4. Ellen pays $11 in total for her daily food, so the cost for the two carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.
5. Since she eats two carrots, the cost for one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

The cost of one carrot every day is $1.

"To calculate Mark's weekly earnings after the pay raise, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Mark's new hourly wage: His original wage was $10 per hour, and he received a $2 raise, so his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.
2. Calculate the total number of hours Mark works in a week: He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so he works 8 * 5 = 40 hours a week.
3. Calculate his weekly earnings: Multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week, which is $12 * 40 = $480.

So, Mark makes $480 a week.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. Tasha made a total of $80 last month.
2. The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's.
3. The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's.
4. Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.

First, we need to determine how many times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn. Since Joe paid Tasha $6, and assuming this is the total amount he paid for the month, we can infer that this is the payment for the times she mowed his lawn. If we let \( J \) represent the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn, then:

\[ 6J = 6 \]
\[ J = 1 \]

So, Tasha mowed Joe's lawn once.

Next, we calculate the number of times she mowed Kamala's and Alba's lawns:
- She mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3 \times 1 = 3 \) times.
- She mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \) times.

Now, we need to determine how much she earned from mowing lawns. We know the total amount she made from mowing lawns is the sum of the payments from Joe, Kamala, and Alba. Let's assume the payment for mowing each lawn is the same as Joe's, which is $6 per lawn. Therefore:

- Earnings from Joe: \( 1 \times 6 = 6 \) dollars
- Earnings from Kamala: \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \) dollars
- Earnings from Alba: \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) dollars

Total earnings from mowing lawns:
\[ 6 + 18 + 30 = 54 \] dollars

Since Tasha made a total of $80 last month, the amount she made from lemonade sales is:
\[ 80 - 54 = 26 \] dollars

2. Carl’s weight is 16 kg more than Martin’s weight, so Carl’s weight is 55 kg + 16 kg = 71 kg.
3. Christian’s weight is 8 kg more than Carl’s weight, so Christian’s weight is 71 kg + 8 kg = 79 kg.
4. Harry is 5 kg less than Christian’s weight, so Harry’s weight is 79 kg - 5 kg = 74 kg.

Harry's weight is 74 kg."
"To calculate John's profit from renting out his car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out in a month.
2. Calculate the total income from renting the car.
3. Subtract the car payment from the total income to find the profit.

Step 1: Total number of hours rented per month
John rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time.
Total hours = 10 times * 3 hours/time = 30 hours

Step 2: Total income from renting the car
John gets paid $25 an hour.
Total income = 30 hours * $25/hour = $750

Step 3: Calculate the profit
Profit = Total income - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500 = $250

Therefore, John's profit from renting out his car is $250.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how many notebooks Martha originally had. We know that after buying 5 more notebooks, she had a total of 7 notebooks. So, before buying more, Martha had:
   \[ 7 - 5 = 2 \text{ notebooks} \]

2. Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. So, Joseph had:
   \[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ notebooks} \]

3. Now, Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph still has 6 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has:
   \[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

"To find the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed, we first need to calculate the distance Anis rowed. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. 

Dijana's distance: 50 miles
Anis's additional distance: 1/5 * 50 miles = 10 miles

So, Anis rowed 50 miles + 10 miles = 60 miles.

Now, we add the distances rowed by both Dijana and Anis to get the total distance:
Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis's distance
Total distance = 50 miles + 60 miles = 110 miles

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Pages read yesterday:**
   - Denise read 10 pages.
   - Daniel read 13 pages.

2. **Pages read today:**
   - Denise read 5 more pages than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
   - Daniel read 0 pages today.

3. **Total pages read:**
   - Denise's total pages read: \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.
   - Daniel's total pages read: \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

4. **Difference in pages read:**
   - The difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel is \(28 - 13 = 15\) pages.

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bowls of soup are left after Calvin and his family have eaten dinner.

First, let's calculate the total number of bowls of soup the pot can provide:
- The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.

Since Calvin and his wife are adults, and they will each have one bowl, that's 2 adult bowls. The two children will each have one bowl, which is 2 child bowls.

We need to convert the child bowls to adult bowls to make the calculation easier. Since 2 child bowls are equivalent to 1 adult bowl (because 8 child bowls = 4 adult bowls, so 2 child bowls = 1 adult bowl), the total consumption for the family is:
- 2 adult bowls (Calvin and his wife) + 1 adult bowl (2 children) = 3 adult bowls.

The pot can provide 4 adult bowls, so the number of adult bowls left after dinner is:
- 4 adult bowls - 3 adult bowls = 1 adult bowl.

Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, the leftover soup can provide 2 child bowls.

Therefore, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

"To find out how much William spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen he bought.

The cost of one notebook is $1.50, and William bought five notebooks, so the total cost for the notebooks is:
5 notebooks * $1.50/notebook = $7.50

The cost of one ballpen is $0.50, and William bought one ballpen, so the total cost for the ballpen is:
1 ballpen * $0.50/ballpen = $0.50

Now, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen to find the total amount William spent:
$7.50 + $0.50 = $8.00

Therefore, William spent a total of $8.00.

"To determine the total amount of material Jo needs, we first calculate the material required for the small masks and the large masks separately, and then sum these amounts.

1. **Material for Small Masks:**
   - Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \).
   - For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

2. **Material for Large Masks:**
   - Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \).
   - For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

3. **Total Material Needed:**
   - The total material required is the sum of the material for small masks and large masks.
   - Total material = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to calculate the total number of tickets she bought and then divide the total amount of money she spent by this number.

First, we determine the total number of tickets:
- There are 9 Fast and the Furious movies.
- Deepa has seen each movie 3 times.

Total number of tickets = Number of movies * Number of times seen per movie
Total number of tickets = 9 * 3 = 27 tickets

Next, we calculate the average price per ticket:
- Total amount spent = $216
- Total number of tickets = 27

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
Average price per ticket = $216 / 27 = $8

The average price she paid per ticket is $8.

"To determine Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total hours he spends on various activities and subtract that from the total hours in a day.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours a day.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up the hours spent on these activities:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Walking the dog: 1 hour

Total hours spent on activities = 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours

There are 24 hours in a day, so Harold's free time is:

He uses:
- 3 blue shoe boxes
- 1/3 of his red shoe boxes

First, calculate how many red shoe boxes 1/3 of 9 is:
1/3 of 9 = 9 / 3 = 3 red shoe boxes

Now, subtract the used shoe boxes from the original amounts:
- Blue shoe boxes left: 7 - 3 = 4
- Red shoe boxes left: 9 - 3 = 6

So, the total number of shoe boxes left is:
4 blue + 6 red = 10 shoe boxes

"To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many marbles Dean gives to Jamie, which is 1/5 of his total marbles.
2. Subtract the marbles given to Jamie from the total.
3. Subtract the 10 marbles given to Donald from the remaining total.

Let's do the math:

1. Dean has 30 marbles, and he gives 1/5 of them to Jamie. So, \( 30 \times \frac{1}{5} = 6 \) marbles are given to Jamie.
2. After giving 6 marbles to Jamie, Dean has \( 30 - 6 = 24 \) marbles left.
3. Dean then gives 10 marbles to Donald, so he has \( 24 - 10 = 14 \) marbles left.

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's denote Duncan's current age as \( D \) and Adam's current age as \( A \).
2. According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be written as:
   \[
   D - 8 = 2(A - 4)
   \]
3. We are also given that Duncan's current age \( D \) is 60. So, we substitute \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
   \[
   60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
   \]
4. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[
   52 = 2(A - 4)
   \]
5. Divide both sides by 2 to isolate \( A - 4 \):
   \[
   26 = A - 4
   \]
6. Add 4 to both sides to solve for \( A \):
   \[
   A = 30
   \]
7. Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
   \[
   A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
   \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

"To find the total number of acres that Farmer Brown's and Farmer Smith's farms have together, we first need to determine the size of each farm and then add them together.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. So, we calculate twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm and then add 100 acres:
Twice Farmer Brown's farm: 2 * 200 acres = 400 acres
Adding 100 acres: 400 acres + 100 acres = 500 acres

Now, we add the sizes of both farms together:
Farmer Brown's farm: 200 acres
Farmer Smith's farm: 500 acres
Total: 200 acres + 500 acres = 700 acres

The two farms together have 700 acres.

"To solve this, we need to calculate the total time John spends on an extreme Sudoku puzzle and then determine how many bottles of water he drinks during that time.

1. A normal Sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes.
2. An extreme Sudoku takes 4 times as long as a normal one, so:
   \( 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \)

3. John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, which is every 30 minutes. To find out how many bottles he drinks in 180 minutes, we divide the total time by the interval:

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( R \) as the number of red balloons.
- \( Y \) as the number of yellow balloons.

From the problem, we know:
- Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
- Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
- There are 20 red balloons.

We can set up the following equation based on the total pieces of bologna thrown:

\[ 2R + 3Y = 58 \]

We also know that \( R = 20 \). Substituting \( R \) into the equation:

\[ 2(20) + 3Y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]

Next, we solve for \( Y \):

\[ 3Y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3Y = 18 \]
\[ Y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ Y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is 6.

"To find out how much allowance Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide it by 2, since they both contributed equally.

1. The cost of the cake is $11.
2. The cost of 1 dozen (12) balloons, at $0.5 for 2 balloons, is calculated as follows:
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons per $0.5 = 6 units of $0.5
   - 6 units * $0.5 = $3
3. The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream, at $7 each, is:
   - 2 * $7 = $14

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14
- Total cost = $28

Since this total amount was the combined allowance of Julia and Nadine, and they both received the same amount, we divide the total by 2 to find out how much each received:
- Allowance per person = Total cost / 2
- Allowance per person = $28 / 2
- Allowance per person = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class.**

Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops. Therefore, the total number of lollipops sold is:
\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.**

Each lollipop was sold for $0.8. Therefore, the total revenue is:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollipop} = \$240 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.**

Each lollipop was bought for $0.5. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollipop} = \$150 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the profit.**

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours and then calculate the minimum number of berries he must pick up per trip to reach a total of 24 berries.

First, we know that one trip (down, pick berries, and back up) takes 4 hours. In 8 hours, the sloth can make:

8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips

Since the sloth can make 2 trips in 8 hours, and he needs to collect 24 berries in total, the minimum number of berries he must pick up per trip is:

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip

Therefore, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip is 12.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial amount of water in the tank.
2. Calculate the total amount of water used after 6 days.
3. Subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount to find the remaining water.

Step 1: The pool has 10,000 gallons of water. The tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, so the initial amount of water in the tank is:
\[ \text{Initial water in the tank} = \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ gallons} \]

Step 2: The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. Over 6 days, the total amount of water used is:
\[ \text{Total water used} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3,000 \text{ gallons} \]

Step 3: Subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount to find the remaining water:

"To find the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked, we need to calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins separately, and then sum them up.

1. **Calories in a mini cinnamon roll:**
   - A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
   - A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
   - Calories in a mini cinnamon roll = 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

2. **Total calories in 200 mini cinnamon rolls:**
   - Total calories = 200 rolls * 200 calories/roll = 40,000 calories.

3. **Calories in a mini blueberry muffin:**
   - A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
   - A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
   - Calories in a mini blueberry muffin = 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

4. **Total calories in 300 mini blueberry muffins:**
   - Total calories = 300 muffins * 150 calories/muffin = 45,000 calories.

5. **Total calories in all the pastries:**
   - Total calories = 40,000 calories (from cinnamon rolls) + 45,000 calories (from blueberry muffins) = 85,000 calories.

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to add up the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days and then divide by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she also removed twice as many as on Monday, which is again 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's add these numbers together to get the total:

39 (Monday) + 78 (Tuesday) + 78 (Wednesday) + 48 (Thursday) + 57 (Friday) = 300 Junebugs in total.

To find the average, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days:

300 Junebugs / 5 days = 60 Junebugs per day.

The average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60.

"To determine how much farther the bus went than the car, we first calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

For the bus:
- Speed: 60 miles per hour
- Time: 5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

For the car:
- Speed: 30 miles per hour
- Time: 8 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled:
- Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car.

"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of toys Sophie already had and then subtract that total from the new total number of toys, which is 62.

The number of building blocks is 31.
The number of stuffed animals is 8.
The number of stacking rings is 9.

Let's add these together:

31 (building blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48 toys.

Now, we subtract the total number of toys Sophie had before the bouncy balls from the new total:

62 (total toys now) - 48 (toys before bouncy balls) = 14 bouncy balls.

So, the tube contained 14 bouncy balls.

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( L \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + L + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   L = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = L + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( L \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]
\[
4J = 80
\]
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find \( L \) and \( P \):
\[
L = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

So, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs, we first calculate the amount of hay required for the goats and the sheep separately, and then sum these amounts.

1. Calculate the hay needed for the goats:
   - Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.
   - There are 15 goats.
   - Total hay for goats = 5 pounds/goat * 15 goats = 75 pounds.

2. Calculate the hay needed for the sheep:
   - Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs = 2 * 5 pounds = 10 pounds.
   - Each sheep needs 10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds.
   - There are 12 sheep.
   - Total hay for sheep = 7 pounds/sheep * 12 sheep = 84 pounds.

3. Calculate the total hay needed:
   - Total hay = hay for goats + hay for sheep = 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds.

"First, let's calculate John's total earnings for the week:

Earnings = Hourly Rate * Hours Worked
Earnings = 50 dollars/hour * 6 hours
Earnings = 300 dollars

Next, we'll subtract the amount he spends on gas and the amount he wants to deposit in the bank:

Remaining Money = Earnings - Cost of Gas - Bank Deposit
Remaining Money = 300 dollars - 50 dollars - 100 dollars
Remaining Money = 150 dollars

Now, we'll calculate the total cost of the 5 pencils:

Cost of Pencils = Number of Pencils * Cost per Pencil
Cost of Pencils = 5 * 10 dollars

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the time for each segment of James's journey.

1. **Swimming the first part:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - 60% of 20 miles is \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time to swim 12 miles is \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \) hours.

2. **Resting on the island:**
   - James rests for half as long as the time he spent swimming the first part.
   - Rest time is \( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \) hours.

3. **Swimming the remaining part:**
   - The remaining distance is \( 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \) miles.
   - James swims the remaining distance at half his original speed, which is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour} \).

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can set up the following equations based on the information provided:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) in the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Occupancy**: The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied.
   - Initial occupied beds = 1000 * (1/5) = 200 beds

2. **Daily Admissions**: 50 patients are admitted each day.

3. **Time Period**: We need to calculate the occupancy after 2 weeks (14 days).
   - Total patients admitted in 14 days = 50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients

4. **Total Occupied Beds After 14 Days**: 
   - Total occupied beds = Initial occupied beds + Patients admitted in 14 days
   - Total occupied beds = 200 + 700 = 900 beds

5. **Unoccupied Beds**:
   - Unoccupied beds = Total capacity - Total occupied beds
   - Unoccupied beds = 1000 - 900 = 100 beds

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100.

   - Second day: 13 holes
   - Third day: 8 holes, but 2 holes were filled in, so the net holes dug on the third day is 8 - 2 = 6 holes.

   Total holes by the end of the third day = 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes.

2. Determine the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day:
   - The problem states that by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes was four times the number of holes at the end of the first day.
   - Number of holes at the end of the first day = 10 holes.
   - Therefore, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day = 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

3. Calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day:
   - Total holes by the end of the fourth day = 40 holes.
   - Total holes by the end of the third day = 29 holes.
   - Holes dug on the fourth day = 40 - 29 = 11 holes.

The pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

"To find out how much the travel costs, we need to calculate 50% more than the cost of the supplies. The cost of the supplies is $400.

First, we calculate 50% of $400:
50% of $400 = 0.50 * $400 = $200

Then, we add this amount to the original cost of the supplies to find the total cost of travel:
$400 + $200 = $600

So, the travel costs $600.

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( A \) represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
2. Let \( S \) represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
3. Let \( W \) represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

From the problem, we have the following equations:

1. \( A + S + W = 339 \) (Total Pokemon caught)
2. \( A = S + 5 \) (Alex has caught 5 more than Stan)
3. \( S = 4W - 13 \) (Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to express everything in terms of \( S \) and \( W \):

\[ (S + 5) + S + W = 339 \]
\[ 2S + W + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + W = 334 \]

Next, we substitute the third equation into the equation \( 2S + W = 334 \):

\[ 2S + (S + 13)/4 = 334 \]
\[ 2S + S/4 + 13/4 = 334 \]
\[ 8S/4 + S/4 + 13/4 = 334 \]
\[ 9S/4 + 13/4 = 334 \]
\[ 9S + 13 = 1336 \]
\[ 9S = 1323 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of episodes and then calculate the total time spent watching all episodes.

1. Each episode is 20 minutes long.
2. The number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, the number of episodes is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).

Now, we calculate the total time spent watching all episodes:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Number of episodes} \times \text{Length of each episode} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

"To determine the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction, as the bird's final destination is her southern home.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: North
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled south by subtracting the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:

- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \)
- Distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \)

Net distance traveled south:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:

"To find out how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she had and then subtract the number of brownies that were eaten.

1. Greta made a batch of one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself. That's 12 brownies.
2. She was sent home with 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office party. That's 6 brownies.
3. Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies for the surprise party. That's 48 brownies.
4. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. That's 18 brownies.

Now, let's add up all the brownies she had:

12 (from herself) + 6 (from the office) + 48 (from friends) = 66 brownies

Next, we subtract the brownies that were eaten:

66 (total brownies) - 18 (eaten) = 48 brownies

So, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day.

"To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of oranges Mrs. Harrington initially had.
2. Determine how many oranges she gave away to her mom and sister.
3. Calculate how many oranges she kept for herself.
4. Subtract the oranges given away and kept from the total to find out how many she sold.

Step 1: Total number of oranges
- Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges.
- Each box contains 20 oranges.
- Total oranges = 12 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges.

Step 2: Oranges given away
- She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister.
- Total boxes given away = 2 boxes + 2 boxes = 4 boxes.
- Oranges given away = 4 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 80 oranges.

Step 3: Oranges kept
- She kept 1/4 of the oranges.
- Oranges kept = 1/4 * 240 oranges = 60 oranges.

Step 4: Oranges sold
- Oranges sold = Total oranges - Oranges given away - Oranges kept

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the width of the flowers to feet**: Since 12 inches is equal to 1 foot, each flower is 1 foot wide.

2. **Calculate the total space required for one flower and the space between it and the next flower**: Each flower requires 1 foot of space, and there needs to be 1.5 feet of space between each flower. Therefore, the total space required for one flower and the space between it and the next flower is:
   \[
   1 \text{ foot (flower)} + 1.5 \text{ feet (space)} = 2.5 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed**: The flower bed is 111 feet long. To find out how many flowers can fit, we divide the length of the flower bed by the total space required for one flower and the space between it and the next flower:
   \[
   \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/flower}} = 44.4 \text{ flowers}

"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil, and they are planting 4 sunflowers:
4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds

Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil, and they are planting 10 carnations:
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Now, we add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
12 pounds (for sunflowers) + 15 pounds (for carnations) = 27 pounds

The total amount of soil in the bag is 30 pounds. Subtract the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total:

1. Calculate the amount Jessica sets aside each month for shoes.
2. Determine the total amount set aside in a year.
3. Calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy with the total amount.

Step 1: Calculate the monthly savings for shoes.
Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for shoes.
25% of $2,000.00 = 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00

Step 2: Determine the total amount set aside in a year.
Jessica saves $500.00 each month, so in a year (12 months), she will save:
$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

Step 3: Calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy.
Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so the number of pairs she can buy is:
$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6

"To determine the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the task into two parts: peeling and sauteing.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, we calculate the time required as follows:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sauteing the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To saute 90 shrimp, we calculate the time required as follows:
     \[
     \text{Time to saute 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to peel and saute 90 shrimp is the sum of the time to peel and the time to saute:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the temperature changes step by step:

1. **Cooling on low for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 3 hours, the temperature drops by \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) degrees.

2. **Cooling on high for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   - In 4 hours, the temperature drops by \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) degrees.

3. **Warming up for 2 hours with no air conditioner:**
   - The room warms up by 2 degrees per hour.
   - In 2 hours, the temperature rises by \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) degrees.

Now, we sum up the temperature changes:
- Total cooling: \( 6 + 12 = 18 \) degrees.
- Total warming: \( 4 \) degrees.

The net temperature change is:
- \( 18 - 4 = 14 \) degrees.

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet a second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.

4. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet a second time, and the comet appears every 75 years, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of trips the first plane makes:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 44 \times 2 = 88 \) trips.

2. **Determine the distribution of the first plane's trips:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - The remaining one-quarter of its flights are split equally between France and Germany.

3. **Calculate the number of trips to Greece:**
   - Three-quarters of 88 trips: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \) trips to Greece.

4. **Calculate the number of remaining trips:**
   - The remaining trips are \( 88 - 66 = 22 \) trips.

5. **Determine the number of trips to France and Germany:**
   - The remaining 22 trips are split equally between France and Germany.
   - Therefore, the number of trips to France is \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \).

So, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is 11.

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we first need to determine the duration of each wolf's howl.

1. Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, which is \(20 \times 2 = 40\) seconds.
3. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, which is \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Now, we add up the durations of all three wolves' howls:
\[ 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert the total time into minutes:
\[ 120 \text{ seconds} \div 60 = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and then subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6. His father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is 2 * $6 = $12.

The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 (from his mother) + $12 (from his father) = $18.

The cost of the trousers is $30. Therefore, the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings is $30 - $18 = $12.

"To find Wilfred's age, we first need to determine the average age of the group and then use the information about Helene's age to find Wilfred's age.

1. The total age of the children is 20.
2. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. So, the average age is \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) years.
3. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, so Helene is \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) years old.
4. We know the ages of Akbar (3 years), Alessandro (4 years), and Helene (10 years). To find Wilfred's age, we subtract the sum of the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene from the total age of the group.

So, Wilfred's age is \( 20 - (3 + 4 + 10) = 20 - 17 = 3 \) years.

"To determine how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected from all other sources and then multiply that by three, as the lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates.

1. Walter collects $500 from his neighbors.
2. Walter collects $1500 from an online fund.
3. Walter's friend donates $200.

First, we add up the amounts collected from the neighbors, the online fund, and the friend:

\[ 500 + 1500 + 200 = 2200 \]

The lawyer will donate three times this amount:

\[ 3 \times 2200 = 6600 \]

Therefore, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of cookies brought by the guests:**
   - There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies.
   - Total cookies = 100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies.

2. **Determine how many cookies were given to the church:**
   - The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church.
   - Cookies given to the church = 1/2 * 1500 cookies = 750 cookies.

3. **Calculate the number of people in the church who received cookies:**
   - Each person in the church received 15 cookies.
   - Number of people in the church = 750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people.

Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is 50.

"To solve this problem, let's first establish the relationship between the sizes of the slices for the adults and the kids. Let the size of each kid's slice be \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

The total watermelon can be represented as the sum of all the slices. There are 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total watermelon is:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

This means the entire watermelon is divided into 8 parts of size \( x \).

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \), and since the whole watermelon is \( 8x \), the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is:
\[ \frac{2x}{8x} \times 100\% = \frac{2}{8} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he will spend on rounds and appointments, and then subtract this from his total available time at the clinic.

1. **Time spent on rounds:**
   - Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients.
   - Each inpatient check takes 20 minutes.
   - Total time for rounds = 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes.

2. **Time spent on appointments:**
   - Doctor Jones has 10 appointments.
   - Each appointment takes 30 minutes.
   - Total time for appointments = 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes.

3. **Total time spent on rounds and appointments:**
   - Total time = 180 minutes (rounds) + 300 minutes (appointments) = 480 minutes.

4. **Convert total time spent to hours:**
   - 480 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 8 hours.

5. **Time left for updating records:**
   - Doctor Jones has 9 hours available at the clinic.
   - Time left = 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as \( x \).

Lisa sold \( 3.5 \) boxes, so she sold \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold \( 4.5 \) boxes, so he sold \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold \( 64 \) chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:

\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by \( 8 \):

\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]

\[ x = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the costs and the number of sessions. However, the question does not specify the revenue or the fee charged per student per session, which is necessary to calculate earnings. Instead, I will calculate the total cost of operating the studio for a month, assuming 4 weeks in a month.

1. Calculate the cost of renting the studio per session:
   - Cost per session = $25

2. Calculate the cost per student per session:
   - Cost per student per session = $1.50

3. Calculate the total cost per session for 10 students:
   - Total cost per session for students = 10 students * $1.50 = $15

4. Calculate the total cost per session (studio rental + student costs):
   - Total cost per session = $25 (studio) + $15 (students) = $40

5. Calculate the total cost per week (3 sessions):
   - Total cost per week = 3 sessions * $40 = $120

6. Calculate the total cost for a month (4 weeks):
   - Total cost for a month = 4 weeks * $120 = $480

Since the question asks for the expected earnings and we only have the cost information, we can only provide the total cost. If you meant to ask for the total cost, the answer is:

$480

If you need the earnings, please provide the fee charged per student per session."
"To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we first need to determine how many chocolate bars are in each of their boxes.

For Peter:
- He has 4 boxes and a total of 64 chocolate bars.
- The number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes is \( \frac{64}{4} = 16 \).

For Martha:
- She has 7 boxes and a total of 56 chocolate bars.
- The number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes is \( \frac{56}{7} = 8 \).

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes from the number in each of Peter's boxes:
- \( 16 - 8 = 8 \).

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

2. Calculate the number of babies born each month.
3. Calculate the total number of babies born in a year.
4. Add the total number of babies born in a year to the initial population to find the final population.

Step 1: Determine the number of female porcupines.
The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population. The total population is 50.
\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of babies born each month.
Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
\[ \text{Babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of babies born in a year.
There are 12 months in a year.
\[ \text{Total babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume to gallons using the given conversion factor.
3. Calculate the cost based on the price per gallon.

Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.
The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) can be calculated using the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 25 \, \text{ft} \times 14 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \]
\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Step 2: Convert the volume to gallons.
The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the volume in gallons.
\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 5.9 \]
\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \]

Step 3: Calculate the cost.
The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon.
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{USD/gallon} \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \, \text{USD} \]

The cost to fill the pool is:

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge of 28%.

1. **Calculate the charge after the last 3 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 1 hour, the charge is \( x - 0.07x = 0.93x \).
   - After 2 hours, the charge is \( 0.93x - 0.07(0.93x) = 0.93^2x \).
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( 0.93^2x - 0.07(0.93^2x) = 0.93^3x \).

   Given that the final charge is 28%, we have:
   \[
   0.93^3x = 0.28
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.93^3}
   \]
   \[
   x \approx \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]
   So, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

2. **Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 1 hour, the charge is \( y - 0.09y = 0.91y \).
   - After 2 hours, the charge is \( 0.91y - 0.09(0.91y) = 0.91^2y \).
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( 0.91^2y - 0.09(0.91^2y) = 0.91^3y \).
   - After 4 hours, the charge is \( 0.91^3y - 0.09(0.91^3y) = 0.91^4y \).
   - After 5 hours, the charge is \( 0.91^4y - 0.09(0.91^4y) = 0.91^5y \).

   Given that the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was 34.8%, we have:
   \[
   0.91^5y = 0.348
   \]
   Solving for \( y \):
   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.91^5}
   \]
   \[
   y \approx \frac{0.348}{0.624032} \approx 0.558

"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, we first need to calculate the total amount she needs to save, which is 20% of $10,000.

\[ \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \]

Next, we calculate Janet's total earnings per hour, which include both her wages and tips.

\[ \text{Total earnings per hour} = 10 + 15 = 25 \]

Now, we calculate her total earnings per week, given that she works 40 hours a week.

\[ \text{Total earnings per week} = 25 \times 40 = 1000 \]

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount needed by her weekly earnings.

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \]

So, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save up the down payment.

"To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased.

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50 each = $1.50
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.50 each = $2.00
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00 each = $2.00
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75 each = $3.75

Now, let's add up the total cost of these fruits:

$1.50 (peaches) + $2.00 (pears) + $2.00 (kiwis) + $3.75 (apples) = $9.25

Jamaar has $10, so the remaining amount he can spend on plums is:

$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Since plums cost $0.25 each, the number of plums he can buy is:

$0.75 / $0.25 = 3

"To find out how many portraits and selfies Olivia had, we need to first determine how many pictures were in each album. Since she put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Now, we know that 3 albums were selfies and 2 albums were portraits. To find out the total number of selfies and portraits, we multiply the number of pictures per album by the number of albums for each category:

Selfies: 3 albums * 9 pictures/album = 27 pictures
Portraits: 2 albums * 9 pictures/album = 18 pictures

Adding the selfies and portraits together gives us the total number of selfies and portraits:

27 selfies + 18 portraits = 45 pictures

So, Olivia had 45 pictures that were either selfies or portraits.

Next, we use this rate to find the time it takes to read 18 pages:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{18 \text{ pages}}{3 \text{ pages/10 minutes}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{18 \text{ pages} \times 10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{3} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( S \) be the number of small stuffed animals sold.
   - Let \( L \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold.
   - The price of a small stuffed animal is $4.
   - The price of a large stuffed animal is \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

2. **Set up the relationships:**
   - Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so \( S = 2L \).
   - The total earnings from the sales are $120.

3. **Set up the equation for total earnings:**
   - The total earnings from small stuffed animals is \( 4S \).
   - The total earnings from large stuffed animals is \( 12L \).
   - The total earnings equation is \( 4S + 12L = 120 \).

4. **Substitute \( S = 2L \) into the total earnings equation:**
   - \( 4(2L) + 12L = 120 \)
   - \( 8L + 12L = 120 \)
   - \( 20L = 120 \)

5. **Solve for \( L \):**
   - \( L = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \)

6. **Find \( S \):**
   - \( S = 2L = 2 \times 6 = 12 \)

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"To find out how much money Suzanne has left from her earnings, we need to calculate her total earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes, and then subtract the amount she gave to her sisters.

First, calculate the earnings from the cookies:
80 cookies * $1/cookie = $80

Next, calculate the earnings from the cupcakes:
60 cupcakes * $4/cupcake = $240

Now, add the earnings from both the cookies and cupcakes to find the total earnings:
$80 + $240 = $320

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so the total amount given to her sisters is:
2 sisters * $10/sister = $20

Finally, subtract the amount given to her sisters from the total earnings to find out how much money Suzanne has left:
$320 - $20 = $300

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe in one day.

1. A dwarf mines 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
2. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.
3. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which is 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, we calculate how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in one day with steel pickaxes:

40 dwarves * 36 pounds/dwarf/day = 1440 pounds/day

Finally, we calculate the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves in a month with 30 days:

1440 pounds/day * 30 days = 43200 pounds

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the price per sandwich for the packages with known prices and then apply that rate to the 8-sandwich package.

1. For the first package, the cost is $3 for 2 sandwiches. The price per sandwich is:
   \[ \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich} \]

2. For the second package, the cost is $6 for 4 sandwiches. The price per sandwich is:
   \[ \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich} \]

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is consistent across all package sizes. Therefore, the cost for the package with 8 sandwiches, at $1.5 per sandwich, is:
   \[ 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

"Tom initially pays $1000 towards the new bedroom set, which reduces the total cost from $3000 to $2000. The remaining $2000 is what he needs to pay off with a 10% monthly interest rate.

However, the way the question is phrased, it seems to suggest that Tom is paying 10% of the remaining balance each month, not that the 10% is an interest rate on the debt. If we interpret it as Tom paying 10% of the remaining balance each month, then the amount he pays each month will decrease over time as the balance decreases.

But if we interpret it as a monthly payment of 10% of the original remaining balance, then the calculation is straightforward:

10% of $2000 = 0.10 * $2000 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month.

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of the different scenarios where he would not have to turn it in and then subtract this from 100%.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - If there is a substitute, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. So, the probability of not turning in homework due to a substitute is 0.50.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - If the normal teacher is there, there are two further scenarios to consider:
     - **Extension for the whole class:**
       - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.40
       - If the normal teacher gives an extension, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. So, the probability of not turning in homework due to a class extension is 0.50 * 0.40 = 0.20.
     - **Personal Extension:**
       - Probability of the normal teacher not giving a class extension: 60% or 0.60
       - If the normal teacher does not give a class extension, there is a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension.
       - Probability of getting a personal extension: 20% or 0.20
       - So, the probability of not turning in homework due to a personal extension is 0.50 * 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.06.

3. **Total Probability of Not Turning in Homework:**
   - Sum of the probabilities of the scenarios where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
     - Substitute teacher: 0.50
     - Class extension: 0.20
     - Personal extension: 0.06
   - Total probability of not turning in homework: 0.50 + 0.20 + 0.06 = 0.76

4. **Probability of Turning in Homework:**
   - The probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is the complement of the total probability of not turning in homework:
     - 1 - 0.76 = 0.24 or 24%

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 24%.

"To determine how many tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats available for friends and family by subtracting the seats for graduates and faculty from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.
2. Divide the number of seats available for friends and family by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate can receive.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total seats in the Fine Arts Center: 6000
2. Seats for graduates: 950
3. Seats for faculty: 300

Total seats for friends and family = Total seats - (Seats for graduates + Seats for faculty)
Total seats for friends and family = 6000 - (950 + 300)
Total seats for friends and family = 6000 - 1250
Total seats for friends and family = 4750

Now, we divide the total seats for friends and family by the number of graduates:

Tickets per graduate = Total seats for friends and family / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 4750 / 950
Tickets per graduate = 5

Each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the number of soda bottles he will place and the time it will take to move between them.

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - Number of bottles = 24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles.

2. **Calculate the time to move between bottles:**
   - Richard starts at the first bottle, so he will move from the first to the second, second to the third, and so on, until the last bottle.
   - He will move between 7 intervals (since there are 8 bottles, he will move 7 times).
   - Time to move between each bottle = 5 seconds.
   - Total time to move between bottles = 7 intervals * 5 seconds per interval = 35 seconds.

3. **Total time to set off all the soda fountains:**
   - Richard will drop the candy into the first bottle immediately, so no additional time is needed for the first bottle.
   - The total time is the time to move between the bottles.

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is 35 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Jim's college education, including the loans and the income he did not earn while in school. Then, we need to determine how long it will take for him to earn that amount with his new, higher salary.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the loans:**
   - Jim takes $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.
   - Total loans = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000

2. **Calculate the income lost while in school:**
   - Jim could have earned $25,000 per year if he had not gone to college.
   - Income lost over 4 years = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000

3. **Calculate the total cost of college:**
   - Total cost = Total loans + Income lost
   - Total cost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000

4. **Determine Jim's new income after college:**
   - His college degree tripled his income.
   - New income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

5. **Calculate the net additional income per year after college:**
   - Net additional income = New income - Previous income
   - Net additional income = $75,000 - $25,000 = $50,000 per year

6. **Determine how long it will take to earn the total cost of college:**
   - Time to earn the total cost = Total cost / Net additional income
   - Time to earn the total cost = $300,000 / $50,000 = 6 years

Therefore, it will take Jim 6 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"To determine how much fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces he will use. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each piece of fabric will be:
6 feet (length of the bed) + 2 feet = 8 feet

And the width of each piece of fabric will be:
8 feet (width of the bed) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
8 feet (length) * 10 feet (width) = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered on each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: The post office delivered 425 letters.
2. **Tuesday**: They delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
   - One-fifth of Monday's letters: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - Letters delivered on Tuesday: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)
3. **Wednesday**: They delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.
   - Twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday: \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \)
   - Letters delivered on Wednesday: \( 204 + 5 = 209 \)

Now, we sum the letters delivered over the three days:

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the equation based on the total number of balls:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we need to find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the 3 years from 2007 to 2010. The formula for depreciation at a constant rate is:

\[ \text{Final Value} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{rate})^{\text{number of years}} \]

Here, the initial value is $20,000, the rate of depreciation is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years is 3.

Let's plug in the values:

\[ \text{Final Value} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Value} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Value} = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ \text{Final Value} = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is $9860.78.

"To find out how much Alison spent on athletic gear, let's break down the costs of each item she bought:

1. Tank top: $10
2. Running shorts: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. Tennis shoes: Originally $48, but on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. Athletic socks: $8, but with a $2 off coupon, so $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:

$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55

So, Alison spent a total of $55 on athletic gear.

"To determine the cost of renovating your kitchen floor with new square tiles, we need to calculate the total number of tiles required and then multiply that by the cost per tile.

1. **Calculate the number of tiles needed:**
   - Each tile covers an area of 1 square foot (since each side is 1 foot, the area is 1 ft x 1 ft = 1 SqFt).
   - The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
   - Therefore, the number of tiles needed is 200 tiles (200 SqFt / 1 SqFt per tile).

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each tile costs $12.
   - The total cost is the number of tiles multiplied by the cost per tile: 200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400.

The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor is $2400.

"To find out how much James pays for insurance a year after his accident, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.
2. Multiply the increased monthly cost by 12 to find the annual cost.

First, let's calculate the increased monthly cost. The normal cost is $120 a month, and the increase is 60% of this amount.

60% of $120 is calculated as:
\[ 0.60 \times 120 = 72 \]

So, the increased monthly cost is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Next, we calculate the annual cost by multiplying the increased monthly cost by 12:
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for his insurance.

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to calculate the total amount of food consumed per day and then divide the total amount of food by this daily consumption.

1. First, calculate the total amount of food consumed per feeding:
   - Each cat eats 60 grams per feeding.
   - There are 3 cats.
   - Therefore, for one feeding, the total amount of food consumed is \( 60 \text{ grams/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 180 \text{ grams} \).

2. Since the cats are fed twice a day, the total amount of food consumed per day is:
   - \( 180 \text{ grams/feeding} \times 2 \text{ feedings/day} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \).

3. Now, to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, divide the total amount of food by the daily consumption:
   - \( 720 \text{ grams} \div 360 \text{ grams/day} = 2 \text{ days} \).

The 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many slices Jake ate:**
   - Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake.
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Therefore, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices.

2. **Determine how many slices Silvia ate:**
   - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake.
   - Jake ate 7 slices.
   - Therefore, Silvia ate \(2 \times 7 = 14\) slices.

3. **Calculate the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Jake ate 7 slices.
   - Silvia ate 14 slices.
   - Total slices eaten = \(10 + 7 + 14 = 31\).

4. **Verify the total number of slices available:**
   - There were 4 pizzas, each with 8 slices.
   - Total slices available = \(4 \times 8 = 32\).

Since the total slices eaten (31) is less than the total slices available (32), the calculation is consistent.

The total number of slices they ate is:

"Let's denote the time Donovan spent on his part of the meal as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time spent on the meal is the sum of the time Betsy and Donovan each spent, which is 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which is 18 minutes longer, took:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

"To determine the total cost of postage for Anthony's coupons, we need to calculate the cost for both the small and big coupons and then sum these costs.

1. **Calculate the number of big coupons:**
   Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since he is sending out 700 small coupons:
   \[
   \text{Number of big coupons} = 2 \times 700 = 1400
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost for the small coupons:**
   Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for the small coupons is:
   \[
   \text{Cost for small coupons} = 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost for the big coupons:**
   Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for the big coupons is:
   \[
   \text{Cost for big coupons} = 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   The total cost for all the coupons is the sum of the costs for the small and big coupons:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents}
   \]

5. **Convert the total cost to dollars:**
   Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar:
   \[
   \text{Total cost in dollars} = \frac{24500}{100} = 245 \text{ dollars}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses Jenny bought and then determine how much change she should receive in quarters.

First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since the price is $15 for a dozen (12 roses), we can find the cost of 15 roses by calculating the cost of 12 roses and the cost of the additional 3 roses.

- Cost of 12 roses: $15
- Cost of 3 roses: 3 roses * $2/rose = $6

So, the total cost for 15 roses is:
\[ 15 + 6 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Jenny arrived with five 5 dollar bills, which totals:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount of change she should receive is:
\[ 25 - 21 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the 4 dollars into quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25, so:
\[ 4 \text{ dollars} \div 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 16 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.

2. **Number of Trekking bikes sold**:
   - Half of the total bikes sold were Trekking bikes.
   - \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \) Trekking bikes.

3. **Number of BMX bikes sold**:
   - 15% of the total bikes sold were BMX bikes.
   - \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \) BMX bikes.

4. **Number of MTB bikes sold**:
   - The rest of the bikes sold were MTB bikes.
   - Total bikes sold - Trekking bikes - BMX bikes = MTB bikes.
   - \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \) MTB bikes.

5. **Price of each type of bike**:
   - MTB: $500
   - BMX: \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \) dollars
   - Trekking: $450

6. **Total earnings from each type of bike**:
   - Earnings from MTB bikes: \( 105 \times 500 = 52,500 \) dollars
   - Earnings from BMX bikes: \( 45 \times 250 = 11,250 \) dollars
   - Earnings from Trekking bikes: \( 150 \times 450 = 67,500 \) dollars

7. **Total earnings from all bikes**:
   - \( 52,500 + 11,250 + 67,500 = 131,250 \) dollars

Marcel earned a total of $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net number of bales added to the field each hour and then multiply that by the number of hours worked.

Each hour, the farmer makes 5 bales, and the truck picks up 3 bales. The net number of bales added to the field each hour is:

5 bales made - 3 bales picked up = 2 bales added per hour

Since the farmer and the truck driver work for 6 hours, the total number of bales left in the field at the end of the day is:

2 bales added per hour * 6 hours = 12 bales

"To determine how many hours a week John spends learning, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class during the week and then add the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday.

1. **Calculate the total minutes spent in class during the week:**
   - John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes each day, which totals 8 classes per day.
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.
   - He goes to class for 5 days a week.

   Total minutes per day = 8 classes/day * 40 minutes/class = 320 minutes/day
   Total minutes per week = 320 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes/week

2. **Calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.

   Extra learning time per day (Saturday and Sunday) = 1600 minutes/week * 1/16 = 100 minutes/day
   Total extra learning time for both days = 100 minutes/day * 2 days = 200 minutes

3. **Calculate the total weekly learning time:**
   - Total minutes spent learning in a week = 1600 minutes (class) + 200 minutes (extra learning) = 1800 minutes

4. **Convert the total minutes to hours:**
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - Total hours = 1800 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 30 hours

Therefore, John spends 30 hours a week learning.

"To determine how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial height from which the ball is dropped.
2. Determine the height of the first bounce.
3. Calculate the height of the second bounce.

**Step 1: Initial height**
The ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony, and each story is 24 feet high. Therefore, the initial height is:
\[ 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

**Step 2: Height of the first bounce**
The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height. So, the height of the first bounce is:
\[ 72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

**Step 3: Height of the second bounce**
The ball again bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height of the first bounce. So, the height of the second bounce is:
\[ 48 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the ball goes 32 feet high on its second bounce.

2. The second child is two inches taller than the first child:
   \( 72 + 2 = 74 \) inches tall.

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child:
   \( 74 - 5 = 69 \) inches tall.

4. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child:
   \( 69 + 3 = 72 \) inches tall.

The height of the fourth child is 72 inches.

"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine how many bags of apples were sold and then multiply that by the price per bag.

1. First, we calculate the number of bags sold:
   - Total apples sold: 2000
   - Apples per bag: 10
   - Number of bags sold = Total apples sold / Apples per bag = 2000 / 10 = 200 bags

2. Next, we calculate the total earnings:
   - Price per bag: $5
   - Total earnings = Number of bags sold * Price per bag = 200 * 5 = $1000

The orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. This means that before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 kilograms of meat left after the velociraptors had their share.

2. The velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex, which means the 270 kilograms is half of what was there before the velociraptors ate. Therefore, before the velociraptors ate, there were \(270 \times 2 = 540\) kilograms of meat.

3. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so the 540 kilograms is half of the original amount of meat on the triceratops. Therefore, the original amount of meat on the triceratops was \(540 \times 2 = 1080\) kilograms.

"To determine the cost to paint the room, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

The north and south walls are each 10 feet wide by 8 feet high, so the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are each 5 feet wide by 8 feet high, so the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

The total area to be painted is the sum of the areas of all four walls:
\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

A gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, so the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \times 12 = 144 \]

"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to calculate the probability of picking a shaken can from the remaining sodas.

Initially, there are 12 sodas in total, with 3 of them being shaken. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda, leaving 11 sodas (3 shaken and 8 unshaken). Ellen's brother then takes 1 shaken and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 10 sodas in total (2 shaken and 8 - 2 = 6 unshaken).

The probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left:

\[ P(\text{shaken}) = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas left}} = \frac{2}{10} = \frac{1}{5} \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ P(\text{shaken}) \times 100 = \frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20\% \]

60 miles/hour * 3 hours = 180 miles

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is:
60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour

In 3 hours, the second train will have traveled:
30 miles/hour * 3 hours = 90 miles

The total distance between the two trains after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:
180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

"To determine how many people Billy helps, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy takes off.
3. Calculate the number of days Billy works.
4. Calculate the total number of people he helps based on his working days and the rate at which he helps people.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.

Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy takes off.**

Billy takes 20% of the days off.

Number of days off = 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days

**Step 3: Calculate the number of days Billy works.**

Number of working days = Total days - Days off = 50 - 10 = 40 days

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of people he helps.**

Billy helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day.

People helped per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day

Total people helped = Number of working days * People helped per day = 40 days * 6 people/day = 240 people

"To find Jeff's age, we can start by determining Martha's age. Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate Martha's age as follows:

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4 years
Martha's age = 24 years - 4 years
Martha's age = 20 years

Now that we know Martha is 20 years old, we can find Jeff's age. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so:

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10 years
Jeff's age = 20 years + 10 years
Jeff's age = 30 years

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old.

"To find out how many hours Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to after 5 days, we need to calculate the total time spent on breaks and lunch each day and then multiply by the number of days.

First, let's calculate the total break and lunch time per day:
- Lunch: 30 minutes
- Breaks: 2 breaks * 15 minutes each = 30 minutes

Total time per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes

Now, convert the total time per day into hours:
60 minutes = 1 hour

Next, calculate the total time over 5 days:
1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours

So, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours.

"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times the distance that Amber ran, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

Micah's distance = 3.5 * Amber's distance
Micah's distance = 3.5 * 8 miles
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Now, we know the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We can find Ahito's distance by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - (Amber's distance + Micah's distance)
Ahito's distance = 52 miles - (8 miles + 28 miles)
Ahito's distance = 52 miles - 36 miles
Ahito's distance = 16 miles

So, Ahito ran 16 miles.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let the total number of jellyfish in the tank be \( x \).
2. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{x}{5} \).
3. A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{x}{5} = \frac{x}{15} \).
4. We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. This means \( \frac{x}{15} = 6 \).

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[
\frac{x}{15} = 6
\]

Multiply both sides by 15:

\[
x = 6 \times 15
\]

\[
x = 90
\]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

"To find the total number of students in the school, we can use the information that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. Let's denote the total number of students in the school as \( T \).

Given that 40% of \( T \) is 240 boys, we can set up the equation:

\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

Now, if the total number of students is 600 and 240 of them are boys, the number of girls can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = T - \text{Number of boys} \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

3. Multiply the round trip distance by the number of visits per month.

Step 1: One-way distance
Since it takes John 2 hours to drive to his parents' house at a speed of 70 mph, we can calculate the one-way distance using the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Step 2: Round trip distance
The round trip distance is twice the one-way distance:
\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

Step 3: Monthly distance
John visits his parents twice a month, so the total monthly distance is:
\[ \text{Monthly distance} = 280 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 560 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents is:
560"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many miles Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can calculate the total distance she will walk in 7 days by multiplying the number of miles she walks per day by the number of days:

\[ \text{Total miles Sofie will walk} = 10 \, \text{miles/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 70 \, \text{miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many miles Brian will walk:

\[ \text{Total miles Sofie will walk} = 2 \times \text{Total miles Brian will walk} \]

Substituting the total miles Sofie will walk into the equation:

\[ 70 \, \text{miles} = 2 \times \text{Total miles Brian will walk} \]

To find the total miles Brian will walk, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \text{Total miles Brian will walk} = \frac{70 \, \text{miles}}{2} = 35 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days.

"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in one 10-hour shift.
2. Determine the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in one 10-hour shift.
3. Use the information that 20 toys are still needed to find out how many toys the fifth worker produced in the 10-hour shift.
4. Calculate the hourly production rate of the fifth worker.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers in one 10-hour shift.**

- Two workers produce 6 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.
- Two workers produce 4 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.
- Combined, the first 4 workers produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.
- Over a 10-hour shift, they produce \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys.

**Step 2: Determine the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers in one 10-hour shift.**

- The manufacturer needs 400 toys and still needs 20 toys after the shift, so the workers must have produced \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys in the 10-hour shift.

**Step 3: Use the information that 20 toys are still needed to find out how many toys the fifth worker produced in the 10-hour shift.**

- The first 4 workers produced 200 toys, so the fifth worker must have produced \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys in the 10-hour shift.

**Step 4: Calculate the hourly production rate of the fifth worker.**

- The fifth worker produced 180 toys in 10 hours, so the hourly production rate is \(180 \div 10 = 18\) toys per hour.

The fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.

"To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs, we first need to calculate the weight of each of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory’s dog.

Kory’s dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah’s first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah’s second dog is half the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weights of all three dogs:
\[ \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Rob received 7 stickers from Kris.
2. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.
3. Kris received these 16 stickers from Luis, who gave him the rest of the stickers after using half of what he received from Seth.
4. Since Kris received the remaining half of what Luis had, the 16 stickers represent half of what Luis had. Therefore, Luis originally had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers.
5. Luis received these 32 stickers from Seth, who gave him half of his total stickers.
6. Therefore, the 32 stickers represent half of what Seth originally had. So, Seth originally had 32 * 2 = 64 stickers.

Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of M&M's John has.
2. Determine the total number of M&M's based on the weight.
3. Calculate how many small bags he can make with 10 M&M's in each bag.

Step 1: Total weight of M&M's
John buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces.
Total weight = 3 bags * 10 ounces/bag = 30 ounces

Step 2: Total number of M&M's
Each ounce contains 30 M&M's.
Total number of M&M's = 30 ounces * 30 M&M's/ounce = 900 M&M's

Step 3: Number of small bags
Each small bag contains 10 M&M's.
Number of small bags = 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag = 90 bags

"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth, we first need to calculate what half the Earth's circumference is. The Earth's circumference is 40,000 kilometers, so half of that is:

40,000 kilometers / 2 = 20,000 kilometers

Now, we know that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:

20,000 kilometers / 400 kilometers/day = 50 days

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth.

"To solve this problem, let's set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( V \) represent Vince's age two years ago. According to the problem, two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. Liam is currently 16 years old, so two years ago, Liam was 14 years old. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 14 = 2V \]

Now, solve for \( V \):

\[ V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, Vince was 7 years old two years ago. To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \]

Therefore, Vince is currently 9 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Eggs Painted**: 56 eggs.
2. **Arnold and Madeline**: They painted the same number of eggs. Let's call the number of eggs each of them painted \( A \).
3. **Camden and Sarah**: They painted a total of 30 eggs. Let's call the number of eggs Camden painted \( C \) and the number of eggs Sarah painted \( S \).

From the information given:
- \( C + S = 30 \)
- \( C = S + 12 \)

We can substitute \( C \) in the first equation with \( S + 12 \):
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

So, Camden painted 21 eggs and Sarah painted 9 eggs.

Next, we need to find out how many eggs Arnold and Madeline painted. Since the total number of eggs is 56 and Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs:
\[ A + A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs.

Finally, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

So, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, and then convert that weight into pounds.

1. First, we determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make with 200 crayons:
   \[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

2. Since each group goes into a box, there will be 25 boxes.

3. Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons:
   \[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

4. Then, we calculate the total weight of the boxes:
   \[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

5. Now, we add the weight of the crayons and the boxes to get the total weight:
   \[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

6. Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds, knowing that there are 16 ounces in a pound:
   \[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

"To determine how much John makes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the usable length of the tree.
2. Determine how many 4-foot logs can be made from the usable length.
3. Calculate the total number of planks from the logs.
4. Calculate the total revenue from selling the planks.

Step 1: Calculate the usable length of the tree.
- The tree is 80 feet tall, and 80% of it can be used.
- Usable length = 80 feet * 80% = 80 * 0.8 = 64 feet.

Step 2: Determine how many 4-foot logs can be made from the usable length.
- Each log is 4 feet long.
- Number of logs = 64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of planks from the logs.
- Each log yields 5 planks.
- Total planks = 16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks.

Step 4: Calculate the total revenue from selling the planks.
- Each plank is sold for $1.2.
- Total revenue = 80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96.

Therefore, John makes $96.

"To find the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns $5000 per month and this is half of what her brother earns, her brother earns:
   \[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

2. Calculate their combined salary:
   \[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

3. Determine how much their mother earns. Since their mother earns twice their combined salary:
   \[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

4. Add up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother to find the total amount of money they all have together:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time Grandma spends walking, given the different speeds and distances for the beach and the sidewalk.

First, let's find Grandma's speed on the beach. We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes. To find her speed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

For the beach:
\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

This means Grandma walks 1 mile in 20 minutes on the beach.

Next, we need to find her speed on the sidewalk. We know that she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is:

\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

This means Grandma walks 1 mile in 10 minutes on the sidewalk.

Now, we need to calculate the time it takes for her to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk:

\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:

\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60:
\[ 60 - 32 = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jane saves $4 each week, the number of additional weeks required to save $28 is:
\[ \frac{28}{4} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many marbles Bob has initially.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12 marbles, 2 dozen equals 24 marbles. Therefore, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. We can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Solving for the initial number of marbles:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} = 60 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} = 36 \]

Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, we need to subtract 10 from his initial number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug that, when mixed with the water from the first mug, results in a mixture that is at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote:
- \( T_2 \) as the temperature of the water in the second mug.
- The temperature of the mixture after combining 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of \( T_2 \)-degree water.

The formula for the temperature of the mixture is given by the weighted average of the temperatures of the two waters:

\[
T_{\text{mixture}} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{4 + 1}
\]

We know that \( T_{\text{mixture}} \) must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T_2)}{5} \geq 40
\]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):

\[
4 \times 33 = 132
\]

Now, substitute this into the inequality:

\[
\frac{132 + T_2}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[
132 + T_2 \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T_2 \):

\[
T_2 \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug is 68 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the increase in the number of cows and chickens and then add these to the initial numbers.

First, let's calculate the increase in the number of cows:
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
- Over three weeks (21 days), the total number of cows added is 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.

Next, let's calculate the increase in the number of chickens:
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.
- Over three weeks (21 days), the total number of chickens added is 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.

Now, let's add these increases to the initial numbers:
- Initial number of cows: 50
- Initial number of chickens: 20

Total number of cows after three weeks: 50 + 420 = 470 cows
Total number of chickens after three weeks: 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

Finally, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

"To find the cost per bagel after the discount, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels with the discount applied, and then divide that total cost by the total number of bagels.

1. Calculate the total cost without the discount:
   - Each pack costs $10.00.
   - Russell orders 4 packs.
   - Total cost without discount = 4 packs * $10.00/pack = $40.00.

2. Calculate the discount amount:
   - The discount is 10% of the total cost.
   - Discount amount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

3. Calculate the total cost with the discount:
   - Total cost with discount = Total cost without discount - Discount amount
   - Total cost with discount = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

4. Calculate the total number of bagels:
   - Each pack has 9 bagels.
   - Total number of bagels = 4 packs * 9 bagels/pack = 36 bagels.

5. Calculate the cost per bagel:
   - Cost per bagel = Total cost with discount / Total number of bagels
   - Cost per bagel = $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00.

The cost per bagel after the discount is applied is $1.00.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate:
- Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops.
- 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Next, we need to figure out how many potatoes are needed to make the scoops of mashed potatoes:
- It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
- 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes.
- 3 - 1 = 2 scoops.

So, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops:
- If 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, then 1 scoop requires \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes.
- For 18 scoops, the number of potatoes required is \( 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27 \) potatoes.

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus before any women alight.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 14 passengers (5 men + 9 women), 5 are men and 9 are women.

Given that the total number of passengers is 84, we can find out how many groups of 14 passengers there are on the bus:

84 passengers / 14 passengers per group = 6 groups

Since there are 6 groups and each group has 9 women, the total number of women on the bus initially is:

6 groups * 9 women per group = 54 women

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

54 women - 20 women = 34 women

So, the number of women who have remained on the bus is 34.

"To determine the total number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold and the number of sunflowers sold as part of bouquets.

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day:
- Faraday earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers at $2 each.
- The number of individual sunflowers sold per day is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \).

Next, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
- Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets at $8 each.
- The number of bouquets sold per day is \( \frac{56}{8} = 7 \).

Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, so the number of sunflowers sold as part of bouquets per day is:
- \( 7 \text{ bouquets/day} \times 12 \text{ sunflowers/bouquet} = 84 \text{ sunflowers/day} \).

Now, let's calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day:
- Total sunflowers sold per day = individual sunflowers + sunflowers in bouquets
- Total sunflowers sold per day = 13 + 84 = 97.

Finally, to find the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days:

First, let's find the total distance:
- Sid traveled 110 miles initially.
- Then, he traveled an additional 140 miles.
- Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.

Next, let's find the total time:
- The first part of the trip took 2 hours.
- The second part of the trip took 3 hours.
- Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

Now, we can calculate the average speed:
- Average speed = Total distance / Total time
- Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.

"To find the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probability of winning with the first ticket by the probability of winning with the second ticket.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.20.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning with the second ticket is 3 times 0.20, which is 0.60.

Now, we multiply the probabilities of each event happening:

0.20 (probability of the first ticket winning) * 0.60 (probability of the second ticket winning) = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.12 * 100 = 12%

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of seashells Carlos collected:**
   - Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than Carlos.
   - Therefore, Carlos collected \( 27 - 5 = 22 \) seashells.

2. **Determine the number of seashells Carrey collected:**
   - Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey.
   - Therefore, Carrey collected \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \) seashells.

3. **Calculate the total number of seashells collected:**
   - Jim collected 27 seashells.
   - Carlos collected 22 seashells.
   - Carrey collected 11 seashells.
   - The total number of seashells is \( 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \).

4. **Divide the total number of seashells equally among Carlos, Jim, and Carrey:**
   - There are 3 people, so each person gets \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) seashells.

Each person gets 20 seashells.

"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the total for the weekdays and the weekend separately and then add them together.

For the weekdays (Monday to Friday), Mason eats 4 carrots each day. There are 5 weekdays, so:
4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots

For the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), Mason eats 5 carrots each day. There are 2 days in the weekend, so:
5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots

Now, we add the total number of carrots eaten during the weekdays and the weekend:
20 carrots (weekdays) + 10 carrots (weekend) = 30 carrots

So, Mason eats 30 carrots a week.

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the duration of the second song and then add it to the duration of the first song.

The first song is 5 minutes long.

The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes is:
0.60 * 5 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is:
5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now, we add the duration of both songs to get the total time of the cassette:
5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total cassette is 13 minutes long.

"To calculate Linus's profit, we need to determine the total cost of the devices he bought and the total revenue from selling them.

1. **Cost of devices:**
   - Last Monday: 2 devices × $20/device = $40
   - Last Tuesday: 4 devices × $20/device = $80
   - Total cost = $40 + $80 = $120

2. **Revenue from selling devices:**
   - Selling price per device = 2 × $20 = $40
   - Total devices sold = 2 (Monday) + 4 (Tuesday) = 6 devices
   - Total revenue = 6 devices × $40/device = $240

3. **Profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Profit = $240 - $120 = $120

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bottles of carrot juice are required to meet 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, and then find out how many more bottles Hortex would need to produce beyond its current production capacity.

1. First, we need to find out how many bottles are required to meet 100% of one person's daily energy needs. Since one bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy needs, we can calculate the number of bottles needed for 100% as follows:
   \[ \text{Bottles per person for 100% energy} = \frac{100\%}{20\%} = 5 \text{ bottles} \]

2. Next, we calculate the total number of bottles needed for 2300 people:
   \[ \text{Total bottles needed} = 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

3. Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles are needed, we subtract the current production from the total required:
   \[ \text{Additional bottles needed} = 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Hortex would need to produce 7300 more bottles to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of octuplets dressed in each color:**
   - Carla has 8 identical octuplets.
   - 3/4 of them are dressed in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \) octuplets.
   - 1/4 of them are dressed in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \) octuplets.

2. **Determine the number of octuplets wearing bows:**
   - All 2 blue-wearers also wear bows.
   - 1/3 of the 6 purple-wearers also wear bows: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) purple-wearers.

3. **Calculate the total number of octuplets wearing bows:**
   - Total number of bow-wearers = 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4 octuplets.

4. **Determine the number of bow-wearers who are wearing purple:**
   - There are 2 purple-wearers who also wear bows.

5. **Calculate the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:**
   - The probability is the number of purple bow-wearers divided by the total number of bow-wearers, multiplied by 100 to get the percentage:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2}{4} \right) \times 100 = 50\%

"To determine how much money Abraham will earn after selling all his unused land, we need to break down the sales step by step.

1. **Initial Land and First Sale:**
   - Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
   - He sells half of it, which is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.
   - He earns $50 from this sale.

2. **Second Sale:**
   - After the first sale, he has \( 80 - 40 = 40 \) square meters left.
   - He then sells \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining land, which is \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) square meters.
   - He earns $30 from this sale.

3. **Remaining Land and Final Sale:**
   - After the second sale, he has \( 40 - 10 = 30 \) square meters left.
   - He sells the remaining 30 square meters at $3 per square meter.
   - The earnings from this sale are \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars.

4. **Total Earnings:**
   - Adding up all the earnings from the sales:
     - First sale: $50
     - Second sale: $30
     - Final sale: $90
   - Total earnings: \( 50 + 30 + 90 = 170 \) dollars.

Therefore, Abraham will be able to earn a total of $170 after selling all his unused land.

"To find out how much money John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
2. Calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.
3. Calculate the total number of collections John makes in a week.
4. Calculate the total amount of money John makes in a week.

Step 1: The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have 400 apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two, so it has:
\[ 400 \times 1.60 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Step 2: The total number of apartments John collects garbage from is:
\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

Step 3: John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, so the total number of collections in a week is:
\[ 1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections} \]

Step 4: John gets paid $0.40 per collection, so the total amount of money he makes in a week is:
\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, John makes $1248 in a week.

"To find the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

- At 5 years old, the tree produces 50 fruits.
- At 6 years old, the tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
- At 7 years old, the tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
- At 8 years old, the tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. We need to find out how many fruits a 10-year-old tree produces first.
- At 9 years old, the tree doesn't produce any fruit, so it's 0 fruits.
- At 10 years old, the tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now, we can determine the number of fruits produced at 8 years old:
- A 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits, so an 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Finally, we sum up the fruits produced each year from 5 to 10 years old:
- 5 years: 50 fruits
- 6 years: 150 fruits
- 7 years: 350 fruits
- 8 years: 800 fruits
- 9 years: 0 fruits
- 10 years: 1000 fruits

Total fruits produced = 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters. According to the problem, the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.

The combined length of the three ropes is given as 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ B = 5 \]

Now that we know the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters, we can find the length of the red rope:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Ronnie was given $5.
2. Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

Next, we know that after giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original amount.

3. Let \( x \) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
4. Rissa's remaining money is \( 15 - x \).
5. According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original amount, so:
   \[
   15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15

6. Simplify the right side:
   \[
   15 - x = 12

2. Half of the mural is yellow, so the other half is made up of red, white, and purple paint.
3. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.
4. Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint used is half of 12 pints, which is 6 pints.
5. The remaining half of the mural, which is also 6 pints, is divided equally among the red, white, and purple paints.
6. Since the red, white, and purple paints are in equal amounts, each color uses one-third of the remaining 6 pints.

So, the special size box has:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. To find out how many pods you get for $1, we divide the number of pods by the cost of the box:

"To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we first need to determine the total number of teeth the dentist works on. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. This means the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped, which is 4 + 11 = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

Therefore, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth.

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as \( W \) and Colin's current age as \( C \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   \[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   \[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, let's expand the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5C + 35}{3} \]
Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]
Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

2. Since the books are to be distributed equally among 3 schools:
   - Books per school = Total number of books / Number of schools
   - Books per school = 5400 / 3
   - Books per school = 1800

"Let's break down the sequence of events to determine how many apples Newton brought home:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up both apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other one into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall.
3. Now, there are 1 (from the first throw) + 5 (from the second throw) = 6 apples on the ground.
4. Newton picked up these 6 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree, causing another 6 apples to fall.
5. Now, there are 1 (from the previous throw) + 6 (from the last throw) = 7 apples on the ground.
6. Newton picked up all 7 apples and went home.

Now, let's count the total number of apples Newton put in his pocket:
- 1 apple from the first two that fell.
- 5 apples from the second batch that fell.
- 6 apples from the last batch that fell.

So, the total number of apples Newton put in his pocket is 1 + 5 + 6 = 12.

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices consumed by her friends and then convert that into the number of whole pizzas.

First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed:
- Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 6 slices of cheese pizza.
- Total cheese slices consumed = 6 friends * 6 slices per friend = 36 slices.

Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices:
- Number of cheese pizzas needed = 36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas.

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed:
- Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.
- Total pepperoni slices consumed = 6 friends * 4 slices per friend = 24 slices.

Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices:
- Number of pepperoni pizzas needed = 24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas.

Adding the number of cheese and pepperoni pizzas together:
- Total pizzas needed = 3 cheese pizzas + 3 pepperoni pizzas = 6 pizzas.

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 6 pizza pies.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider both the rate at which Jay makes snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

Jay makes 20 snowballs per hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this means he makes \( \frac{20}{60} = \frac{1}{3} \) of a snowball per minute.

Every 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt. This means that the melting rate is \( \frac{2}{15} \) snowballs per minute.

The net rate of snowball accumulation is the difference between the making rate and the melting rate:
\[ \text{Net rate} = \frac{1}{3} - \frac{2}{15} = \frac{5}{15} - \frac{2}{15} = \frac{3}{15} = \frac{1}{5} \text{ snowballs per minute} \]

To find out how long it will take to accumulate 60 snowballs at this net rate, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total snowballs needed}}{\text{Net rate}} = \frac{60}{\frac{1}{5}} = 60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Converting 300 minutes into hours:
\[ 300 \text{ minutes} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the year Digimon came out:**
   - Digimon had its 20th anniversary, which means it came out 20 years ago.
   - If the current year is 2023, then Digimon came out in 2023 - 20 = 2003.

2. **Determine John's age when Digimon came out:**
   - John is 28 years old now (in 2023).
   - Therefore, in 2003, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

3. **Determine Jim's age when Digimon came out:**
   - According to the problem, when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - If John was 8 years old, then Jim was 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

4. **Determine Jim's current age:**
   - Since 20 years have passed since 2003, Jim's current age is 4 + 20 = 24 years old.

So, Jim is 24 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break down the information and calculate the number of bandages used and the number of bandages they had at the end of each day.

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of bandages they started with on the first day.
   - At the end of the first day, they had \( x - 38 + 50 \) bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \( 38 - 10 = 28 \) bandages.
   - They did not order any more bandages.
   - At the end of the second day, they had \( (x - 38 + 50) - 28 \) bandages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they added \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \( 50 / 2 = 25 \) bandages.
   - At the end of the third day, they had \( ((x - 38 + 50) - 28 + 100) - 25 \) bandages.

We know that at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. So, we can set up the equation:

\[
((x - 38 + 50) - 28 + 100) - 25 = 78
\]

Simplify the equation step by step:

\[
(x + 12) - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78
\]

\[
x + 12 - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78
\]

\[
x + 59 = 78
\]

\[
x = 78 - 59
\]

\[
x = 19
\]

So, they started with 19 bandages on the first day.

"To find the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut based on the length of hair cut off and add the cost of the hair color.

1. Calculate the length of hair cut off: May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so the length cut off is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.
2. Calculate the cost of the haircut: The cost is $30 per inch, so for 2 inches, the cost is 2 * $30 = $60.
3. Add the cost of the hair color: The color costs $40.

Total cost = Cost of haircut + Cost of color = $60 + $40 = $100.

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to consider both her hourly wage and her attendance bonus.

First, we calculate her earnings from her hourly wage:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her weekly earnings from her hourly wage are:
7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * $1.5/hour = 67.5 hours/week * $1.5/hour = $101.25/week

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her monthly earnings from her hourly wage are:
$101.25/week * 4 weeks = $405

Next, we add her attendance bonus:
- Jen receives an additional $10 for complete attendance each week.
- Since she had no absences for all 4 weeks, she receives the bonus 4 times.

So, her total attendance bonus for April is:
$10/week * 4 weeks = $40

Finally, we add her earnings from her hourly wage and her attendance bonus to get her total earnings for April:
$405 + $40 = $445

- Cleaning his room: $1.50 * 1 = $1.50
- Taking the trash out: $0.75 * 2 = $1.50
- Emptying the dishwasher: $0.50 * 6 = $3.00

Now, we add up all the amounts:

$3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (cleaning room) + $1.50 (trash) + $3.00 (dishwasher) = $9.00

So, Jason earned a total of $9.00 in the two-week period.

"To find out how many pens Alain has, we need to calculate the total number of red and black pens.

First, we know that Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is:
5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens

Next, we are told that she bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens. Since she bought 5 packs of red pens, she bought:
2 * 5 packs = 10 packs of black pens

Each pack of black pens also has 5 pens, so the total number of black pens is:
10 packs * 5 pens/pack = 50 black pens

To find the total number of pens, we add the number of red pens and black pens together:
25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens

Therefore, Alain has 75 pens in total.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cost of Scotch:**
   - John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600.
   - Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:
     \[
     \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Number of Bottles of Cognac:**
   - John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch.
   - Therefore, the number of bottles of cognac is:
     \[
     2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles}
     \]

3. **Cost per Bottle of Cognac:**
   - The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch.
   - Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:
     \[
     60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Total Cost of Cognac:**
   - The total cost for 20 bottles of cognac is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
   - He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees. Therefore, he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

2. **Second Day:**
   - He planted 10 more White Oak trees, so the total number of White Oak trees planted on the second day is \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
   - He planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he did on the first day. The number of additional Lodgepole Pine trees is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \) trees. Therefore, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is \(40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

3. **Total Trees Planted:**
   - Total White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\)
   - Total Lodgepole Pine trees: \(40 + 50 = 90\)

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Fred initially made 24 gallons of root beer.
2. His children drank 4 gallons, so the remaining amount is:
   \( 24 - 4 = 20 \) gallons.
3. Barbie spilled 7 gallons, so the remaining amount is:
   \( 20 - 7 = 13 \) gallons.
4. Ronnie drank 5 gallons, so the remaining amount is:
   \( 13 - 5 = 8 \) gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, and including Fred, there are 4 people in total. The remaining 8 gallons of root beer are to be shared equally among the 4 people.

To find out how much each person gets, we divide the remaining root beer by the number of people:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ gallons}}{4 \text{ people}} = 2 \text{ gallons per person} \]

So, each person can drink 2 gallons of root beer during the party.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge as \( m \).

The problem states that ""eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" is equal to 40. This can be written as:

\[ 4m + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( m \), we need to solve for \( m \):

1. Subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
   \[ 4m + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
   \[ 4m = 32 \]

2. Divide both sides by 4:
   \[ \frac{4m}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
   \[ m = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 8.

"To determine how many eyeshadow colors Amy has left, let's break down the information:

- Amy originally had 2 eyeshadow palettes, each with 4 colors, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 colors from the palettes.
- She also had 3 makeup sets, each with 6 colors, so that's 3 * 6 = 18 colors from the makeup sets.
- Her sister steals one of the palettes, which means Amy loses 4 colors from the palettes, leaving her with 8 - 4 = 4 colors from the palettes.
- Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, so she uses 6 / 2 = 3 colors from one of the makeup sets.
- This leaves her with 6 - 3 = 3 colors from that makeup set.
- The other two makeup sets are untouched, so she still has 2 * 6 = 12 colors from those sets.

Now, let's add up all the colors Amy has left:

- 4 colors from the remaining palette
- 3 colors from the partially used makeup set
- 12 colors from the two untouched makeup sets

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is 4 + 3 + 12 = 19.

"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we first need to determine the capacity of the classes in each school.

Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students. Since John's classes each have 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

120 students / 8 = 15 students

John has two classes, so the total capacity for John's school is:

15 students/class * 2 classes = 30 students

Now, we can find the combined capacity of both schools by adding the capacity of Ali's school and John's school:

120 students (Ali's school) + 30 students (John's school) = 150 students

The combined capacity of both schools is 150 students.

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   - The jar is 6 inches by 6 inches by 15 inches.
   - Volume = 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

2. **Calculate the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans:**
   - The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume is 80% of 540 cubic inches.
   - Effective volume = 540 * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches.

3. **Calculate the total number of jelly beans:**
   - Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches.
   - Total number of jelly beans = 432 / 0.15 = 2880 jelly beans.

4. **Estimate the number of red jelly beans:**
   - Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.
   - Estimated number of red jelly beans = 2880 * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans.

5. **Determine how far off Tim's guess was:**
   - The true number of red jelly beans is 900.
   - Difference = |900 - 864| = 36.

Tim's guess was off by 36 red jelly beans.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The bus has a capacity of 200 people.
2. When it departed Chengli city, it had 20 people.
3. On the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the number of people on the bus is now:
   \[
   20 + 40 = 60
   \]
4. On the second stop, \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the 40 people who entered at the first stop entered the bus. So, the number of people entering at the second stop is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30
   \]
   Adding these 30 people to the 60 already on the bus, the total number of people on the bus is now:
   \[
   60 + 30 = 90
   \]
5. At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the number of people on the bus is now:
   \[
   90 \times 2 = 180
   \]

The bus has a capacity of 200 people, and currently, there are 180 people on the bus. The number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is:
\[
200 - 180 = 20
\]

"To determine how much Pauline spent on all her visits to the museum, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost of visits before the price increase and the cost of visits after the price increase.

1. **Cost of visits before the price increase:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - The cost of one visit is $2.
   - She visits the museum for 5 years.
   - Total cost for 5 years = 3 visits/year * $2/visit * 5 years = $30.

2. **Cost of visits after the price increase:**
   - The cost of one visit increases by 150%.
   - 150% of $2 is 1.5 * $2 = $3.
   - The new cost of one visit is $2 + $3 = $5.
   - Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year for 3 more years.
   - Total cost for 3 years = 3 visits/year * $5/visit * 3 years = $45.

3. **Total cost for all visits:**
   - Total cost = Cost before the price increase + Cost after the price increase
   - Total cost = $30 + $45 = $75.

Therefore, Pauline spent a total of $75 on all visits to the museum.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece, which is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, is:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To determine how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning he will need, we first need to figure out how many pounds of ground beef he will use to make 80 meatballs.

Given that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can calculate the number of pounds required for 80 meatballs as follows:

\[ \text{Number of pounds} = \frac{\text{Total meatballs}}{\text{Meatballs per pound}} = \frac{80}{16} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Since Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef, we can calculate the total amount of seasoning needed for 5 pounds of ground beef:

\[ \text{Total seasoning} = \text{Number of pounds} \times \text{Seasoning per pound} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of treats needed:**
   - Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats.
   - Total treats needed = 5 people * 2 treats/person = 10 treats.

2. **Set up the relationship between the number of cupcakes and brownies:**
   - Let \( c \) be the number of cupcakes.
   - According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.
   - Therefore, the number of brownies \( b \) can be expressed as:
     \[
     b = 3c - 2
     \]

3. **Set up the equation for the total number of treats:**
   - The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and the number of brownies.
   - So, we have:
     \[
     c + b = 10
     \]

4. **Substitute the expression for \( b \) into the total treats equation:**
   - Substitute \( b = 3c - 2 \) into \( c + b = 10 \):
     \[
     c + (3c - 2) = 10
     \]

5. **Solve for \( c \):**
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     4c - 2 = 10
     \]
   - Add 2 to both sides:
     \[
     4c = 12
     \]
   - Divide by 4:
     \[
     c = 3

"To calculate the total cost for Karen, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of a manicure and a pedicure with the 20% discount.
2. Calculate the cost of the nail art.
3. Add the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art.

First, let's find the combined cost of the manicure and pedicure before the discount:
- Manicure: $35
- Pedicure: $40
- Combined cost: $35 + $40 = $75

Now, apply the 20% discount:
- Discount amount: 20% of $75 = 0.20 * $75 = $15
- Discounted cost: $75 - $15 = $60

Next, calculate the cost of the nail art:
- Nail art per nail: $3
- Total nails (10 fingers): 10
- Total cost for nail art: 10 * $3 = $30

Finally, add the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art:
- Total cost: $60 + $30 = $90

Therefore, Karen would pay $90 in all.

"To find the final price of the toy after the changes in December and January, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the price in December:**
   - The original price in November was $40.
   - The price increased by 80% in December.
   - To find the increase, we calculate 80% of $40: \( 0.80 \times 40 = 32 \).
   - The new price in December is the original price plus the increase: \( 40 + 32 = 72 \).

2. **Determine the price in January:**
   - The price in December was $72.
   - The price decreased by 50% in January.
   - To find the decrease, we calculate 50% of $72: \( 0.50 \times 72 = 36 \).
   - The new price in January is the December price minus the decrease: \( 72 - 36 = 36 \).

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36.

"To find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we need to calculate the total distance he has traveled and then compare it to the total distance.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael has traveled in 3 days. Since he is traveling at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we need to know how many hours he travels in 3 days.

There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, there are:
3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance he has traveled:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours = 3600 km

Now, we have the distance Michael has traveled (3600 km) and the total distance between Alaska and Texas (6000 km). To find the percentage of the distance he has covered, we use the formula:

Percentage covered = (Distance traveled / Total distance) * 100

Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100
Percentage covered = 0.6 * 100
Percentage covered = 60%

So, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test to move on to the 7th grade, we need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly across both tests, and then see how many more she needs to reach that total.

First, let's calculate the total number of questions across both tests:
- The first test has 70 questions.
- The second test has 40 questions.
- Total questions = 70 + 40 = 110 questions.

Next, we calculate the number of questions she needs to answer correctly to pass, which is 70% of the total questions:
- 70% of 110 = 0.70 * 110 = 77 questions.

Now, we need to find out how many questions Audrey got right on the first test:
- She got 60% of the 70 questions correct.
- 60% of 70 = 0.60 * 70 = 42 questions.

To find out how many more questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she already got right from the total number of questions she needs to get right:
- Questions needed to get right on the second test = 77 - 42 = 35 questions.

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move on to the 7th grade.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which can be written as:

\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can write:

\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation, we get:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6, we find:

\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting \( S \) back into the equation for \( B \):

\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is 96.

"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using when the lights go out, we need to calculate the number of flashlights and the number of candles separately and then add them together.

1. **Flashlights:**
   - There is a flashlight for every person, and there are 4 people.
   - There are also 2 flashlights for each of the 8 rooms.
   - Total flashlights = Flashlights for people + Flashlights for rooms
   - Total flashlights = 4 (for people) + (2 * 8) (for rooms)
   - Total flashlights = 4 + 16 = 20

2. **Candles:**
   - There are 4 small candles for half the rooms and 5 medium candles for the other half.
   - Half of the 8 rooms is 4 rooms.
   - Total small candles = 4 candles/room * 4 rooms = 16 candles
   - Total medium candles = 5 candles/room * 4 rooms = 20 candles
   - Total candles = Total small candles + Total medium candles
   - Total candles = 16 + 20 = 36

3. **Total items (candles + flashlights):**
   - Total items = Total flashlights + Total candles
   - Total items = 20 + 36 = 56

"To solve this, let's break down the time it takes for John to solve each side of the Rubik's cube:

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so they each take 5 * 2 = 10 minutes.
- The fourth and fifth sides each take half as long as the first side, so they each take 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

Since solving the fifth side completes the cube, we don't need to add time for a sixth side.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Phineas Frog to travel the 200 yards back to his home, with half the distance on land and the other half in water.

First, we calculate the distance for each part of the journey:
- Half of 200 yards is 100 yards on land.
- The other half is 100 yards in water.

Next, we calculate the time it takes to travel each part of the journey:
- On land, Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute. The time to travel 100 yards on land is:
  \[
  \text{Time on land} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
  \]
- In water, Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute. The time to travel 100 yards in water is:
  \[
  \text{Time in water} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}

"To determine how long it would take John to speak 10 pages after his speed training, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate John's new speaking speed after training.
2. Determine the total number of words in 10 pages.
3. Calculate the time it takes to speak those words at the new speed.

**Step 1: Calculate the new speaking speed.**

John's original speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster.

\[ \text{New speed} = 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of words in 10 pages.**

Each page has 450 words, and there are 10 pages.

\[ \text{Total words} = 450 \, \text{words/page} \times 10 \, \text{pages} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the time it takes to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM.**

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{New speed}} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speed.

"To calculate the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to break down the information given and sum up the numbers for each day.

1. On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.
2. On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day, so:
   50 people + 20 people = 70 people
3. On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so:
   2 * 70 people = 140 people
4. For the remaining four days of the week (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th days), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Therefore, the total for these four days is:
   4 days * 60 people/day = 240 people

Now, we add up the numbers for all seven days to get the total number of people Conor saw:

50 people (1st day) + 70 people (2nd day) + 140 people (3rd day) + 240 people (4th to 7th days) = 500 people

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 500.

"To find out how many pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat, we need to calculate the number of kernels that popped in each 30-second interval and then add them up.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount pop, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
3. In the following 30 seconds, four times the initial amount pop, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so it's 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.
5. After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop, which is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Now, we add up all the kernels that popped:

20 (first 30 seconds) + 60 (second 30 seconds) + 80 (third 30 seconds) + 40 (fourth 30 seconds) + 10 (after heat) = 210

So, Garrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to eat.

"To find out how much money Frances has left, we need to calculate her total earnings from selling cupcakes and cookies, and then subtract the cost of the trays she bought.

1. Calculate the total earnings from cupcakes:
   - Frances sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each.
   - Total earnings from cupcakes = 20 cupcakes * $2/cupcake = $40

2. Calculate the total earnings from cookies:
   - Frances sells 40 cookies at $1 each.
   - Total earnings from cookies = 40 cookies * $1/cookie = $40

3. Calculate the total earnings:
   - Total earnings = Earnings from cupcakes + Earnings from cookies
   - Total earnings = $40 + $40 = $80

4. Calculate the total cost of the trays:
   - Frances buys 5 trays at $4 each.
   - Total cost of trays = 5 trays * $4/tray = $20

5. Calculate the money left after buying the trays:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Street**: The truck starts with 5 children.
2. **Second Street**: Each of the 5 children is joined by another child. This means 5 more children join, making the total:
   \[
   5 + 5 = 10 \text{ children}
   \]
3. **Third Street**: Each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more children. This means 20 more children join, making the total:
   \[
   10 + 20 = 30 \text{ children}
   \]
4. **After the Third Street**: The original 5 children give up and leave the group. So, we subtract the 5 original children from the total:
   \[
   30 - 5 = 25 \text{ children}
   \]

Therefore, the number of children now following the truck is:

"To find out how much time Charisma has spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time spent on meditation:
- Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so that's 15 minutes * 2 = 30 minutes per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she meditates for 30 minutes * 7 days = 210 minutes.
- In 4 weeks, she will meditate for 210 minutes * 4 = 840 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on yoga:
- Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour, 5 days a week. 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes.
- In one week, she practices yoga for 60 minutes * 5 days = 300 minutes.
- In 4 weeks, she will practice yoga for 300 minutes * 4 = 1200 minutes.

Now, let's add the time spent on meditation and yoga together:
- Total time spent = 840 minutes (meditation) + 1200 minutes (yoga) = 2040 minutes.

To convert the total time into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
- 2040 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 34 hours.

So, in 4 weeks, Charisma has spent 34 hours on meditation and yoga practice.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of the small sunflower's seeds:
50% of 36 seeds = 0.5 * 36 seeds = 18 seeds

So, the large sunflower has:
36 seeds + 18 seeds = 54 seeds

To find the total number of seeds in both the small and large sunflower, we add the two amounts together:
36 seeds + 54 seeds = 90 seeds

Therefore, the total number of sunflower seeds is:

"To calculate the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to consider the discounts on both the T-shirts and the shoes.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts with the buy one get one 50% off deal:
- The original price of each T-shirt is $8.
- For the first T-shirt, Jake pays the full price: $8.
- For the second T-shirt, Jake pays 50% of the original price: $8 * 0.5 = $4.

2. The total number of animals is 20.
3. The total number of legs is 70.

From this, we can write the following equations:
\[ C + K = 20 \]
\[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To solve for \( C \) and \( K \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we first need to calculate the total number of slices from the 7 pizzas. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza:

7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices

Now, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people, which is Henry and his 3 friends, making a total of 4 people:

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices/person

So, each person can have 14 slices.
