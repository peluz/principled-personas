"Let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle!

1. **The flutist lives in the second house.**
   - So, the flutist is in House 2.

2. **The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist.**
   - This means the person with tulips is in House 1 and the guitarist is in House 2, or the person with tulips is in House 2 and the guitarist is in House 3, or the person with tulips is in House 3 and the guitarist is in House 4.
   - But we know the flutist is in House 2, so the person with tulips can't be in House 2.
   - Therefore, the person with tulips must be in House 1 or House 3, and the guitarist must be in House 2 or House 4.

3. **The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.**
   - This means the person with lilies is in House 1 and the person with carnations is in House 2, or the person with lilies is in House 2 and the person with carnations is in House 3, or the person with lilies is in House 3 and the person with carnations is in House 4.
   - But we know the flutist is in House 2, so the person with lilies can't be in House 2.
   - Therefore, the person with lilies must be in House 1 or House 3, and the person with carnations must be in House 2 or House 4.

4. **There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives.**
   - The flutist is in House 2, so the pianist must be in House 4 (one house away from House 2).

Now, let's put it all together:
- The flutist is in House 2.
- The pianist is in House 4.
- The person with tulips must be in House 1 or House 3.
- The person with lilies must be in House 1 or House 3.
- The guitarist must be in House 4 (since the pianist is in House 4, the guitarist can't be in House 4).

Since the guitarist is in House 4, the person with tulips must be in House 3 (because they are directly left of the guitarist).

So, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 3.

The answer is (D) 3."
"Let's think about this step by step, like solving a puzzle!

1. **House 1:**
   - The person who likes green lives in the first house (Clue 5).
   - The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house (Clue 8).

2. **House 2:**
   - The person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live next to each other (Clue 6). Since the person who likes green is in House 1, the person who likes blue must be in House 2 or House 3. If the person who likes blue is in House 2, then the person with the gameboy must be in House 3. If the person who likes blue is in House 3, then the person with the gameboy must be in House 2. We need more clues to decide which is which.

3. **House 3:**
   - The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes (Clue 1).
   - The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover (Clue 2).
   - The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover (Clue 3).

4. **Positioning the root beer lover:**
   - The root beer lover cannot be in House 1 because the person in House 1 likes green and is eating kiwis.
   - The root beer lover cannot be in House 3 because the person who has a television and the person who only drinks water must be to the left of the root beer lover. Therefore, the root beer lover must be in House 2.

5. **Positioning the person who has a television:**
   - The person who has a television must be to the left of the root beer lover, so they must be in House 1.

6. **Positioning the person who only drinks water:**
   - The person who only drinks water must also be to the left of the root beer lover, so they must be in House 1.

7. **Positioning the person who is eating grapes:**
   - The person who is eating grapes must be to the right of the root beer lover, so they must be in House 3.

8. **Positioning the person who has a gameboy:**
   - The person who has a gameboy must be next to the person who likes blue (Clue 6). Since the person who likes blue cannot be in House 1 (it's already taken by the person who likes green), the person who likes blue must be in House 3. Therefore, the person who has a gameboy must be in House 2.

9. **Positioning the cellist:**
   - There is one house between where the cellist lives and where the person who has a gameboy lives (Clue 4). Since the person who has a gameboy is in House 2, the cellist must be in House 1 or House 3. However, the person in House 1 is already the one who likes green and is eating kiwis, so the cellist must be in House 3.

10. **Positioning the percussionist:**
    - The percussionist does not live in the second house (Clue 7). Since the cellist is in House 3, the percussionist must be in House 1.

So, the cellist lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

"Let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle!

1. **Clue 1**: The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the soccer player can't be in house 3, because there's no house to the right of house 3.

2. **Clue 2**: The swimmer and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
   - This means the swimmer and the daffodils must be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 3.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos.
   - This means the person eating mangos can't be in house 3, because there's no house to the right of house 3.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the person eating oranges can't be in house 3, because there's no house to the right of house 3.

Now, let's put these clues together:

- From Clue 1, the soccer player can only be in house 1 or 2.
- From Clue 4, the person eating oranges can only be in house 1 or 2.
- From Clue 2, the swimmer and the daffodils must be next to each other, so they can be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 3.

Let's try to place the daffodils and the swimmer:
- If the daffodils are in house 1, the swimmer must be in house 2.
- If the daffodils are in house 2, the swimmer must be in house 1 or 3.
- If the daffodils are in house 3, the swimmer must be in house 2.

From Clue 4, the daffodils must be to the right of the oranges. So, the daffodils can't be in house 1. This leaves us with two possibilities:
- Daffodils in house 2, swimmer in house 1 or 3.
- Daffodils in house 3, swimmer in house 2.

Let's check each possibility:

1. **Daffodils in house 2, swimmer in house 1**:
   - If the swimmer is in house 1, the soccer player must be in house 2 (because the soccer player is to the left of the person eating oranges).
   - But this means the daffodils and the soccer player are in the same house, which is not possible.

2. **Daffodils in house 2, swimmer in house 3**:
   - If the swimmer is in house 3, the soccer player must be in house 1 (because the soccer player is to the left of the person eating oranges).
   - The person eating oranges must be in house 1 (because the daffodils are to the right of the oranges).
   - This means the soccer player is in house 1, and the person eating oranges is in house 1, which is not possible.

3. **Daffodils in house 3, swimmer in house 2**:
   - If the swimmer is in house 2, the soccer player must be in house 1 (because the soccer player is to the left of the person eating oranges).
   - The person eating oranges must be in house 1 (because the daffodils are to the right of the oranges).
   - This means the soccer player is in house 1, and the person eating oranges is in house 1, which is not possible.

4. **Daffodils in house 3, swimmer in house 2**:
   - If the swimmer is in house 2, the soccer player must be in house 1 (because the soccer player is to the left of the person eating oranges).
   - The person eating oranges must be in house 1 (because the daffodils are to the right of the oranges).
   - This means the soccer player is in house 1, and the person eating oranges is in house 1, which is not possible.

So, the only possibility that fits all the clues is:
- Daffodils in house 3, swimmer in house 2, and the soccer player in house 1.

Therefore, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

1. **The violinist lives in the first house.**
   - So, the first house has the violinist.

2. **The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.**
   - Since the violinist is in the first house, the person with daffodils must be in the first house, and the percussionist must be in the second or third house.

3. **The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.**
   - This means the percussionist cannot be in the third house (because there's no house to the right of the third house). So, the percussionist must be in the second house, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the third house.

4. **The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.**
   - Since the percussionist is in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first house.

5. **The mystery book reader lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.**
   - The first house is the only one to the left of the second house, so the mystery book reader must be in the first house, and the science fiction book fanatic must be in the third house.

6. **The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.**
   - The history book buff cannot be in the first house (since the mystery book reader is there), and the person with tulips cannot be in the third house (since the science fiction book fanatic is there). So, the person with tulips must be in the second house, and the history book buff must be in the third house.

7. **The person who has a vase of tulips and the person who has a phone live directly next to each other.**
   - Since the person with tulips is in the second house, the person with the phone must be in the first or third house. But the third house is already the history book buff, so the person with the phone must be in the first house.

8. **There is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the history book buff lives.**
   - The history book buff is in the third house, so the person with the radio must be in the first house.

So, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house.

1. **Clue 1**: The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.

- If the person who likes green is in house 2, then the person with the gameboy must be in house 3. But this can't be true because the person with the computer would have to be in house 4, which doesn't exist.

So, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who likes green
- House 2: Person with the gameboy
- House 3: Person with the computer

   - There is one house between the person who owns horses and the person with carnations. This means if the person with horses is in House 1, the person with carnations must be in House 3. But House 1 has a cat, and House 3 has a dog, so the person with horses must be in House 2, and the person with carnations must be in House 4. However, House 4 already has daffodils, so this can't be right. Therefore, the person with horses must be in House 3, and the person with carnations must be in House 1.

5. **Lilies and Horses:**
   - The person with lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses. Since the person with horses is in House 3, the person with lilies must be in House 4.

Now, let's summarize what we have:
- **House 1:** Cat, Carnations
- **House 2:** Tulips, (not dog, not horses, not fish)
- **House 3:** Dog, Horses
- **House 4:** Daffodils, Lilies

Since House 3 has a dog and horses, and House 1 has a cat, the only pet left for House 2 is the fish. Therefore, the fish enthusiast lives in House 2.

So, the answer is:
(A) 2"

   - So, the person in House 1 has a phone.

2. **The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person in House 1 is wearing boots.

3. **The person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live directly next to each other.**
   - Since the person in House 1 has a phone, the person in House 2 must have a radio.
   - Therefore, the person in House 1 must own horses, and the person in House 2 must own a dog.

Now, let's summarize what we know:
- **House 1:**
  - Wears boots
  - Has a phone
  - Owns horses
- **House 2:**
  - Wears high heels
  - Has a radio
  - Owns a dog

So, the person who is wearing high heels lives in House 2.

- From Clue 1 and Clue 10, the person who has a computer and the person who has a phone must live in houses 1 and 2 or houses 2 and 3.
- From Clue 9, the person who is wearing loafers and the person who has a computer must live in houses 1 and 2 or houses 2 and 3.
- From Clue 6, the person who is wearing loafers cannot live in house 3, so they must live in house 1 or house 2.
- From Clue 2, the person who ate grilled cheese cannot live in house 3, so they must live in house 1 or house 2.
- From Clue 7, the person who had pizza cannot live in house 2, so they must live in house 1 or house 3.

Let's try to place the person who has a computer and the person who has a phone:
- If the person who has a computer lives in house 1, then the person who has a phone must live in house 2.
- If the person who has a computer lives in house 2, then the person who has a phone must live in house 3.

Let's try the first option:
- Person in house 1: Computer

From Clue 4, the person who is eating grapes must live in house 3 (since they live to the right of the person who is wearing boots, who must live in house 1).

From Clue 3, the person who is eating apples must live in house 3 (since they cannot live in house 1).

From Clue 5, the person who likes blue must live in house 1 (since there is one house between them and the person who has a phone, who lives in house 2).

So, the person who likes green must live in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes green lives is **(A) 2**."

4. **Tennis Player and Cat Lover:**
   - From Clue 6, the tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover.
   - This means the tennis player and the cat lover must be in adjacent houses.
   - Since the baseball player is in the second house, the tennis player and cat lover must be in the third and fourth houses (in that order).

5. **Swimmer:**
   - Since the tennis player is in the third house and the cat lover is in the fourth house, the swimmer must be in the third house.

6. **Fish Enthusiast and Dog Owner:**
   - From Clue 4, the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.

   - Therefore, the fish enthusiast must be in the fourth house.

7. **Bird Keeper:**
   - From Clue 5, the bird keeper does not live in the first house.
   - From Clue 7, the bird keeper does not live in the third house.
   - The bird keeper cannot be in the fourth house (since the fish enthusiast is there).

- From Clue 4, the swimmer must be in house 3 because the SUV is in house 3.
- From Clue 2, the baseball player and the person who likes blue must be in houses 1 and 3, with the person in house 2 in between. Since the swimmer is in house 3, the baseball player must be in house 1, and the person who likes blue must be in house 3.

5. **There is one house between where the person who likes green lives and where the person who drives a truck lives** (Clue 10). If the truck driver is in house 1, the green house must be in house 3. If the truck driver is in house 2, the green house must be in house 4 (but house 4 is white, so this is not possible).

- **House 3: Green (since the truck driver is in house 1)**
- **House 1: Truck driver, not green, not white, not blue, so it must be yellow.**

5. **The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.**
   - Since the person in House 3 is wearing loafers, the person wearing high heels must be in House 1 or House 2. But since the person in House 2 likes yellow, they can't be wearing high heels. So, the person in House 1 must be wearing high heels, and the person in House 2 or House 3 must like blue. Since the person in House 3 is wearing loafers, the person in House 2 must like blue.

6. **The person who likes yellow does not live in the first house or the third house.**
   - We already figured out that the person in House 2 likes yellow.

7. **The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.**

From Clue 10, House 5 has Grilled cheese, so it can't have any other food. From Clue 17, House 4 has Blue, so it can't have any other color. From Clue 12, House 2 has High heels, so it can't have any other shoes.

From Clue 1, House 3 has Yellow, so it can't have any other color.

From Clue 18, Boots can't be in House 3, so they must be in House 1, 2, 4, or 5. Since House 5 has Grilled cheese, it can't have Boots. So, Boots can be in House 1, 2, or 4.

From Clue 2, Running shoes must be to the right of Boots. If Boots are in House 1, Running shoes can be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. If Boots are in House 2, Running shoes can be in House 3, 4, or 5. If Boots are in House 4, Running shoes can be in House 5.

From Clue 5, White can't be in House 2. So, White can be in House 1, 3, or 4.

From Clue 13, Red can't be in House 5. So, Red can be in House 1, 2, 3, or 4.

From Clue 15, Fish enthusiast must be left of the person with a Radio. If Fish enthusiast is in House 1, Radio can be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.

The answer is (B) 4."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the first house.
   - This means the person with the lilies must live in the second house.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a television lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in the first house has a television.

Now, let's put this information together:
- The person in the first house has a television.
- The person in the second house has a bouquet of lilies.

Since there are only two houses and two people, and each person has a different device:
- The person in the first house has a television, so the person in the second house must have a computer.

Therefore, the person who has a computer lives in house number 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's think about this step by step, like solving a puzzle!

1. **Clue 1: The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the golfer.**
   - This means the science fiction book fanatic cannot live in house 2 because there's no house to the right of house 2. So, the science fiction book fanatic must live in house 1.

2. **Clue 2: The person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other.**
   - Since the houses are next to each other, one person must live in house 1 and the other in house 2. We don't know yet who ate pizza and who is the history book buff, but they are neighbors.

3. **Clue 3: The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.**
   - This means the person with the daffodils cannot live in house 2 because there's no house to the right of house 2. So, the person with the daffodils must live in house 1, and the guitarist must live in house 2.

Now, let's put it all together:
- House 1: Science fiction book fanatic, bouquet of daffodils
- House 2: Guitarist

Since the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1, and the guitarist lives in house 2, the percussionist must live in house 1.

So, the percussionist lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step, like a fun puzzle!

1. **Clue 8**: The violinist lives in the fourth house.
   - So, House 4: Violinist

2. **Clue 10**: The bird keeper lives in the fifth house.
   - So, House 5: Bird Keeper

3. **Clue 7**: The person who has a television lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
   - This means the person with the television and the person with the gameboy are in consecutive houses, with the television on the left.

4. **Clue 1**: The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.
   - This means the guitarist is to the left of the gameboy.

5. **Clue 4**: The flutist lives directly left of the person who has a television.
   - This means the flutist and the person with the television are in consecutive houses, with the flutist on the left.

6. **Clue 5**: The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
   - This means the radio is to the right of the television.

7. **Clue 6**: The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
   - This means the percussionist is to the left of the guitarist.

8. **Clue 3**: The fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other.
   - This means the fish enthusiast and the horse owner are in consecutive houses.

9. **Clue 9**: There are two houses between where the person who has a phone lives and where the person who owns horses lives.
   - This means the phone and the horse owner are separated by two houses.

10. **Clue 2**: The dog owner does not live in the second house.
    - This means the dog owner is in one of the other houses.

Now, let's put this all together:

- **House 4**: Violinist
- **House 5**: Bird Keeper

Since the bird keeper is in House 5, the gameboy and television must be in Houses 1, 2, or 3. Let's try to place them:

- If the television is in House 1, the gameboy must be in House 2.
- If the television is in House 2, the gameboy must be in House 3.
- If the television is in House 3, the gameboy must be in House 4 (but House 4 is the violinist, so this is not possible).

So, the television and gameboy must be in Houses 1 and 2 or Houses 2 and 3.

Let's try **House 1: Television** and **House 2: Gameboy**:
- **House 1**: Television
- **House 2**: Gameboy

Since the flutist is directly left of the television, the flutist must be in House 1, but we already have the television there. So, this is not possible.

Now, let's try **House 2: Television** and **House 3: Gameboy**:
- **House 2**: Television
- **House 3**: Gameboy

Since the flutist is directly left of the television, the flutist must be in House 1:
- **House 1**: Flutist
- **House 2**: Television
- **House 3**: Gameboy

Since the radio is to the right of the television, the radio must be in House 4 or 5. But House 4 is the violinist, so the radio must be in House 5:
- **House 5**: Radio

Now, we have:
- **House 1**: Flutist
- **House 2**: Television
- **House 3**: Gameboy
- **House 4**: Violinist
- **House 5**: Radio, Bird Keeper

Since the guitarist is to the right of the gameboy, the guitarist must be in House 4 or 5. But House 4 is the violinist, so the guitarist must be in House 5:
- **House 5**: Guitarist, Radio, Bird Keeper

This is not possible because House 5 already has the radio and bird keeper. So, the guitarist must be in House 4, and the percussionist must be in House 3:
- **House 3**: Percussionist, Gameboy

Now, we have:
- **House 1**: Flutist
- **House 2**: Television
- **House 3**: Percussionist, Gameboy
- **House 4**: Violinist, Guitarist
- **House 5**: Radio, Bird Keeper

Since the percussionist is in House 3, the answer is:
- **(A) 3**"

   - So, the basketball player must live in House 2.

3. **Clue 1**: The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
   - This means the person with the radio cannot be in House 1, because there is no house to the right of House 1. So, the person with the radio must be in House 2.

4. **Clue 2**: The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
   - Since the person with the radio is in House 2, the violinist must be in House 1.

So, the violinist lives in House 1.

The answer is (A) 1."

2. **Grilled cheese in the fifth house:**
   - House 5: Grilled cheese

3. **Golfer in the fourth house:**
   - House 4: Golfer

4. **One house between fried rice and spaghetti:**
   - This means if one is in House 1, the other is in House 3, or if one is in House 2, the other is in House 4, or if one is in House 3, the other is in House 5. But we already know House 3 is the tennis player and House 5 is grilled cheese, so the only possible pairs are:
     - House 1 and House 3 (not possible because House 3 is tennis player)
     - House 2 and House 4 (possible)
     - House 3 and House 5 (not possible because House 5 is grilled cheese)

   So, fried rice and spaghetti must be in House 2 and House 4.

5. **Pizza to the left of the cricketer:**
   - This means the cricketer cannot be in House 1 (because there's no house to the left of it).

6. **Stew directly left of spaghetti:**
   - If spaghetti is in House 4, then stew must be in House 3. But House 3 is the tennis player, so this is not possible.
   - Therefore, spaghetti must be in House 2, and stew must be in House 1.

   So, we have:
   - House 1: Stew
   - House 2: Spaghetti
   - House 3: Tennis player
   - House 4: Golfer
   - House 5: Grilled cheese

7. **Fried rice must be in House 4 (since it's the only house left for fried rice):**
   - House 4: Golfer, Fried rice

8. **Tennis player is to the left of the soccer player:**
   - The tennis player is in House 3, so the soccer player must be in House 4 or House 5. But House 4 is the golfer, so the soccer player must be in House 5.

   So, we have:
   - House 1: Stew
   - House 2: Spaghetti
   - House 3: Tennis player
   - House 4: Golfer, Fried rice
   - House 5: Soccer player, Grilled cheese

9. **Pizza to the left of the cricketer:**

- **First House**:
  - Person who likes white
  - Baseball player
  - Drinks water
  - Wears loafers (since the person in the second house wears running shoes)

- **Second House**:
  - Person who ate spaghetti
  - Wears running shoes
  - Must be the swimmer (since the baseball player is in the first house)

Now, let's start placing people in the houses:

- **House 1**: Cellist
- **House 4**: Not the golfer, violinist, or high heels wearer.

Since the cellist is in House 1, let's see what we can place around them:

- **House 2**: Could be the basketball player (since they need to be to the left of the person who likes red).
- **House 3**: Could be the person who likes red.
- **House 4**: Could be the person who likes yellow (since they need to be directly left of the person who likes milk).

Let's check the clues:

    - This means the person with the rose bouquet can be in House 1, 2, or 3, and the person who had pizza must be in the house directly to the left or right of them.

12. **The person who likes blue and the person who owns an SUV live directly next to each other.**

13. **The person who had pizza and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.**
    - This means the person who is eating apples can be in House 1, 2, or 3, and the person who had pizza must be in the house directly to the left or right of them.

Now, let's put it all together:

- House 1: Green
- House 4: Fried Rice

From Clue 9, the person who had pizza must be in House 2 or 3, and the person who is eating mangos must be in House 1 or 2.

From Clue 2, the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes blue. So, if the person who had pizza is in House 2, the person who likes blue must be in House 3. If the person who had pizza is in House 3, the person who likes blue must be in House 4, but House 4 is already taken by the person who ate fried rice. So, the person who had pizza must be in House 2, and the person who likes blue must be in House 3.

From Clue 11, the person who had pizza (House 2) and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other. So, the person with the rose bouquet must be in House 1 or 3. Since House 1 is already taken by the person who likes green, the person with the rose bouquet must be in House 3.

From Clue 13, the person who had pizza (House 2) and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other. So, the person who is eating apples must be in House 1 or 3. Since House 3 is already taken by the person who likes blue and has a rose bouquet, the person who is eating apples must be in House 1.

So, the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

The answer is (D) 2."

"Let's think about this step by step, like solving a puzzle!

1. **Clue 1**: The person who has a radio and the person who drives a truck live directly next to each other.
   - This means one of them lives in house 1 and the other in house 2.

2. **Clue 2**: The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.
   - Since the houses are next to each other, the person with the radio must be in house 1, and the person who had pizza must be in house 2.

3. **Clue 3**: The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
   - So, the root beer lover must live in house 2.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
   - This means the person eating grapes is in house 1, and the person with the computer is in house 2.

Now, let's put it all together:
- House 1: 
  - Has a radio (from Clue 2)
  - Eats grapes (from Clue 4)
  - Drives a truck (from Clue 1, since the person with the radio is in house 1)
  - Had stew (since the person in house 2 had pizza, from Clue 2)

- House 2:
  - Has a computer (from Clue 4)
  - Eats a banana (since the person in house 1 eats grapes)
  - Drives a minivan (since the person in house 1 drives a truck)
  - Had pizza (from Clue 2)

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step, like a fun puzzle!

1. **Tea drinker in the first house:**
   - House 1: Tea drinker

2. **Tea drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza:**
   - House 2: Pizza eater

3. **The person who likes green does not live in the first house:**
   - Green can't be in House 1

Let's put this all together:

- **House 1:**

  - Not grilled cheese
  - Not green

- **House 2:**
  - Pizza eater
  - Not milk (because milk must be to the left of spaghetti)
  - Not green (because green can't be in House 1)

- **House 3:**
  - Could be milk, water, or coffee drinker
  - Could be spaghetti eater or yellow

- **House 4:**
  - Could be milk, water, or coffee drinker
  - Could be spaghetti eater or yellow

Since the tea drinker is in House 1, and the pizza eater is in House 2, the only options left for the milk drinker are House 1 or 3. But since the milk drinker must be to the left of the spaghetti eater, and the spaghetti eater must be to the left of the water drinker, the milk drinker must be in House 3.

- **House 3:**
  - Milk drinker
  - Not pizza
  - Not tea

- **House 4:**
  - Water drinker (since water must be next to white)
  - Not milk
  - Not tea

Since the water drinker is in House 4, the white must be in House 3.

- **House 3:**
  - Milk drinker
  - White

- **House 4:**

Now, the only color left for House 4 is green.

7. **There is one house between where the person who likes red lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives.**
   - If the person who likes red lives in House 1, the SUV owner must be in House 3 (but House 3 is already the dog owner).
   - If the person who likes red lives in House 2, the SUV owner must be in House 4 (but House 4 is already the horse owner and water drinker).
   - If the person who likes red lives in House 3, the SUV owner must be in House 1 (but House 1 is already the fish enthusiast).

   - If the person who likes milk lives in House 1, the sedan owner must be in House 4 (but House 4 is already the horse owner and water drinker).
   - If the person who likes milk lives in House 2, the sedan owner must be in House 4 (but House 4 is already the horse owner and water drinker).

   - So, the person who likes milk must live in House 3, and the sedan owner must live in House 1.

9. **The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.**
   - If the minivan driver is in House 1, the person wearing sandals must be in House 2.
   - If the minivan driver is in House 2, the person wearing sandals must be in House 3 (but House 3 is already the dog owner and milk drinker).
   - If the minivan driver is in House 3, the person wearing sandals must be in House 4 (but House 4 is already the horse owner and water drinker).
   - So, the minivan driver must be in House 1, and the person wearing sandals must be in House 2.

10. **The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.**
    - So, the person wearing loafers must be in House 2, 3, or 4.
    - Since the person wearing sandals is in House 2, the person wearing loafers must be in House 3 or 4.
    - Since the person in House 3 is the dog owner and likes white, the person wearing loafers must be in House 4.

11. **The person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.**
    - The SUV owner is in House 2, and the person wearing loafers is in House 4.

- **House 3:** Dog owner, White, Coffee, Loafers
- **House 4:** Horses, Water, Minivan, ?

"Let's solve this step by step, like a puzzle!

1. **Baseball Player in House 4**: From clue 11, we know the baseball player lives in the fourth house.
2. **Loafers in House 4**: From clue 12, the person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house.
3. **Running Shoes in House 3**: From clue 4, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.
4. **Swimmer and Golfer**: From clue 16, the swimmer lives directly left of the golfer. Since the baseball player is in house 4, the golfer must be in house 5, and the swimmer must be in house 2.
5. **Milk and Water**: From clue 1, the swimmer (house 2) lives to the left of the person who likes milk. From clue 5, the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person who likes milk. This means the person who likes milk must be in house 3, and the person who drinks water must be in house 4 or 5. Since the golfer is in house 5, the person who drinks water must be in house 4.
6. **Boots and Daffodils**: From clue 6, there is one house between where the person who is wearing boots lives and where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives. Since the person in house 4 has loafers and the person in house 5 is the golfer, the person who is wearing boots must be in house 1, and the person who has daffodils must be in house 3.
7. **Lilies and Grapes**: From clue 17, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who is eating grapes. Since the person in house 3 has daffodils, the person who has lilies must be in house 2, and the person who is eating grapes must be in house 3.
8. **Kiwis and Daffodils**: From clue 18, the person who has daffodils lives to the left of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person in house 3 has daffodils, the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 4 or 5. Since the person in house 4 drinks water, the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 5.
9. **Carnations and Cricketer**: From clue 10, the person who has a carnations arrangement and the cricketer live directly next to each other. Since the person in house 4 has loafers and the person in house 5 is the golfer, the person who has carnations must be in house 1, and the cricketer must be in house 2.
10. **Tea and Tulips**: From clue 14, the person who has a vase of tulips lives to the right of the tea drinker. Since the person in house 1 has carnations, the person who has tulips must be in house 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since the person in house 2 has lilies, the person in house 3 has daffodils, and the person in house 4 has loafers, the person who has tulips must be in house 5. Therefore, the tea drinker must be in house 1.
11. **Root Beer and Coffee**: The only drinks left are root beer and coffee. Since the person in house 2 is the swimmer and the person in house 3 likes milk, the person in house 2 must be the root beer lover, and the person in house 3 must be the coffee drinker.
12. **Sandals and Coffee**: From clue 8, the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the coffee drinker is in house 3, the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 4.
13. **Oranges and Mangoes**: The only fruits left are oranges and mangoes. Since the person in house 3 is eating grapes, the person in house 1 must be eating oranges, and the person in house 5 must be eating mangoes.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle!

1. **The golfer lives directly left of the basketball player.**
   - This means the golfer can't be in house 3, because there's no house to the right of it. So, the golfer must be in house 1 or 2.
   - If the golfer is in house 1, the basketball player must be in house 2.
   - If the golfer is in house 2, the basketball player must be in house 3.

2. **The soccer player lives in the third house.**

   - So, the golfer and the basketball player must be in houses 1 and 2.

3. **The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.**
   - This means the person with lilies can't be in house 3, because there's no house to the right of it. So, the person with lilies must be in house 1 or 2.
   - If the person with lilies is in house 1, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2.
   - If the person with lilies is in house 2, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 3.

4. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese can't be in house 3, because there's no house to the right of it. So, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 1 or 2.
   - The person who ate spaghetti must be in house 2 or 3.

5. **The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.**
   - This means the person with tulips must be in house 1 or 2.

Now, let's put it all together:

- The soccer player is in house 3.
- The golfer and the basketball player are in houses 1 and 2.
- The person with lilies and the person who ate grilled cheese are in houses 1 and 2.
- The person who ate grilled cheese is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
- The person with tulips is in house 1 or 2.

From clue 1 and clue 3, we know:
- The golfer is in house 1, and the basketball player is in house 2.

From clue 2, we know:
- The person with lilies is in house 1, and the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2.

But this contradicts clue 4, which says the person who ate grilled cheese is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. So, let's try the other possibility:

- The golfer is in house 2, and the basketball player is in house 3.

But this contradicts clue 3, which says the soccer player is in house 3. So, the only possibility is:

- The golfer is in house 1, and the basketball player is in house 2.
- The person with lilies is in house 1, and the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2.

So, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 2.

   - This means if someone likes yellow in House 2, the person who had stew must be in House 1. If someone likes yellow in House 3, the person who had stew must be in House 2. If someone likes yellow in House 4, the person who had stew must be in House 3. If someone likes yellow in House 5, the person who had stew must be in House 4.

   - Since the pianist is in House 3, the percussionist must be in House 1 or 2.

9. **Clue 10**: The percussionist and the cellist live directly next to each other.
   - Since the percussionist can only be in House 1 or 2, the cellist must be in House 2 or 3. But the pianist is in House 3, so the cellist must be in House 2.

10. **Clue 11**: The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the cellist.
    - So, the percussionist must be in House 1 and the cellist in House 2.

11. **Clue 12**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
    - Since the person who likes yellow can be in House 1, 2, or 3, and the person who had pizza must be to the right, the person who likes yellow can only be in House 1 or 2. If the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who had pizza can be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. If the person who likes yellow is in House 2, the person who had pizza can be in House 3, 4, or 5.

12. **Clue 8**: There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the person who likes white lives.
    - If the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes white must be in House 4. If the person who likes yellow is in House 2, the person who likes white must be in House 5.

Since the person who likes yellow can only be in House 1 or 2, and the person who likes white must be in House 4 or 5, let's check the possibilities:

- If the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes white must be in House 4. But House 4 already has the person who ate spaghetti, so this is not possible.
- If the person who likes yellow is in House 2, the person who likes white must be in House 5. This is possible.

So, the person who likes yellow is in House 2, and the person who likes white is in House 5.

- **House 3**:
  - Drinks tea.
  - Wears high heels.

- **House 4**:
  - Only drinks water.

From clue 5, the person wearing running shoes must be to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person in house 3 drinks tea, they cannot be the one who had stew. Therefore, the person who had stew must be in house 1 or 2.

From clue 2, the person who had stew must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person in house 3 drinks tea, they cannot be the one who ate spaghetti. Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 4.

- **House 4**:
  - Only drinks water.
  - Ate spaghetti.

From clue 4, the person who only drinks water (in house 4) must be to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese. Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2.

   - Since the person with the computer (house 4) is a basketball player, the person in house 3 (cricketer) cannot be the one wearing high heels. So, the person in house 2 must be the one who likes milk, and the person in house 3 must be the one wearing high heels.

9. **Clue 2**: The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - Since the person in house 3 (cricketer) is wearing high heels, the person in house 2 (milk drinker) must have the gameboy, and the person in house 3 must have eaten grilled cheese.

10. **Clue 3**: The root beer lover does not live in the first house.

1. **The pianist lives in the first house.**
   - So, the person in House 1 is the pianist.

2. **The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.**

5. **Clue 1**: The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the science fiction book fanatic cannot live in House 4 (because there's no house to the right of House 4).

   - If the person who ate fried rice lives in House 2, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in House 4.

   - Fried rice in House 3 and fantasy book enthusiast in House 1.

7. **Clue 6**: The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
   - This means the percussionist cannot live in House 4 (because there's no house to the right of House 4).

Now, let's put it all together:

- House 2: Stew
- House 4: Pizza

If the person who ate fried rice lives in House 1, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in House 4. But House 4 is already taken by the person who had pizza, so this is not possible.

Therefore, the person who ate fried rice must live in House 3, and the fantasy book enthusiast must live in House 1.

- House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 3: Fried rice

Now, we need to place the percussionist. The percussionist must live to the right of the science fiction book fanatic, and the history book buff must live to the right of the percussionist. The only house left for the percussionist is House 2.

- House 2: Stew, Percussionist

So, the percussionist lives in House 2.

The answer is (A) 2."

4. **The person who has a gameboy lives to the right of the person who has a phone** (Clue 7).

"Let's think about this step by step, like solving a puzzle!

2. **Golfer:**
   - The golfer does not live in the second house. So, the golfer must be in either house 1 or house 3.

3. **Computer and tulips:**

4. **Radio and rose bouquet:**
   - The person with the radio lives to the right of the person with the rose bouquet. This means the person with the rose bouquet can't be in house 3, and the person with the radio can't be in house 1.

5. **Radio and television:**

Let's try to place the tennis player and the television:
- If the tennis player is in house 1, the television must be in house 2 or 3.
- If the tennis player is in house 2, the television must be in house 3.

Since the golfer can't be in house 2, the golfer must be in house 1 or 3. If the golfer is in house 1, the tennis player must be in house 2, and the television must be in house 3. But this doesn't work because the radio must be to the right of the television, and the radio can't be in house 1.

So, the golfer must be in house 3. This means the tennis player must be in house 1, and the television must be in house 2.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Tennis player
- House 2: Television
- House 3: Golfer

Next, let's place the computer and tulips:

- Since the tennis player is in house 1, the computer and tulips must be in houses 2 and 3.

Since the radio must be to the right of the television, the radio must be in house 3. This means the computer must be in house 2, and the tulips must be in house 3.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Tennis player, rose bouquet
- House 2: Computer, television
- House 3: Golfer, radio, tulips

- From clue 8, the stew eater cannot be in house 3. If the stew eater is in house 1, the water drinker is in house 2. If the stew eater is in house 2, the water drinker is in house 3. If the stew eater is in house 4, the water drinker is in house 5 (not possible).
- From clue 9, if the stew eater is in house 1, the white lover is in house 2, 3, or 4. If the stew eater is in house 2, the white lover is in house 3 or 4. If the stew eater is in house 3, the white lover is in house 4.
- From clue 10, if the pizza eater is in house 1, the apple eater is in house 2, 3, or 4. If the pizza eater is in house 2, the apple eater is in house 3 or 4. If the pizza eater is in house 3, the apple eater is in house 4.

After considering all the clues, the only arrangement that fits all the conditions is:
- House 1: Pizza, Root Beer, Red, Mango
- House 2: Tea, Milk, Yellow, Orange
- House 3: Stew, Water, Blue, Apple
- House 4: Grilled Cheese, White, Grapes

So, the person who is eating apples lives in house 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Let's solve this step by step, like a fun puzzle!

1. **Clue 7**: The person who drives a convertible lives in the first house.
   - So, House 1 has a convertible.

2. **Clue 9**: The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
   - This means the person wearing boots must be in House 2, 3, or 4.

3. **Clue 6**: The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This means the SUV and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses. Since the convertible is in House 1, the SUV can only be in House 2 or 3, and the history book buff in House 3 or 4.

4. **Clue 5**: The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the history book buff.
   - This means the history book buff cannot be in House 4 (because there's no house to the right of it). So, the history book buff must be in House 3, and the SUV must be in House 2.

5. **Clue 1**: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the person who had stew must be in House 1 or 2, and the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 3 or 4.

6. **Clue 8**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the person who ate fried rice must be in adjacent houses. Since the history book buff is in House 3, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 2, and the person who ate fried rice must be in House 3.

7. **Clue 3**: The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means the person wearing running shoes must be in House 1 or 2, and the person wearing high heels must be in House 2 or 3. Since the SUV is in House 2, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 1, and the person wearing high heels must be in House 2.

8. **Clue 4**: The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
   - This means the person wearing boots must be in House 2, 3, or 4, and the person wearing sandals must be in House 3 or 4. Since the person wearing high heels is in House 2, the person wearing boots must be in House 3 or 4, and the person wearing sandals must be in House 4.

9. **Clue 2**: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means the person who drives a truck must be in House 3, and the mystery book reader must be in House 4.

Now, let's summarize what we have:
- **House 1**: Convertible, running shoes
- **House 2**: SUV, high heels, history book buff
- **House 3**: Truck, boots, mystery book reader
- **House 4**: Sandals

We need to place the remaining items:
- **House 1**: Convertible, running shoes, pizza (since it's the only food left)
- **House 2**: SUV, high heels, history book buff, grilled cheese (since it's the only food left)
- **House 3**: Truck, boots, mystery book reader, stew (since it's the only food left)
- **House 4**: Sandals, science fiction book fanatic, fried rice (since it's the only food left)

So, the person who had pizza lives in **House 1**.

The answer is **(D) 1**."
"Let's solve this step by step, like we're putting together a puzzle!

1. **Mystery Book Reader in House 4:**
   - Clue 5 tells us the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.

2. **Saxophonist in House 4:**
   - Clue 7 tells us the saxophonist lives in the fourth house. So, the mystery book reader and the saxophonist are the same person.

3. **Percussionist and Romance Book Lover:**
   - Clue 4 says the percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the saxophonist (mystery book reader) is in house 4, the percussionist must be in house 3, and the romance book lover must be in house 5.

4. **Fantasy Book Enthusiast:**
   - Clue 1 says the romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the romance book lover is in house 5, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 1 or 2.

5. **History Book Buff and Guitarist:**
   - Clue 2 says there is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives. The only possible pairs are (1, 3) and (3, 5). But house 3 is already taken by the percussionist, so the history book buff must be in house 1 and the guitarist in house 3.

6. **Violinist:**
   - Clue 6 says the saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other. The saxophonist is in house 4, so the violinist must be in house 3 or 5. But house 3 is already taken by the guitarist, so the violinist must be in house 5.

So, the violinist lives in house 5.

The answer is (A) 5."
"Let's think about this step by step, like solving a puzzle!

1. **Television in the fourth house:**
   - House 4 has a television.

2. **Loafers in the second house:**
   - House 2 has loafers.

3. **Phone not in the second house:**
   - The person with the phone is not in House 2.

4. **Boots to the left of loafers:**
   - Since loafers are in House 2, boots must be in House 1.

5. **Two houses between radio and sandals:**
   - If the person with the radio is in House 1, the person with sandals must be in House 4.
   - If the person with the radio is in House 4, the person with sandals must be in House 1.
   - But we already know House 4 has a television, so the person with the radio must be in House 1, and the person with sandals must be in House 4.

Now, let's fill in the rest:

- **House 1:**
  - Radio
  - Boots

- **House 2:**
  - Loafers

- **House 3:**
  - (We need to figure out what's here)

- **House 4:**
  - Television
  - Sandals

Since the person with the phone is not in House 2, and we have already placed the radio, television, and sandals, the person with the phone must be in House 3.

- **House 3:**
  - Phone

Now, the only device left is the gameboy, and the only house left is House 3.

So, the person with the gameboy lives in House 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"The person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house. So, the answer is (B) 2."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
   - This means the person wearing loafers must live in the second house.

2. **Clue 2**: The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.
   - This means the mystery book reader must live in the first house.

So, we have:
- The person in the first house is the mystery book reader.
- The person in the second house is wearing loafers.

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in house number 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's think about this step by step, like solving a puzzle!

1. **Clue 1**: The person with running shoes and the person with the gameboy live next to each other.
2. **Clue 2**: The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person with sandals.
3. **Clue 3**: The person with running shoes does not live in the third house.
4. **Clue 4**: The person with tulips lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
5. **Clue 5**: The person with carnations lives somewhere to the left of the person with sandals.

9. **Clue 9**: The person with boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.
10. **Clue 10**: The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person with the radio.

Let's start by placing the person with running shoes. From Clue 3, they can't be in house 3. From Clue 6, they must be directly left of the person who had stew. So, the person with running shoes can only be in house 1 or 2.

- If the person with running shoes is in house 1, the person who had stew is in house 2.
- If the person with running shoes is in house 2, the person who had stew is in house 3.

Now, let's use Clue 4. The person with tulips lives directly left of the person who had pizza. This means the person with tulips and the person who had pizza must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

- If the person with running shoes is in house 1, the person who had stew is in house 2. This means the person with tulips must be in house 3, and the person who had pizza must be in house 4.
- If the person with running shoes is in house 2, the person who had stew is in house 3. This means the person with tulips must be in house 1, and the person who had pizza must be in house 2.

Let's check which one fits all the clues:

**Case 1: Person with running shoes in house 1, person who had stew in house 2, person with tulips in house 3, person who had pizza in house 4.**

- Clue 1: The person with running shoes (house 1) and the person with the gameboy (house 2) live next to each other. (This fits.)
- Clue 2: The person who had pizza (house 4) lives directly left of the person with sandals (house 3). (This doesn't fit.)

**Case 2: Person with running shoes in house 2, person who had stew in house 3, person with tulips in house 1, person who had pizza in house 2.**

- Clue 1: The person with running shoes (house 2) and the person with the gameboy (house 3) live next to each other. (This fits.)
- Clue 2: The person who had pizza (house 2) lives directly left of the person with sandals (house 3). (This fits.)
- Clue 3: The person with running shoes (house 2) does not live in the third house. (This fits.)
- Clue 4: The person with tulips (house 1) lives directly left of the person who had pizza (house 2). (This fits.)
- Clue 5: The person with carnations lives somewhere to the left of the person with sandals (house 3). (This fits if carnations are in house 1 or 2.)
- Clue 6: The person with running shoes (house 2) lives directly left of the person who had stew (house 3). (This fits.)
- Clue 7: The person with the television lives directly left of the person with the radio. (We need to place these.)
- Clue 8: The person with running shoes (house 2) and the person with the rose bouquet (house 3) live next to each other. (This fits.)
- Clue 9: The person with boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza (house 2). (This fits if boots are in house 1.)
- Clue 10: The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person with the radio. (We need to place these.)

From the above, the person who had pizza lives in house 2. So, the answer is:

(B) 3

But wait, we need to check the clues again. The correct answer should be:

(C) 2

So, the person who had pizza lives in house 2."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
   - This means the person with the rose bouquet must be in House 1, and the person with the lilies must be in House 2.

2. **Clue 2**: The saxophonist does not live in the first house.
   - This means the saxophonist must live in House 2.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in House 1 is eating mangos.

Now, let's put it all together:
- House 1: 
  - Has a rose bouquet (from Clue 1)
  - Eats mangos (from Clue 3)
  - Plays the piano (since the saxophonist is in House 2, from Clue 2)

- House 2:
  - Has a bouquet of lilies (from Clue 1)
  - Eats apples (since the person in House 1 is eating mangos)
  - Plays the saxophone (from Clue 2)

The answer is (B) 2."
"The coffee drinker lives in the fourth house. So, the answer is (E) 4. Let me explain how we can figure this out step by step:

1. **Clue 5**: The coffee drinker lives in the fourth house. This directly tells us the answer, but let's check the other clues to make sure everything fits together.

2. **Clue 16**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television. Since the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the person with the television must be in the fifth house.

3. **Clue 1**: The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a phone. This means the person who likes green cannot be in the fifth house (since there's no house to the right of it). The person who likes green could be in the third house, and the person with the phone in the fourth house, but we already know the fourth house is the coffee drinker. So, the person who likes green must be in the second house, and the person with the phone in the third house.

4. **Clue 2**: The person who likes green lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a convertible. Since the person who likes green is in the second house, the person who drives a convertible must be in the first house.

5. **Clue 15**: The person who has a radio lives in the first house. This matches with the person who drives a convertible.

6. **Clue 12**: The person who drives a minivan and the basketball player live directly next to each other. Since the first house is taken by the person with the radio and convertible, the minivan and basketball player must be in the second and third houses. The basketball player must be in the second house (next to the person who likes green), and the minivan in the third house.

7. **Clue 13**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the root beer lover. This means the root beer lover is in the fourth house, which is the coffee drinker. This is a bit tricky, but it fits because the coffee drinker can also like root beer.

8. **Clue 14**: The basketball player lives directly left of the person who likes red. The basketball player is in the second house, so the person who likes red is in the third house.

9. **Clue 10**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the golfer. The golfer must be in the fourth house, which is the coffee drinker. This is a bit tricky, but it fits because the coffee drinker can also be the golfer.

10. **Clue 17**: The swimmer lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. The swimmer must be in the third house, and the person who only drinks water in the fourth house. This is a bit tricky, but it fits because the coffee drinker can also be the swimmer.

11. **Clue 3**: The person who only drinks water does not live in the third house. This is consistent with the swimmer being in the third house and the person who only drinks water in the fourth house.

12. **Clue 6**: The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. The person who likes yellow must be in the first house, and the cricketer in the second house.

13. **Clue 7**: The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. The person who owns a sedan must be in the first house.

14. **Clue 8**: The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow. The person who likes milk must be in the fifth house.

15. **Clue 9**: The person who has a computer does not live in the third house. The person who has a computer must be in the fifth house.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house.
   - So, the person with the rose bouquet can only live in House 1 or House 3.

Now, let's put these clues together:

- From Clue 4, the person with the rose bouquet can only be in House 1 or House 3.
- From Clue 3, the person with the sedan must be next to the person with the rose bouquet. So, if the rose bouquet is in House 1, the sedan must be in House 2. If the rose bouquet is in House 3, the sedan must be in House 2.

Let's consider both cases:

**Case 1: Rose bouquet in House 1**
- Sedan in House 2
- From Clue 2, the SUV must be in House 1 (left of House 2), but this contradicts Clue 3 because the SUV and the rose bouquet cannot both be in House 1. So, this case is not possible.

**Case 2: Rose bouquet in House 3**
- Sedan in House 2
- From Clue 2, the SUV must be in House 2 (left of House 3), but this contradicts Clue 3 because the SUV and the sedan cannot both be in House 2. So, this case is not possible either.

We need to re-evaluate the possible positions:

- If the rose bouquet is in House 3, the sedan must be in House 2.
- From Clue 2, the SUV must be in House 1 (left of House 2).

So, the SUV is in House 1, the sedan is in House 2, and the truck must be in House 3.

Therefore, the person who drives a truck lives in House 3.

"Let's think about this step by step, like solving a puzzle!

1. **Clue 1**: The person who likes green lives in the third house.
   - So, House 3 has someone who likes green.

2. **Clue 2**: The person who likes yellow and the person who likes green live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person who likes green is in House 3, the person who likes yellow must be in House 2.

3. **Clue 3**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who had stew cannot be in House 3 (because there's no house to the right of it). So, the person who had stew must be in House 1 or House 2.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house.
   - So, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in House 1 or House 3.

5. **Clue 5**: The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the person who had stew cannot be in House 3 (because there's no house to the left of it). So, the person who had stew must be in House 1, and the romance book lover must be in House 2.

Now, let's put it all together:
- House 1: The person who had stew.
- House 2: The romance book lover.
- House 3: The person who likes green.

Since the person who likes yellow is in House 2, and the person who likes green is in House 3, the person who likes blue must be in House 1.

So, the person who likes blue lives in House 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Let's think about this step by step, like solving a puzzle!

1. **Flowers and House Numbers:**
   - The person with the carnations arrangement lives in the first house (Clue 7).

2. **Favorite Colors:**
   - The person who likes yellow lives in the third house (Clue 4).

3. **Bird Keeper and Tulips:**
   - The person with the tulips and the bird keeper live next to each other (Clue 1).

4. **Percussionist and Truck:**
   - There is one house between the percussionist and the person who drives a truck (Clue 2).

5. **Sedan and Fish Enthusiast:**
   - The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast (Clue 3).

6. **Horses and Rose Bouquet:**
   - There is one house between the person who owns horses and the person with the rose bouquet (Clue 5).

7. **Horses and Blue:**
   - The person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live next to each other (Clue 6).

8. **Cellist:**
   - The cellist does not live in the third house (Clue 8).

Now, let's put this all together:

- **House 1:**
  - Carnations (Clue 7)
  - Not yellow (Clue 4)
  - Could be blue or red

- **House 2:**
  - Could be tulips or rose
  - Could be blue or red

- **House 3:**
  - Yellow (Clue 4)
  - Could be tulips or rose

Since the person with the tulips and the bird keeper live next to each other (Clue 1), and the person with the carnations is in House 1, the person with the tulips must be in House 2, and the bird keeper must be in House 3.

- **House 1:**
  - Carnations
  - Not yellow
  - Could be blue or red

- **House 2:**
  - Tulips
  - Could be blue or red

- **House 3:**
  - Yellow
  - Bird keeper

Now, let's check the other clues:

- The person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live next to each other (Clue 6). Since the person in House 3 likes yellow, the person who likes blue must be in House 2, and the person who owns horses must be in House 1.

- **House 1:**
  - Carnations
  - Blue
  - Horses

- **House 2:**
  - Tulips
  - Blue

- **House 3:**
  - Yellow
  - Bird keeper

But we have a conflict because House 2 cannot have both blue and yellow. Let's re-evaluate:

- The person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live next to each other (Clue 6). Since the person in House 3 likes yellow, the person who likes blue must be in House 2, and the person who owns horses must be in House 3.

- **House 1:**
  - Carnations
  - Red

- **House 2:**
  - Tulips
  - Blue

- **House 3:**
  - Yellow
  - Bird keeper
  - Horses

Now, let's check the other clues:

- The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast (Clue 3). Since the person in House 3 has horses, the person in House 2 must be the fish enthusiast, and the person in House 1 must own a sedan.

- **House 1:**
  - Carnations
  - Red
  - Sedan

- **House 2:**
  - Tulips
  - Blue
  - Fish enthusiast

- **House 3:**
  - Yellow
  - Bird keeper
  - Horses

- The person who has a rose bouquet lives in House 3 (since House 1 has carnations and House 2 has tulips).

- **House 1:**
  - Carnations
  - Red
  - Sedan

- **House 2:**
  - Tulips
  - Blue
  - Fish enthusiast

- **House 3:**
  - Yellow
  - Bird keeper
  - Horses
  - Rose bouquet

- The cellist does not live in the third house (Clue 8), so the cellist must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the person in House 2 is the fish enthusiast, the cellist must be in House 1.

- **House 1:**
  - Carnations
  - Red
  - Sedan
  - Cellist

- **House 2:**
  - Tulips
  - Blue
  - Fish enthusiast

- **House 3:**
  - Yellow
  - Bird keeper
  - Horses
  - Rose bouquet

- The percussionist and the person who drives a truck are one house apart (Clue 2). Since the person in House 1 is the cellist and the person in House 3 has horses, the percussionist must be in House 2, and the person who drives a truck must be in House 1.

- **House 1:**
  - Carnations
  - Red
  - Sedan
  - Cellist
  - Truck

- **House 2:**
  - Tulips
  - Blue
  - Fish enthusiast
  - Percussionist

- **House 3:**
  - Yellow
  - Bird keeper
  - Horses
  - Rose bouquet

So, the bird keeper lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. **Fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.**
   - So, the person in House 1 likes fantasy books.

2. **The cellist lives in the first house.**
   - So, the person in House 1 is the cellist.

3. **The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.**
   - Since House 1 is to the left of House 2, the person in House 1 must like green, and the person in House 2 must like red.

Now, let's summarize what we know:
- **House 1:**
  - Fantasy book enthusiast
  - Cellist
  - Likes green

- **House 2:**
  - Must be the mystery book reader (since the fantasy book enthusiast is in House 1)
  - Must be the pianist (since the cellist is in House 1)
  - Likes red

So, the mystery book reader lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."

From these clues, we can start placing people in houses. Let's start with the most specific clues:

- **Clue 12**: The person eating grapes lives directly left of the golfer.
  - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5).

- **Clue 14**: The golfer lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
  - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5).

By combining these clues, we can start to narrow down the possibilities. Let's try to place the golfer and the person who had pizza:

- If the golfer is in house 2, the person who had pizza is in house 3.
- If the golfer is in house 3, the person who had pizza is in house 4.
- If the golfer is in house 4, the person who had pizza is in house 5.

Let's try the golfer in house 3 and the person who had pizza in house 4:

- The person eating grapes must be in house 2 (Clue 12).
- The history book buff must be in house 1 (Clue 13, since the person who ate fried rice is in house 2).
- The person who had stew must be in house 4 (Clue 10, since the history book buff is in house 1).

This setup doesn't work because the person who had stew cannot be in house 4 (Clue 2).

Let's try the golfer in house 4 and the person who had pizza in house 5:

- The person eating grapes must be in house 3 (Clue 12).
- The history book buff must be in house 2 (Clue 13, since the person who ate fried rice is in house 3).
- The person who had stew must be in house 1 (Clue 10, since the history book buff is in house 2).

This setup works. Now, let's place the other people:

- The person who ate apples must be in house 4 (Clue 17, since the science fiction book fanatic is in house 3).
- The fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 1 (Clue 9, since the person eating apples is in house 4).
- The baseball player must be in house 1 (Clue 8, since the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2).
- The swimmer must be in house 2 (Clue 7, since the mystery book reader is in house 4).

So, the swimmer lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."

   - So, the person in House 2 is the golfer.

3. **Clue 1**: There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives.
   - This means the swimmer and the science fiction book fanatic cannot live next to each other. They must have one house in between them.

Now, let's figure out where the swimmer and the science fiction book fanatic can live:

- The golfer is in House 2, so the swimmer and the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 1 and House 3, but not next to each other.
- Since the history book buff is in House 1, the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in House 1.
- Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 3.

Since the science fiction book fanatic is in House 3, the swimmer must be in House 1 (because there is one house between them).

So, the swimmer lives in House 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step, like a fun puzzle!

1. **Bird Keeper in House 3**: From clue 8, we know the bird keeper lives in the third house.

2. **Swimmer and Apples**: From clue 1, the swimmer lives directly left of the person eating apples. This means the swimmer can only be in house 1, 2, or 3, and the person eating apples must be in house 2, 3, or 4. Since the bird keeper is in house 3, the swimmer must be in house 2 and the person eating apples must be in house 3.

3. **Romance Book Lover**: From clue 2, the romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer. Since the swimmer is in house 2, the romance book lover must be in house 3 or 4. But house 3 is the bird keeper, so the romance book lover must be in house 4.

4. **Fantasy Book Enthusiast and Horses**: From clue 3, the fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who owns horses. This means the fantasy book enthusiast can only be in house 1, 2, or 3, and the person with horses must be in house 2, 3, or 4. Since the bird keeper is in house 3 and the swimmer is in house 2, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 1 and the person with horses must be in house 2.

5. **Fried Rice Not in House 4**: From clue 4, the person who ate fried rice does not live in the fourth house. So, the person who ate fried rice must be in house 1, 2, or 3. Since the bird keeper is in house 3 and the swimmer is in house 2, the person who ate fried rice must be in house 1.

6. **Cat Lover and Spaghetti**: From clue 5, the cat lover lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the cat lover can only be in house 1, 2, or 3, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 2, 3, or 4. Since the bird keeper is in house 3 and the swimmer is in house 2, the cat lover must be in house 1 and the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 2.

7. **History Book Buff and Spaghetti**: From clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in house 2, the history book buff must be in house 3 or 4. But house 3 is the bird keeper, so the history book buff must be in house 4.

8. **Banana and Soccer Player**: From clue 7, the person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the soccer player. This means the person eating a banana can only be in house 1, 2, or 3, and the soccer player must be in house 2, 3, or 4. Since the bird keeper is in house 3 and the swimmer is in house 2, the person eating a banana must be in house 1 and the soccer player must be in house 2.

9. **Science Fiction Book Fanatic and Pizza**: From clue 9, the science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who had pizza. This means the science fiction book fanatic can only be in house 1, 2, or 3, and the person who had pizza must be in house 2, 3, or 4. Since the bird keeper is in house 3 and the swimmer is in house 2, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1 and the person who had pizza must be in house 2.

10. **Grapes and Fantasy Book Enthusiast**: From clue 10, the person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 1, the person eating grapes must be in house 1.

11. **Pizza and Baseball Player**: From clue 11, the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player. Since the person who had pizza is in house 2, the baseball player must be in house 3 or 4. But house 3 is the bird keeper, so the baseball player must be in house 4.

Now, let's summarize what we have:
- House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast, cat lover, ate fried rice, eating grapes, soccer player
- House 2: Swimmer, ate spaghetti, eating apples, science fiction book fanatic, pizza eater
- House 3: Bird keeper, ate stew, eating bananas, history book buff

2. **Clue 2**: The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot be in House 2 (because there's no house to the right of House 2). So, the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 1.
   - Therefore, the person in House 2 must be the history book buff.

Now, let's put it all together:
- House 1: The person is wearing sandals, ate spaghetti, and must be the romance book lover (since the history book buff is in House 2).
- House 2: The person owns horses, is the history book buff, and must have eaten fried rice (since the person in House 1 ate spaghetti).

2. **Clue 2**: The flutist does not live in the first house.
   - This means the flutist must live in House 2.

Since the person with the lilies lives in House 2 and the flutist also lives in House 2, we can conclude that the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in House 2.

"Let's think about this step by step, like solving a puzzle!

1. **Fried Rice in House 3**: We know from clue 7 that the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house. So, we can write:
   - House 3: Fried Rice

2. **Red and Stew**: Clue 6 tells us that the person who likes red lives directly to the left of the person who had stew. This means if the person who had stew is in House 2, the person who likes red must be in House 1. If the person who had stew is in House 3, the person who likes red must be in House 2. If the person who had stew is in House 4, the person who likes red must be in House 3. If the person who had stew is in House 5, the person who likes red must be in House 4. But we know from clues 2 and 3 that the person who had stew cannot be in House 2 or House 4. So, the only possible positions are:
   - House 2: Red, House 3: Stew (but House 3 already has Fried Rice, so this is not possible)
   - House 4: Stew, House 5: Red

   Therefore, the person who had stew must be in House 4, and the person who likes red must be in House 3. But House 3 already has Fried Rice, so this is not possible. The only other option is:
   - House 1: Red, House 2: Stew

3. **Green Not in House 2**: Clue 1 tells us that the person who likes green does not live in the second house. So, green can be in House 1, 3, 4, or 5.

This means blue can be in House 1, 2, or 3, and spaghetti can be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. But since House 2 has stew, blue cannot be in House 2. So, blue can be in House 1 or 3, and spaghetti can be in House 3, 4, or 5.

5. **White and Grilled Cheese**: Clue 5 tells us that the person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white. This means white can be in House 1, 2, or 3, and grilled cheese can be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. But since House 2 has stew, white cannot be in House 2. So, white can be in House 1 or 3, and grilled cheese can be in House 3, 4, or 5.

6. **White and Yellow**: Clue 8 tells us that there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives. This means if white is in House 1, yellow must be in House 3. If white is in House 3, yellow must be in House 5. If white is in House 5, yellow must be in House 3. But since House 3 already has Fried Rice, white cannot be in House 3. So, the only possible positions are:
   - House 1: White, House 3: Yellow
   - House 5: White, House 3: Yellow

   But we already know that House 3 has Fried Rice, so the only possible position is:
   - House 1: White, House 3: Yellow

7. **Final Arrangement**:
   - House 1: White, Red
   - House 2: Stew
   - House 3: Fried Rice, Yellow
   - House 4: Stew (but this is not possible because House 2 already has Stew)

15. **Clue 15**: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover.
    - This means the romance book lover cannot be in house 5, and the fish enthusiast must be in a house with a higher number than the romance book lover.

16. **Clue 16**: The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
    - This means if the convertible is in house 1, the fish enthusiast is in house 2, or if the convertible is in house 2, the fish enthusiast is in house 3, and so on.

17. **Clue 17**: The history book buff does not live in the fifth house.
    - So, the history book buff is in houses 1, 2, 3, or 4.

18. **Clue 18**: The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fifth house.
    - So, the carnations are in houses 1, 2, 3, or 4.

19. **Clue 19**: The person who drives a minivan does not live in the fourth house.
    - So, the minivan is in houses 1, 2, 3, or 5.

20. **Clue 20**: The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet.
    - This means if the SUV is in house 1, the rose bouquet is in house 2, or if the SUV is in house 2, the rose bouquet is in house 3, and so on.

Now, let's start filling in the houses based on these clues:

- From Clue 11, the daffodils are directly left of the cat lover. So, if the daffodils are in house 1, the cat lover is in house 2, and so on.
- From Clue 16, the convertible is directly left of the fish enthusiast. So, if the convertible is in house 1, the fish enthusiast is in house 2, and so on.
- From Clue 10, the fantasy book enthusiast and the history book buff are next to each other. So, they are in houses 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 3 and 4, or 4 and 5.
- From Clue 15, the fish enthusiast is to the right of the romance book lover. So, the romance book lover cannot be in house 5, and the fish enthusiast must be in a house with a higher number than the romance book lover.
- From Clue 19, the minivan is not in house 4. So, the minivan is in houses 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let's try to place the minivan:

- If the minivan is in house 1, the SUV must be in house 2 (Clue 20), and the rose bouquet must be in house 3. But this conflicts with Clue 11 (daffodils and cat lover).
- If the minivan is in house 2, the SUV must be in house 1, and the rose bouquet must be in house 2. This is not possible.
- If the minivan is in house 3, the SUV must be in house 2, and the rose bouquet must be in house 3. This is not possible.
- If the minivan is in house 5, the SUV must be in house 4, and the rose bouquet must be in house 5. This is not possible.

So, the minivan must be in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who drives a minivan lives is **(B) 3**."
"Let's think about this step by step, like solving a puzzle!

1. **Dog Owner in House 2**: From clue 3, we know the dog owner lives in the second house.
2. **Fish Enthusiast in House 3**: From clue 6, the fish enthusiast lives in the third house.
3. **Gameboy Not in House 2**: From clue 7, the person with the gameboy does not live in the second house.
4. **Gameboy to the Left of Radio**: From clue 2, the person with the gameboy lives to the left of the person with the radio.
5. **Daffodils to the Left of Truck**: From clue 4, the person with daffodils lives to the left of the person who drives a truck.

8. **Carnations Not in House 5**: From clue 16, the person with carnations does not live in the fifth house.
9. **Tulips and Convertible Next to Each Other**: From clue 11, the person with tulips and the person who drives a convertible live next to each other.

11. **Minivan to the Right of Dog Owner**: From clue 13, the person who drives a minivan lives to the right of the dog owner.
12. **Minivan Not in House 3**: From clue 1, the person who drives a minivan does not live in the third house.

16. **Gameboy to the Right of Bird Keeper**: From clue 9, the person with the gameboy lives to the right of the bird keeper.

Now, let's start placing things:

- **House 2**: Dog owner
- **House 3**: Fish enthusiast

Since the person with the gameboy is to the left of the person with the radio and not in house 2, the gameboy must be in house 1 or 2. But it can't be in house 2, so it must be in house 1.

- **House 1**: Gameboy

Since the person with the gameboy is to the right of the bird keeper, the bird keeper must be in house 1. But the gameboy is already in house 1, so the bird keeper must be in house 1 or house 2. Since the gameboy is in house 1, the bird keeper must be in house 1.

- **House 1**: Gameboy, Bird Keeper

Since the person with the gameboy is to the left of the person with the radio, the radio must be in house 2 or 3. But house 2 is the dog owner, so the radio must be in house 3.

- **House 3**: Fish enthusiast, Radio

Since the person with the daffodils is to the left of the person who drives a truck, and the truck is directly left of the computer, the truck and computer must be in houses 3 and 4 or 4 and 5. But the fish enthusiast is in house 3, so the truck must be in house 4 and the computer in house 5.

- **House 4**: Truck
- **House 5**: Computer

Since the person with the daffodils is to the left of the person who drives a truck, the daffodils must be in house 1, 2, or 3. But the gameboy is in house 1 and the fish enthusiast is in house 3, so the daffodils must be in house 2.

- **House 2**: Dog owner, Daffodils

Since the person with the tulips and the person with carnations live next to each other, and the person with the tulips and the person who drives a convertible live next to each other, the tulips and carnations must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. But the daffodils are in house 2, so the tulips and carnations must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the gameboy is in house 1, the tulips must be in house 2 and the carnations in house 1.

- **House 1**: Gameboy, Bird Keeper, Carnations
- **House 2**: Dog owner, Daffodils, Tulips

Since the person who drives a convertible lives next to the person with tulips, the convertible must be in house 1 or 3. But the gameboy is in house 1, so the convertible must be in house 3.

- **House 3**: Fish enthusiast, Radio, Convertible

Since there are two houses between the person who drives a truck and the person who drives a convertible, the truck must be in house 4 and the convertible in house 3.

- **House 4**: Truck
- **House 5**: Computer

Since the person who drives a minivan lives to the right of the dog owner, the minivan must be in house 4 or 5. But the truck is in house 4, so the minivan must be in house 5.

- **House 5**: Computer, Minivan

Since the person with the television and the person who owns an SUV have one house between them, the television must be in house 1 or 3, and the SUV must be in house 3 or 5. But the fish enthusiast is in house 3 and the minivan is in house 5, so the television must be in house 1 and the SUV in house 3.

- **House 1**: Gameboy, Bird Keeper, Carnations, Television
- **House 2**: Dog owner, Daffodils, Tulips
- **House 3**: Fish enthusiast, Radio, Convertible, SUV
- **House 4**: Truck
- **House 5**: Computer, Minivan

So, the person with the tulips lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's think about this step by step, like solving a puzzle!

1. **Basketball player and Saxophonist in House 1:**
   - From clues 5 and 6, we know the basketball player and the saxophonist both live in House 1.

2. **Tea drinker and Cricketer:**
   - From clue 2, the tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer. Since House 1 is already taken by the basketball player and saxophonist, the tea drinker must be in House 2 and the cricketer in House 3.

3. **Pizza and Dog Owner:**
   - From clue 4, the person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the cricketer is in House 3, the dog owner must be in House 3, and the person who had pizza must be in House 2.

4. **Cat Lover and Guitarist:**
   - From clue 1, there is one house between the cat lover and the guitarist. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the cat lover and guitarist must be in Houses 1 and 2. The guitarist cannot be in House 1 because the saxophonist is there, so the guitarist must be in House 2, and the cat lover must be in House 1.

5. **Water and Fish Enthusiast:**
   - From clue 3, there is one house between the person who only drinks water and the fish enthusiast. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the person who drinks water and the fish enthusiast must be in Houses 1 and 2. The guitarist is in House 2, so the person who drinks water must be in House 1, and the fish enthusiast must be in House 2.

6. **Stew and Milk:**
   - From clue 7, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the person who likes milk must be in House 3. The person who had stew must be in House 1 or 2. Since the person who had pizza is in House 2, the person who had stew must be in House 1.

Now, let's summarize what we have:
- **House 1:**
  - Basketball player
  - Saxophonist
  - Cat lover
  - Drinks water
  - Had stew
- **House 2:**
  - Guitarist
  - Dog owner
  - Had pizza
- **House 3:**

3. **Clue 3:** The cat lover does not live in the second house.
   - This means the cat lover must be in House 1.

4. **Clue 4:** The person wearing loafers lives to the right of the person with a computer.
   - Since the person in House 2 is to the right, they must be wearing loafers. Therefore, the person in House 1 must have the computer.

Now, let's put it all together:
- **House 1:**
  - Wearing high heels
  - Likes history books
  - Has a cat
  - Has a computer
  - Must have lilies (since the person in House 2 has daffodils)

- **House 2:**
  - Wearing loafers
  - Likes romance books (since the person in House 1 likes history books)

  - Has a radio (since the person in House 1 has a computer)

"Let's solve this step by step, like a fun puzzle!

1. **History Book Buff in House 2:**
   - Clue 3 tells us the history book buff lives in the second house.

2. **Fantasy Book Enthusiast in House 4:**
   - Clue 12 tells us the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the fourth house.

3. **One House Between History Book Buff and Spaghetti:**
   - Clue 14 tells us there is one house between the history book buff (House 2) and the person who ate spaghetti. So, the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 4 (but we already know the fantasy book enthusiast is there) or House 1. Since House 4 is taken, the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 1.

4. **Percussionist to the Left of Spaghetti:**
   - Clue 11 tells us the percussionist lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in House 1, the percussionist must be in House 2 (but the history book buff is there) or House 3. So, the percussionist must be in House 3.

5. **Flutist Not in House 1:**
   - Clue 9 tells us the flutist does not live in the first house. So, the flutist must be in House 2 (but the history book buff is there), House 3 (but the percussionist is there), or House 4 (but the fantasy book enthusiast is there). This means the flutist must be in House 2, but that's not possible. So, the flutist must be in House 4.

6. **Guitarist to the Left of Tulips:**

"Let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle!

1. **Clue 1**: The pianist and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
   - This means the pianist and the kiwi eater are in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3.

2. **Clue 2**: The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
   - This means the violinist cannot be in house 3, and the flutist cannot be in house 1.

3. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
   - If the kiwi eater is in house 1, the grape eater must be in house 3.
   - If the kiwi eater is in house 3, the grape eater must be in house 1.
   - If the kiwi eater is in house 2, the grape eater must be in house 1 or 3, but this would mean the kiwi eater and the grape eater are next to each other, which doesn't fit with Clue 1.

4. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
   - If the kiwi eater is in house 1, the violinist must be in house 3.
   - If the kiwi eater is in house 3, the violinist must be in house 1.
   - If the kiwi eater is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 1 or 3, but this would mean the violinist and the kiwi eater are next to each other, which doesn't fit with Clue 1.

Let's put it all together:
- From Clue 3, the kiwi eater cannot be in house 2, so the kiwi eater must be in house 1 or 3.
- From Clue 4, if the kiwi eater is in house 1, the violinist must be in house 3. But then the flutist would have to be in house 2, which doesn't fit with Clue 1 (pianist and kiwi eater next to each other).
- Therefore, the kiwi eater must be in house 3, and the violinist must be in house 1.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Violinist
- House 3: Kiwi eater

From Clue 1, the pianist must be in house 2 (next to the kiwi eater in house 3).

So, the pianist lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the second house.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in the first house is eating kiwis.

Now, let's put this information together:
- The person in the first house is eating kiwis.
- The person in the second house is the fantasy book enthusiast.

Since the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house, they must live in the second house.

So, the number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is **2**.

The answer is (B) 2."
"The person who likes red lives in the third house. So, the answer is (D) 3. This is based on clue number 8, which directly states, ""The person who likes red lives in the third house."""
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
   - This means the root beer lover must live in the first house.

2. **Clue 2:** The pianist lives directly left of the cellist.
   - Since the houses are next to each other, the pianist must live in the first house, and the cellist must live in the second house.

Now, let's put it all together:
- The root beer lover lives in the first house.
- The pianist lives in the first house.
- The cellist lives in the second house.

So, the root beer lover lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step, like we're putting together a puzzle!

1. **Clue 7**: The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the fifth house.
   - So, House 5 has carnations.

2. **Clue 1**: The person who is wearing boots and the person who has a carnations arrangement live directly next to each other.
   - Since the carnations are in House 5, the person wearing boots must be in House 4.

3. **Clue 2**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
   - This means the person with tulips is in a house to the left of the person with loafers.

4. **Clue 6**: The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fourth house.
   - Since the person with tulips can't be in House 4, and the person with carnations is in House 5, the person with tulips must be in House 1, 2, or 3.

5. **Clue 5**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - This means the person with daffodils must be in a house to the left of the person with tulips.

6. **Clue 8**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who is wearing running shoes live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person with daffodils and the person with running shoes are in adjacent houses.

7. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the person who is wearing running shoes lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.
   - This means the person with lilies is two houses away from the person with running shoes.

Now, let's put this all together:

- **House 5**: Carnations
- **House 4**: Boots

Since the person with tulips can't be in House 4 and must be to the right of the person with daffodils, the only possible houses for tulips are House 1, 2, or 3.

- If the person with tulips is in House 1, the person with loafers must be in House 2.
- If the person with tulips is in House 2, the person with loafers must be in House 3.
- If the person with tulips is in House 3, the person with loafers must be in House 4 (but House 4 already has boots, so this is not possible).

So, the person with tulips must be in House 1 or 2.

- If the person with tulips is in House 1, the person with daffodils must be in House 2 (since they must be to the left of the person with tulips).
- If the person with tulips is in House 2, the person with daffodils must be in House 1 (but this is not possible because the person with tulips is in House 2).

So, the person with tulips must be in House 1, and the person with daffodils must be in House 2.

- **House 1**: Tulips
- **House 2**: Daffodils

Since the person with daffodils and the person with running shoes are next to each other, the person with running shoes must be in House 3.

- **House 3**: Running shoes

Now, the person with lilies must be two houses away from the person with running shoes, which means they must be in House 1 or House 5. But House 1 already has tulips and House 5 already has carnations, so the person with lilies must be in House 1.

- **House 1**: Tulips (not possible because lilies must be two houses away from running shoes)
- **House 3**: Running shoes
- **House 4**: Boots
- **House 5**: Carnations

So, the person with lilies must be in House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives is **(C) 3**."

  - Swimmer in house 2, person who likes white in house 3.
  - Swimmer in house 3, person who likes white in house 4.

- From Clue 3, the person who drinks water is to the right of the person who likes white. So, if the person who likes white is in house 2, the person who drinks water must be in house 3 or 4. If the person who likes white is in house 3, the person who drinks water must be in house 4.

- From Clue 4, the swimmer is to the left of the person who drinks water. So, if the swimmer is in house 1, the person who drinks water must be in house 2 or 3. If the swimmer is in house 2, the person who drinks water must be in house 3 or 4. If the swimmer is in house 3, the person who drinks water must be in house 4.

- From Clue 10 and Clue 3, the only possible arrangement is:
  - Swimmer in house 1, person who likes white in house 2, and person who drinks water in house 3.

- From Clue 1, the person who likes blue and the person who eats apples are two houses apart. If the person who likes blue is in house 1, the person who eats apples must be in house 4. If the person who likes blue is in house 2, the person who eats apples must be in house 4. If the person who likes blue is in house 3, the person who eats apples must be in house 1. If the person who likes blue is in house 4, the person who eats apples must be in house 1.

- From Clue 12, the person who likes blue is to the left of the tea drinker. So, if the person who likes blue is in house 1, the tea drinker must be in house 2, 3, or 4. If the person who likes blue is in house 2, the tea drinker must be in house 3 or 4. If the person who likes blue is in house 3, the tea drinker must be in house 4.

- From Clue 11, the coffee drinker is to the right of the pianist. So, if the pianist is in house 1, the coffee drinker must be in house 2, 3, or 4. If the pianist is in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 3 or 4. If the pianist is in house 3, the coffee drinker must be in house 4.

- From Clue 1, the person who likes blue and the person who eats apples are two houses apart. If the person who likes blue is in house 1, the person who eats apples must be in house 4. If the person who likes blue is in house 2, the person who eats apples must be in house 4. If the person who likes blue is in house 3, the person who eats apples must be in house 1. If the person who likes blue is in house 4, the person who eats apples must be in house 1.

- From Clue 8, the person who likes blue and the person who eats oranges are one house apart. So, if the person who likes blue is in house 1, the person who eats oranges must be in house 2 or 3. If the person who likes blue is in house 2, the person who eats oranges must be in house 1 or 3. If the person who likes blue is in house 3, the person who eats oranges must be in house 2 or 4. If the person who likes blue is in house 4, the person who eats oranges must be in house 3.

If the person who eats grapes is in house 2, the tennis player must be in house 1 or 3. If the person who eats grapes is in house 3, the tennis player must be in house 2 or 4. If the person who eats grapes is in house 4, the tennis player must be in house 3.

- From Clue 6, the percussionist and the person who likes green are one house apart. So, if the percussionist is in house 1, the person who likes green must be in house 2 or 3. If the percussionist is in house 2, the person who likes green must be in house 1 or 3. If the percussionist is in house 3, the person who likes green must be in house 2 or 4. If the percussionist is in house 4, the person who likes green must be in house 3.

"Let's think about this step by step, like solving a puzzle!

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person wearing high heels must live in either the first or second house.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means if the person wearing high heels is in the second house, the person wearing boots must be in the first house. If the person wearing high heels is in the first house, the person wearing boots must be in the third house. But we know from Clue 1 that the person wearing high heels cannot be in the third house, so the person wearing high heels must be in the second house, and the person wearing boots must be in the first house.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
   - Since the person wearing boots is in the first house, the person who had stew must be in either the second or third house.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
   - So, the person who had stew must be in the third house.

Now, let's summarize what we know:
- **First House:** Person who likes white, wearing boots.
- **Second House:** Person who likes green, wearing high heels.
- **Third House:** Person who had stew.

Since the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house (Clue 3), and the person who had stew lives in the third house, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house.

This leaves the person in the second house, who likes green and wears high heels, as the one who ate fried rice.

So, the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.

The answer is: **(A) 2**."
"Let's solve this step by step, like we're putting together a puzzle!

1. **Clue 5**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

   - Since the rose bouquet is in House 2, the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 1 or House 3.

3. **Clue 1**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - If the science fiction book fanatic is in House 1, there's no house to the left of it. So, the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 3.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 1 or House 2. But House 2 has the rose bouquet, so the fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 1.

4. **Clue 3**: The romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - The romance book lover can't be in House 1 or House 2 (since House 1 is the fantasy book enthusiast and House 2 has the rose bouquet). So, the romance book lover must be in House 3, and the person with the vase of tulips must be in House 4.

5. **Clue 2**: The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - The romance book lover is in House 3, so the person with the carnations arrangement must be in House 1 or House 2. But House 2 has the rose bouquet, so the person with the carnations arrangement must be in House 1.

Now, let's summarize what we have:
- House 1: Carnations arrangement, Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 2: Rose bouquet
- House 3: Romance book lover, Science fiction book fanatic
- House 4: Vase of tulips

We need to find out where the lilies are. Since we have:
- House 1: Carnations

- House 3: (No flowers mentioned yet)
- House 4: Tulips

The only house left for the lilies is House 3.

"Let's think about this step by step:

1. **Science Fiction Book Fanatic in House 1:**
   - The clue tells us that the science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house. So, the person in House 1 is the science fiction book fanatic.

2. **Coffee Drinker and Sandals:**
   - The coffee drinker lives to the left of the person wearing sandals. Since House 1 is to the left of House 2, the coffee drinker must be in House 1, and the person wearing sandals must be in House 2.

3. **Romance Book Lover:**
   - Since the science fiction book fanatic is in House 1, the person in House 2 must be the romance book lover.

So, the romance book lover lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. We know there are two houses, numbered 1 and 2.
2. The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
3. This means the percussionist must live in house 1, because house 1 is to the left of house 2.
4. If the percussionist lives in house 1, then the person in house 2 must have the radio.
5. Since the person in house 2 has the radio, the person in house 1 must have the phone.

So, the person who has the phone lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle!

1. **The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.**
   - So, the second house has a convertible.

2. **There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.**
   - This means if the person who likes white lives in house 1, the person with the sedan must live in house 3, or vice versa.

3. **The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.**
   - This means the person who likes yellow and the person who owns a sedan are next to each other, with the person who likes yellow on the left.

Now, let's put these clues together:

- Since the person who drives a convertible is in house 2, the person who owns the sedan cannot be in house 2.
- The person who likes yellow must be directly left of the person who owns the sedan. This means the person who likes yellow and the person who owns the sedan must be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 3.

But we know the person who drives a convertible is in house 2, so the person who owns the sedan cannot be in house 2. Therefore, the person who owns the sedan must be in house 3, and the person who likes yellow must be in house 2.

However, this doesn't fit with the clue that there is one house between the person who likes white and the person who owns the sedan. So, let's try the other possibility:

- The person who likes yellow must be in house 1, and the person who owns the sedan must be in house 2. But this also doesn't work because the person who drives a convertible is in house 2.

So, the only possibility that fits all the clues is:
- The person who likes yellow is in house 1.
- The person who owns the sedan is in house 3.
- The person who drives a convertible is in house 2.

Therefore, the person who likes yellow lives in house 1.

- **House 1:** Running shoes
- **House 2:** High heels
- **House 3:** Sedan, Truck
- **House 4:** Bird keeper
- **House 5:** Not Fish enthusiast, Not Loafers

Since House 3 has a Sedan and a Truck, the person in House 3 must be wearing high heels and driving a truck. This means the person in House 2 is wearing high heels.

- **House 1:** Running shoes
- **House 2:** High heels
- **House 3:** Sedan, Truck
- **House 4:** Bird keeper
- **House 5:** Not Fish enthusiast, Not Loafers

Since the fish enthusiast is not in House 3 or House 5, and must be to the right of the SUV, the fish enthusiast must be in House 4 or House 5. But since the bird keeper is in House 4, the fish enthusiast must be in House 5.

- **House 1:** Running shoes

- **House 1:** Running shoes
- **House 2:** High heels, SUV
- **House 3:** Sedan, Truck
- **House 4:** Bird keeper
- **House 5:** Fish enthusiast

Since the dog owner is not in House 1 or House 3, and must be to the left of the bird keeper, the dog owner must be in House 2.

- **House 1:** Running shoes
- **House 2:** High heels, SUV, Dog owner
- **House 3:** Sedan, Truck
- **House 4:** Bird keeper
- **House 5:** Fish enthusiast

Since the person in House 2 is wearing high heels, the person in House 1 must be wearing running shoes, and the person in House 4 is the bird keeper, the person in House 5 must be wearing boots.

- **House 1:** Running shoes
- **House 2:** High heels, SUV, Dog owner
- **House 3:** Sedan, Truck
- **House 4:** Bird keeper
- **House 5:** Fish enthusiast, Boots

Since the person in House 5 is wearing boots, the person in House 2 must be wearing loafers.

- **House 1:** Running shoes
- **House 2:** High heels, SUV, Dog owner, Loafers
- **House 3:** Sedan, Truck
- **House 4:** Bird keeper
- **House 5:** Fish enthusiast, Boots

Since the person in House 3 is driving a truck, the person in House 1 must be driving a minivan.

- **House 1:** Running shoes, Minivan
- **House 2:** High heels, SUV, Dog owner, Loafers

"Let's think about this step by step:

1. **Clue 3** tells us that the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.
2. **Clue 4** tells us that the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house. So, the person in the second house ate fried rice and is a fantasy book enthusiast.

Now, let's use the other clues:

3. **Clue 1** says the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate fried rice is in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first house.
4. **Clue 2** says the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the person who ate fried rice is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first house.

"Let's think about this step by step.

We know there are two houses, and each house has a person with different flowers and different pets. The clues tell us:

1. The person with the carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner.

Since there are only two houses, and the house on the left is numbered 1, and the house on the right is numbered 2, the only way for the person with the carnations to be to the left of the dog owner is if the person with the carnations lives in house 1 and the dog owner lives in house 2.

So, the person who has the carnations arrangement lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's think about this step by step:

"Let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle!

1. **Clue 1**: The person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person wearing sandals.
   - This means the person in House 1 is wearing high heels, and the person in House 2 is wearing sandals.

2. **Clue 2**: The person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live next to each other.
   - Since the person in House 2 is wearing sandals, the person in House 1 must be eating grapes.

3. **Clue 3**: The tea drinker lives to the left of the person who has a television.
   - This means the person in House 1 drinks tea, and the person in House 2 has a television.

Now, let's put it all together:
- **House 1**: 
  - Wearing high heels
  - Eating grapes
  - Drinking tea
  - Has a phone (since the other person has a television)
- **House 2**: 
  - Wearing sandals
  - Eating kiwis (since the other person is eating grapes)
  - Drinking water (since the other person drinks tea)
  - Has a television

So, the person who is eating kiwis lives in House 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle!

1. **Clue 3**: The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - So, the person in House 1 drinks tea.

2. **Clue 4**: The violinist does not live in the third house.
   - This means the violinist can only live in House 1 or House 2.

3. **Clue 2**: There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - If the violinist lives in House 1, the guitarist must live in House 3 (because there is one house between them, which is House 2).
   - If the violinist lives in House 2, the guitarist must live in House 1 (but we already know the tea drinker lives in House 1, so this can't be true).

So, the violinist must live in House 1, and the guitarist must live in House 3.

4. **Clue 1**: The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.
   - Since the violinist lives in House 1, the cellist must live in either House 2 or House 3.
   - If the cellist lives in House 2, the person who drinks water must live in House 3 (because House 3 is to the right of House 2).

So, the cellist lives in House 2, and the person who drinks water lives in House 3.

5. **Final Check**:
   - House 1: Tea drinker (violinist)
   - House 2: Cellist
   - House 3: Water drinker (guitarist)

Therefore, the guitarist lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's solve this step by step, like we're putting together a puzzle!

1. **Sandals in the third house:**
   - House 3: Sandals

2. **Running shoes not in the first house:**
   - House 1: Not running shoes

3. **Sandals live directly left of the person who only drinks water:**
   - House 3: Sandals
   - House 4: Water

4. **Tea drinker in the fifth house:**
   - House 5: Tea

5. **One house between the coffee drinker and the person wearing loafers:**
   - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 3), (House 2, House 4), (House 3, House 5)
   - But House 3 has sandals, and House 4 has water, so the only possible pair is (House 2, House 4) or (House 1, House 3).

6. **Water drinker (House 4) is to the left of the person wearing boots:**
   - House 4: Water
   - House 5: Tea
   - House 5 can't have boots, so boots must be in House 1 or House 2.

7. **Milk drinker in the third house:**
   - House 3: Sandals, Milk

Now, let's put it all together:
- House 1: Not running shoes, not sandals, not milk, not water, not tea
- House 2: Not sandals, not milk, not water, not tea
- House 3: Sandals, Milk
- House 4: Water
- House 5: Tea

From clue 5, the only possible pair left is (House 2, House 4) for the coffee drinker and the person wearing loafers. Since House 4 has water, House 2 must be the coffee drinker, and House 4 must have loafers.

- House 2: Coffee, Loafers
- House 4: Water, Loafers (but we already know it's water, so this is a mistake in the initial assumption. Let's correct it: House 4: Water, not loafers)

Since House 4 has water, and there is one house between the coffee drinker and the person wearing loafers, the only possible pair is (House 1, House 3). But House 3 has sandals, so House 1 must be the coffee drinker, and House 3 must have loafers.

- House 1: Coffee, Not running shoes, Not sandals, Not milk, Not water, Not tea
- House 2: Not sandals, Not milk, Not water, Not tea
- House 3: Sandals, Milk, Loafers
- House 4: Water
- House 5: Tea

Now, the only shoes left for House 1 are running shoes or boots. Since running shoes are not in House 1, House 1 must have boots.

- House 1: Coffee, Boots
- House 2: Not sandals, Not milk, Not water, Not tea, Not boots
- House 3: Sandals, Milk, Loafers
- House 4: Water
- House 5: Tea

The only shoes left for House 2 are high heels.

- House 1: Coffee, Boots
- House 2: High Heels
- House 3: Sandals, Milk, Loafers
- House 4: Water
- House 5: Tea

So, the person who only drinks water lives in House 4.

   - So, the computer is not in House 4.

4. **Clue 5**: The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means if someone ate grilled cheese in House 1, then spaghetti is in House 2. If grilled cheese is in House 2, then spaghetti is in House 3, and so on.

5. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who ate grilled cheese lives and where the person who has a radio lives.
   - If grilled cheese is in House 1, then the radio is in House 3.
   - If grilled cheese is in House 2, then the radio is in House 4 (but we know the radio is not in House 4).
   - If grilled cheese is in House 3, then the radio is in House 5.
   - If grilled cheese is in House 4, then the radio is in House 6 (but there is no House 6).

   So, the only possible positions are:
   - Grilled cheese in House 1, radio in House 3.
   - Grilled cheese in House 3, radio in House 5.

6. **Clue 1**: The person who has a gameboy and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
   - They must be in Houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4, or 4 and 5.

7. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the person who has a gameboy lives and where the person who ate fried rice lives.
   - If the gameboy is in House 1, then fried rice is in House 3.
   - If the gameboy is in House 2, then fried rice is in House 4 (but House 4 has pizza).
   - If the gameboy is in House 3, then fried rice is in House 5.
   - If the gameboy is in House 4, then fried rice is in House 6 (but there is no House 6).

   So, the only possible positions are:
   - Gameboy in House 1, fried rice in House 3.
   - Gameboy in House 3, fried rice in House 5.

8. **Combining Clues 3 and 4**:
   - If grilled cheese is in House 1, then the radio is in House 3, and the gameboy is in House 1, which means fried rice is in House 3. This is not possible because House 3 cannot have both the radio and fried rice.
   - If grilled cheese is in House 3, then the radio is in House 5, and the gameboy is in House 3, which means fried rice is in House 5. This is not possible because House 5 cannot have both the radio and fried rice.

   So, the only possible positions are:
   - Grilled cheese in House 1, radio in House 3, gameboy in House 2, and fried rice in House 4 (but House 4 has pizza, so this is not possible).
   - Grilled cheese in House 3, radio in House 5, gameboy in House 1, and fried rice in House 3 (but House 3 cannot have both grilled cheese and fried rice).

   The only possible solution is:
   - Grilled cheese in House 1, radio in House 3, gameboy in House 2, and fried rice in House 4 (but House 4 has pizza, so this is not possible).

9. **Revisiting Clue 5**:
   - If grilled cheese is in House 1, then spaghetti is in House 2.

10. **Final Check**:
    - House 1: Grilled cheese, gameboy
    - House 2: Spaghetti, computer
    - House 3: Radio
    - House 4: Pizza, phone
    - House 5: Fried rice, television

So, the person who ate spaghetti lives in House 2.

2. **Clue 2**: The percussionist does not live in the second house.
   - This means the percussionist must live in the first house.

Since the bird keeper and the percussionist both live in the first house, the person in the first house must be the bird keeper and the percussionist.

Now, let's figure out what the person in the first house ate for lunch:

- **House 1**: Could be white or yellow.
- **House 2**: Grapes (already known).

Since the person who likes green and the person who likes red must be next to each other, and the person who likes green must be to the left of the person who likes yellow, the only possible arrangement is:

- **House 1**: White
- **House 2**: Grapes
- **House 3**: Green

  - Wearing loafers (Clue 1)
  - Can't be wearing boots (Clue 4, because boots can't be in House 3)
  - Can't be wearing running shoes (since it's the only shoe left for House 3)

- **House 2:**
  - Can't be wearing loafers (House 1 is wearing loafers)
  - Can't be wearing boots (Clue 6, because boots must be to the right of the gameboy)
  - Therefore, the person in House 2 must be wearing **running shoes** (since it's the only shoe left).

- **House 3:**
  - Can't be wearing loafers (House 1 is wearing loafers)
  - Can't be wearing running shoes (House 2 is wearing running shoes)

   - This means the fish enthusiast cannot live in House 3, and the person who owns horses cannot live in House 1.

3. **Clue 3**: The golfer and the baseball player live directly next to each other.
   - Since the golfer can only be in House 1 or House 2, the baseball player must be in the house next to the golfer. So, if the golfer is in House 1, the baseball player is in House 2, and if the golfer is in House 2, the baseball player is in House 1.

Now, let's put it all together:
- **House 1:** The person is eating oranges.
- **House 2:** The person is eating mangos.
- **House 3:** The person owns horses and drives a convertible.

Since the person driving the truck lives directly left of the person driving the convertible, the truck driver must be in House 2.

- **House 1 or 2: Gameboy**
- **House 4 or 5: Phone**
- **House 1 or 2: Computer**

"Let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle!

1. **Mango Eater in House 1:**
   - The person eating mangos lives in the first house. So, House 1 has mangos.

- **House 1:** Mango eater (from Clue 1)
- **House 2:** Not the horse owner (from Clue 5)
- **House 3:** Not the banana eater (from Clue 4)
- **House 4:** 

Since the bird keeper and the kiwi eater are next to each other, and the mango eater is in House 1, the bird keeper and the kiwi eater must be in Houses 2 and 3 or Houses 3 and 4.

- If the bird keeper is in House 2, the kiwi eater must be in House 3.
- If the bird keeper is in House 3, the kiwi eater must be in House 2.

But we also know the banana eater is not in House 3, and the banana eater is directly to the left of the dog owner. This means the banana eater and the dog owner must be in Houses 2 and 3 or Houses 3 and 4.

Let's try both possibilities:

1. **If the bird keeper is in House 2:**
   - Kiwi eater is in House 3.
   - Banana eater is in House 1 (but House 1 already has the mango eater, so this is not possible).

2. **If the bird keeper is in House 3:**
   - Kiwi eater is in House 2.
   - Banana eater is in House 2 (but House 2 already has the kiwi eater, so this is not possible).

So, the only possibility that fits all the clues is:

- **House 2:** Kiwi eater
- **House 3:** Bird keeper
- **House 4:** Banana eater (and the dog owner is in House 4)

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in House 3.

The answer is: **(D) 3**."
"Let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a puzzle!

1. **Mystery Book Reader in House 1:**
   - The clue tells us that the mystery book reader lives in the first house. So, House 1 is the mystery book reader's home.

2. **Romance Book Lover Not in House 3:**
   - The romance book lover does not live in the third house. So, the romance book lover must live in either House 1 or House 2.

3. **Horse Owner Not in House 3:**
   - The person who owns horses does not live in the third house. So, the horse owner must live in either House 1 or House 2.

4. **Bird Keeper and History Book Buff:**
   - The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the bird keeper must be in House 1 or House 2, and the history book buff must be in House 2 or House 3.

Now, let's put it all together:

- **House 1:**
  - The mystery book reader lives here.
  - The bird keeper cannot live here because the bird keeper must be directly left of the history book buff, and there is no house to the left of House 1.
  - Therefore, the horse owner must live in House 1.

- **House 2:**
  - The bird keeper must live here because the bird keeper is directly left of the history book buff.
  - The history book buff must live in House 3 because the bird keeper is in House 2.

- **House 3:**
  - The history book buff lives here.
  - The romance book lover cannot live here because the romance book lover does not live in the third house.

So, the romance book lover must live in **House 2**.

The answer is (B) 2."

   - Since the person with the rose bouquet is in the first house, the golfer must be in the third house.

5. **Clue 2**: There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the golfer lives.
   - The golfer is in the third house, so the person with the daffodils must be in the first house.

6. **Clue 1**: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - The person with the daffodils is in the first house, so the person who had stew must be in the second or third house. Since the golfer is in the third house, the person who had stew must be in the second house.

7. **Clue 5**: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
   - The person who had stew is in the second house, so the history book buff must be in the third house.

8. **Clue 7**: The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - The person who had stew is in the second house, so the person wearing running shoes must be in the third house.

Now, let's summarize what we know:
- **First House**: Daffodils, Rose bouquet (but not both), not stew, not soccer player, not golfer.
- **Second House**: Spaghetti, soccer player, stew.
- **Third House**: Golfer, history book buff, running shoes.

Since the first house has the daffodils and the second house has the spaghetti, the only flower left for the third house is the carnations.

So, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the **third house**.

   - So, House 2 has lilies.

2. **Clue 2**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot be in House 1 because there is no house to the left of it. So, the coffee drinker must be in House 2 or House 3.
   - If the coffee drinker is in House 2, then the person with the rose bouquet must be in House 1.
   - If the coffee drinker is in House 3, then the person with the rose bouquet must be in House 2. But House 2 already has lilies, so this can't be true.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - Since the coffee drinker is in House 2, the person who owns an SUV must be in House 1.

   - The person who drives a truck cannot be in House 1 because House 1 is the leftmost house.
   - The person who drives a truck also cannot be in House 2 because House 2 already has the coffee drinker.
   - Therefore, the person who drives a truck must be in House 3.
   - This means the person who drives a minivan must be in House 1 or House 2. But House 2 already has the coffee drinker, so the person who drives a minivan must be in House 1.

5. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.

   - The root beer lover cannot be in House 3 because the truck driver is there.

So, we have:
- House 1: Rose bouquet, SUV, root beer lover
- House 2: Lilies, coffee drinker
- House 3: Truck, (we don't know the drink yet, but it must be tea because root beer and coffee are already taken)

The coffee drinker lives in House 2.

"Let's think about this step by step:

1. The pianist lives in the second house.
2. The person with the bouquet of daffodils and the pianist live next to each other.

Since the pianist is in the second house, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in the first house because they are next to each other.

So, the person with the bouquet of daffodils lives in house number 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step, like a fun puzzle!

1. **Oranges in the first house:**
   - House 1: Oranges

2. **Banana in the fourth house:**
   - House 4: Banana

3. **SUV in the fourth house:**
   - House 4: Banana, SUV

4. **Apples directly left of daffodils:**
   - Since the fourth house is taken by the banana, the only place for apples to be directly left of daffodils is:
   - House 3: Apples
   - House 4: Banana, SUV, Daffodils

5. **Daffodils directly left of minivan:**
   - House 4: Banana, SUV, Daffodils
   - House 5: Minivan

6. **Tulips to the left of convertible:**
   - Tulips can't be in House 4 or 5, so it must be in House 1, 2, or 3.
   - Convertible must be in House 2, 3, or 5.
   - Since House 3 has apples, tulips can't be there. So, tulips must be in House 1 or 2.
   - If tulips are in House 1, convertible must be in House 2 or 3. But House 3 has apples, so convertible must be in House 2.
   - If tulips are in House 2, convertible must be in House 3 or 5. But House 3 has apples, so convertible must be in House 5.
   - Since House 5 already has a minivan, tulips must be in House 1 and convertible in House 2.
   - House 1: Oranges, Tulips
   - House 2: Convertible

7. **Carnations and lilies:**
   - There is one house between carnations and lilies.
   - Carnations can't be in House 1, 2, 4, or 5 (already taken).
   - So, carnations must be in House 3.
   - Lilies must be in House 5.
   - House 3: Apples, Carnations
   - House 5: Minivan, Lilies

8. **Sedan to the right of carnations:**
   - Sedan must be in House 4 or 5.
   - House 4 already has an SUV, so sedan must be in House 5.
   - But House 5 already has a minivan, so this is a contradiction. Let's recheck:
   - Sedan must be in House 3.
   - House 3: Apples, Carnations, Sedan

9. **Grapes not in the fifth house:**
   - Grapes must be in House 2 or 3.
   - House 3 already has apples, so grapes must be in House 2.
   - House 2: Grapes, Convertible

10. **Mango:**
    - Mango must be in House 5.
    - House 5: Mango, Minivan, Lilies

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Oranges, Tulips
- House 2: Grapes, Convertible
- House 3: Apples, Carnations, Sedan
- House 4: Banana, SUV, Daffodils
- House 5: Mango, Minivan, Lilies

The person who owns a sedan lives in House 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Let's think about this step by step, like solving a puzzle!

1. **Clue 1**: The person who likes blue lives directly left of the root beer lover.
   - This means the person who likes blue is in House 1, and the root beer lover is in House 2.

2. **Clue 2**: The romance book lover does not live in the first house.
   - So, the romance book lover must live in House 2.

3. **Clue 3**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - Since the root beer lover is in House 2, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in House 1.

4. **Clue 4**: The soccer player lives in the second house.
   - So, the soccer player is in House 2.

Now, let's put it all together:
- House 1: 
  - Likes blue
  - Ate grilled cheese
  - (We don't know the book type or drink yet)
- House 2:
  - Root beer lover
  - Romance book lover
  - Soccer player
  - (We don't know the favorite color yet)

Since the root beer lover is in House 2, the answer is:

(B) 2"
"Let's think about this step by step, like solving a puzzle!

1. **Soccer Player's House:**
   - The soccer player is not in the first or fourth house (Clues 1 and 4).
   - So, the soccer player could be in the second, third, or fifth house.

2. **Cricketer's House:**
   - The cricketer is to the right of the soccer player (Clue 2).
   - If the soccer player is in the second house, the cricketer could be in the third, fourth, or fifth house.
   - If the soccer player is in the third house, the cricketer could be in the fourth or fifth house.
   - If the soccer player is in the fifth house, the cricketer cannot be to the right (so this is not possible).

3. **Yellow and Daffodils:**
   - The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person with daffodils (Clue 6).
   - The person with daffodils is in the second house (Clue 8).
   - So, the person who likes yellow is in the first house.

4. **Red and Lilies:**
   - The person who likes red lives directly left of the person with lilies (Clue 7).
   - The person with lilies must be in the third, fourth, or fifth house (since the person who likes red must be to the left of them).

5. **White:**
   - The person who likes white does not live in the second house (Clue 10).
   - The person who likes white could be in the first, third, fourth, or fifth house.

6. **Tulips and Baseball Player:**
   - The person with tulips and the baseball player live next to each other (Clue 9).
   - The person with tulips could be in the first, second, third, or fourth house (since they must be next to the baseball player).

7. **Carnations:**
   - The person with carnations lives to the right of the person with tulips (Clue 11).
   - The person with carnations could be in the third, fourth, or fifth house.

8. **Rose and White:**
   - The person with a rose bouquet lives to the right of the person who likes white (Clue 12).
   - The person with a rose bouquet could be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth house.

Now, let's put it all together:

- **First House:**
  - Person who likes yellow.
  - Cannot have daffodils (Clue 8).
  - Could have tulips, lilies, carnations, or roses.
  - Could be the swimmer, baseball player, or soccer player (since the cricketer is to the right of the soccer player).

- **Second House:**
  - Person with daffodils.
  - Could be the swimmer, baseball player, or soccer player.

- **Third House:**
  - Person with lilies (since the person who likes red is directly left of them).
  - Could be the swimmer, baseball player, or cricketer.

- **Fourth House:**
  - Not the soccer player (Clue 1).
  - Could be the swimmer, baseball player, or cricketer.

- **Fifth House:**
  - Could be the swimmer, baseball player, or cricketer.

Let's try to place the soccer player:
- If the soccer player is in the second house:
  - The cricketer must be in the third, fourth, or fifth house.
  - The person with daffodils is in the second house.
  - The person who likes yellow is in the first house.
  - The person with lilies must be in the third house (since the person who likes red is directly left of them).
  - The person with tulips must be in the first or fourth house.
  - The person with carnations must be in the fourth or fifth house.
  - The person with a rose bouquet must be in the fourth or fifth house.

This doesn't work because the person with tulips and the baseball player must be next to each other, and the person with carnations must be to the right of the person with tulips.

- If the soccer player is in the third house:
  - The cricketer must be in the fourth or fifth house.
  - The person with daffodils is in the second house.
  - The person who likes yellow is in the first house.
  - The person with lilies must be in the fourth house (since the person who likes red is directly left of them).
  - The person with tulips must be in the first or fifth house.
  - The person with carnations must be in the fifth house.
  - The person with a rose bouquet must be in the fifth house.

This works:
- First house: Person who likes yellow, tulips, and could be the baseball player.
- Second house: Person with daffodils, could be the swimmer.
- Third house: Soccer player.
- Fourth house: Person with lilies, could be the cricketer.
- Fifth house: Person with carnations and a rose bouquet, could be the baseball player.

So, the swimmer lives in the **second house**.

The answer is **(B) 2**."

1. **The violinist lives in the first house.**
   - So, the person in House 1 is the violinist.

2. **The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper.**
   - This means the person with the computer must live in a house that is to the left of the bird keeper's house.
   - Since there are only two houses, the person with the computer must live in House 1, and the bird keeper must live in House 2.

So, the bird keeper lives in House 2.

- The person who had pizza (House 4) lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti (Clue 5). So, the person in House 5 ate spaghetti.
- The person who has a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes (Clue 3). Since the person in House 1 has a rose bouquet, the person in House 2 cannot have carnations. Therefore, the person in House 3 has carnations, and the person in House 4 is wearing running shoes.
- The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the mystery book reader (Clue 13). Since the person in House 4 is wearing running shoes, the person in House 3 cannot be wearing loafers.

- The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils (Clue 18). The person who has a computer also lives directly next to the person who is wearing running shoes (Clue 16). Since the person in House 4 is wearing running shoes, the person in House 3 has a computer.
- The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips (Clue 19). Since the person in House 3 has a computer, the person in House 4 cannot have daffodils. Therefore, the person in House 5 has daffodils, and the person in House 4 has tulips.
- The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the history book buff (Clue 6). Since the person in House 4 has tulips, the person in House 5 has daffodils, and the person in House 3 has a computer, the person in House 2 must have lilies. Therefore, the person in House 1 is the history book buff.
- The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils (Clue 11). Since the person in House 5 has daffodils, the person in House 2 must be the romance book lover.
- The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels (Clue 7). Since the person in House 2 is wearing loafers, the person in House 3 is the mystery book reader, and the person in House 4 is wearing running shoes, the person in House 5 must be wearing sandals, and the person in House 3 must be wearing high heels.
- The person who has a phone does not live in the fourth house (Clue 17). Since the person in House 3 has a television, the person in House 5 has daffodils, and the person in House 4 has tulips, the person in House 2 must have a phone.
- The person who has a radio must be in House 5.

So, the person who has a computer lives in House 3.

"A: (A) No

St. Vitus's Dance, which is also called Sydenham's chorea, makes a person's movements jerky and hard to control. Ballet needs very smooth and controlled movements. So, someone with St. Vitus's Dance would find it really hard to do ballet well and probably wouldn't win a competition."
"B: Yes

Pig Latin is a fun way for people to talk by changing the sounds of words. But pigs can't use Pig Latin because they don't speak like humans. They make their own sounds to talk to each other, like oinks and grunts. So, it's not possible for pigs to use Pig Latin."
"B: No

Ringo Starr, being a musician and not known for any specific dietary restrictions related to pot roast, would likely not avoid it just because it's pot roast. People usually avoid certain foods because of allergies, dietary preferences like being vegetarian or vegan, or personal taste. We don't have any information that suggests Ringo Starr has a problem with pot roast, so he probably wouldn't avoid it at a restaurant."
"B: Yes

The 1936 Summer Olympics were held in Berlin, Germany, and the main venue was the Olympiastadion. This stadium could hold about 110,000 people back then. But the Super Bowl is usually played in stadiums that can hold around 70,000 to 100,000 people, and they are packed full with almost every seat taken. The Super Bowl also has a lot of extra areas for people to move around, like big screens, food stands, and places to buy stuff. So, even though the Olympiastadion was big for its time, it might be a bit too small and not have enough space for all the extra things that make a Super Bowl game special."
"I'm not sure about that. But if I had to guess, I would say (A) No, because I don't know of any brown rock fish in the waters around Saint Kitts and Nevis. The waters there are more known for other types of fish like snapper and barracuda. But I could be wrong, and there might be brown rock fish there too!"
"(A) Yes

Growing seedless cucumbers can be good for a gardener with entomophobia because seedless cucumbers often require less pollination by insects. This means fewer bugs around the plants, which can help the gardener feel more comfortable while tending to their garden."
"Let's think about this step by step. Martin Luther is famous for his 95 theses. If he did one thesis a day, we need to figure out how many days it would take him to finish all 95.

So, 95 theses ÷ 1 thesis per day = 95 days.

Now, a half year is about 6 months. Each month has about 30 days, so:

6 months × 30 days per month = 180 days.

Since 95 days is less than 180 days, Martin Luther would finish his 95 theses before the half year is over.

So, the answer is (A) Yes, he would run out in half a year."
"B: Yes

Waltz is a smooth, flowing dance that's easy on the body. Slam dance is more rough and people can bump into each other and get hurt. So, waltz is less likely to cause injuries."

The 1943-S penny is made of steel and coated with zinc, not silver. So, it wouldn't be good for making silverware. Silverware needs to be made from silver or materials that look and act like silver to be shiny and durable for eating."
"B: Yes

It would be very hard to snowboard on Venus. Venus is a very hot planet. It's so hot that it can melt metal! There's no snow or ice there. The air is also very thick and full of clouds made of acid. So, it's not a good place for snowboarding at all."
"B: No

Charlemagne's father was named Pepin the Short. But it was actually Charlemagne's grandfather, Charles Martel, who was really important in the Battle of Tours. Charles Martel led the army that won the battle and stopped the Muslims from moving further into Europe.

Hermes is not the same as Vulcan. Hermes is a Greek god, and he's known for being the messenger of the gods. He's also the god of travel, trade, and thieves. In Roman mythology, the god that is similar to Hermes is Mercury. Vulcan, on the other hand, is the Roman god of fire and metalworking. In Greek mythology, he's called Hephaestus. So, Hermes and Vulcan are different gods with different roles."

Ariana Grande could be a topic of relevance in a presentation about post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). She has been open about her struggles with PTSD following the Manchester Arena bombing in 2017, where a terrorist attack occurred during her concert.

Talking about her experience can help people understand the impact of PTSD and how it can be managed."
"B: Yes

Jack Black is an actor and comedian, and Bear McCreary is a composer who makes music for movies and TV shows. They work in different parts of making movies and TV, so they don't usually get the same kinds of awards. That's why it's not likely they would be competing for the same award."

""Rick and Morty"" is a show that has some grown-up themes and can be a bit tricky for kids, especially those who might have a hard time with certain topics. In the show, Rick, the main character, sometimes drinks a lot, and this might be upsetting for children of alcoholics because it reminds them of difficult things at home. It's always a good idea for grown-ups to watch shows like this with kids to talk about what's happening and make sure they're okay."
"A: (A) No

Simon Cowell is a British music producer and television personality. Voting for Supreme Court judges is not something that happens in elections like voting for a president or a member of parliament. In the United States, the President nominates Supreme Court judges, and the Senate confirms them. Since Simon Cowell is not part of the U.S. government, he doesn't get to vote on this."
"A: No

Jack Dempsey was a famous boxer who lived a long time ago, from 1895 to 1983. Conor McGregor is a modern fighter who started his professional career in the 2010s. So, Jack Dempsey couldn't have seen Conor McGregor fight because he wasn't around when McGregor started fighting."
"B: No

"A: (A) Yes

Euphoria is a really happy and good feeling that some drugs can give you. But when people use drugs to feel this way all the time, it can lead to addiction. Addiction means the body gets used to the drug and needs it to feel good or even just normal. So, euphoria is linked to drug addiction because it's the good feeling that makes people want to use the drug again and again."
"I think the answer is (A) No. You see, Apollo is a Greek god, and he's really strong and has special powers. But D'Artagnan is a brave and clever musketeer from a story. Even though Apollo is a god, there are many famous D'Artagnans from different stories, and they are all very good at fighting and working together. So, I don't think even Apollo could beat all of them at once. Plus, it's not fair to compare a god to people from stories, but if we imagine it, I think the D'Artagnans might win because there are so many of them!"
"The answer is (B) Yes. Sunscreen is not helpful for the condition that killed Bob Marley. Bob Marley died from a type of cancer called melanoma, which is a serious skin cancer. While sunscreen can help prevent skin cancer by protecting your skin from the sun's harmful rays, it can't treat cancer once you have it. Bob Marley's cancer was found in his toe and spread to other parts of his body, which is why it was very serious. If you think you have any kind of skin problem, it's important to see a doctor."
"B: No

The French Defence starts with the move 1...e5, but actually, it's 1...e6. This opening is used against 1.e4 and is known for being solid and somewhat passive. The four-move checkmate, also known as the Scholar's Mate, usually goes 1.e4 e5 2.Bc4 Nc6 3.Qh5 Nf6 4.Qxf7#. The French Defence's first move 1...e6 doesn't directly prevent this sequence, but it changes the structure of the game, making it harder for White to quickly set up the Scholar's Mate. So, while the French Defence doesn't directly defend against the four-move checkmate, it steers the game into different lines where this checkmate is not a threat."
"(B) No

Water with chlorine in it, even if it's been a week, might not be safe to drink. Chlorine is used to kill germs in water, but it can still be harmful if there's too much of it. It's best to ask a grown-up or someone who knows about water safety to check if it's okay to drink. If you can smell the chlorine or if it tastes funny, it's better not to drink it."
"A dichromat is someone who has a type of color blindness. They might have trouble seeing some colors, but they can still see some differences in color and brightness.

Chlorine gas is usually a pale green color, and neon gas is a bright red-orange color. Even though a dichromat might not see all colors normally, they should still be able to tell the difference between a pale green and a bright red-orange because the colors are quite different and the brightness is also different.

So, the answer is (A) Yes, a dichromat could probably easily distinguish chlorine gas from neon gas."
"(B) No

Elizabeth I of England lived from 1533 to 1603. The play ""Dido, Queen of Carthage"" was written by Christopher Marlowe, and it is believed to have been first performed around 1587 to 1593. While it is possible that Elizabeth I could have seen it during her lifetime, there is no historical record that confirms she actually did. However, given that plays were often performed for the court, it's not impossible that she might have seen it. But since we don't have any proof, the safest answer is that we cannot say for sure she saw it, so the best answer is ""No."""
"A: (A) Yes

You can try to avoid internet trolls on Reddit by not responding to their comments, blocking or muting them, and reporting their behavior if it violates Reddit's rules. It's also a good idea to stay away from controversial topics or threads where trolls are more likely to show up. Remember, if someone is being mean or trying to upset you, it's okay to just walk away and find a nicer place to talk!"
"B: Yes

Sea turtles don't really understand or care about human things like quarantine. But with fewer people on the beaches and in the water, they might have an easier time laying their eggs and swimming around without being disturbed. So, in a way, they might be enjoying it more!"
"B: No

Jesus lived a long time ago, before the idea of the Easter Bunny came about. The Easter Bunny is a fun tradition that people have today, especially in Western countries, where kids look for eggs and get treats. But this wasn't part of Jesus' life or the stories about him. So, he wouldn't understand the Easter Bunny because it's a much newer idea."
"B: Yes

An elephant is much, much bigger and stronger than a macaque. Elephants are one of the largest land animals, while macaques are small monkeys. So, an elephant could easily defeat a male macaque."
"A: (A) No

Augustus wasn't his birth name. He was born as Gaius Octavius. Later, he was given the name Augustus, which means ""majestic"" or ""venerable,"" when he became the first Roman Emperor. It was like a special title to show how important and respected he was."
"The answer is (A) No. The Confederate states, just like the rest of the United States, spoke modern English before the Civil War. Old English is a very old language that was spoken a long, long time ago, way before the United States was even a country. It's like the great-great-grandparent of the English we speak today!"
"A: Yes

Robert Wadlow was the tallest person ever recorded, standing at 8 feet 11 inches tall. A German Shepherd, even a large one, usually stands about 2 feet or 24 inches tall at the shoulder. So, Robert Wadlow would definitely tower over a German Shepherd."
"(A) No

Ethanol, which is the type of alcohol found in drinks like beer, wine, and spirits, isn't good for your health if you drink too much of it. Jack Kerouac, the famous writer, liked to drink a lot, and that wasn't good for him. Drinking too much can hurt your liver and other parts of your body. So, ethanol was not beneficial to Jack Kerouac's health."
"(A) No

The most expensive color isn't necessarily blue. The cost of a color usually depends on how hard it is to make. For example, a color called YInMn blue, which is a bright blue, was only discovered recently and can be quite expensive because it's new and not easy to produce. But there are other colors that can be even more expensive, like a special red made from crushed insects or a deep black that absorbs almost all light. So, blue isn't always the most expensive color."
"B: No

Ryan Crouser is a very strong person because he's a shot putter, which means he throws heavy balls for sports. But a bengal fox, even though it's small and light, is a living animal. Animals can move and might not want to be thrown. It wouldn't be nice or safe to throw a bengal fox, even if someone could. So, the answer is no."
"B: Yes

Lord Voldemort, when he was the head of the Death Eaters, made a lot of rules that were very strict and mean. He didn't like people who weren't pure-blood wizards, which means wizards born to wizard parents. When he was a student at Hogwarts, he was already thinking about these ideas. If he had been in charge, he probably would have made rules that only pure-blood wizards could go to Hogwarts. Since Voldemort himself was a half-blood (his dad was a regular person, not a wizard), he might have said that he was an exception because he was so powerful. But based on his own rules, he would have been the kind of person who wouldn't be allowed in, so the answer is yes, he would have been barred from Hogwarts under his own rules."
"B: Yes

The Jackson 5 had five members: Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Michael. The Isley Brothers originally started with three brothers: O'Kelly, Rudolph, and Ronald. So, The Jackson 5 was a bigger family band than The Isley Brothers."
"B: No

You don't need to add lactobacillus to make pickles. When you make pickles, the lactobacillus bacteria that are naturally present on the cucumbers and in the environment help to ferment the pickles. You just need to create the right conditions, like using salt and keeping the pickles in a warm place, and the bacteria will do their job!"
"B: Yes

The Wall Street Crash of 1929 hurt many companies, including those in the robotics industry. When the stock market crashed, it caused a big problem for businesses and people lost a lot of money. This made it hard for companies to sell their products or get money to keep working on new inventions. So, even if there weren't as many robotics companies back then as there are now, the ones that existed would have been affected too."
"A: (B) Yes

Moon Jae-in was born in Geoje, South Korea. Khanbaliq was the old name for Beijing, which is in China. So, Moon Jae-in was born outside of Khanbaliq."
"B: Yes

People with Anorexia nervosa might be more likely to break a bone. This is because they don't eat enough food, which means their body doesn't get the important nutrients it needs to keep bones strong. When bones are not strong, they can break more easily."
"B: No

Sea shanties are songs that sailors sang on ships, especially during the age of sail. They helped with the rhythm of work like raising anchors or hoisting sails. People on the Oregon Trail traveled by wagons over land, not by sea, so they wouldn't have sung sea shanties. They might have sung other songs to keep their spirits up or to pass the time, but not sea shanties."
"A: (A) Yes

Michael Vick went to prison for running a dogfighting ring, which is very bad and hurt a lot of animals. But shooting a bald eagle can get you in big trouble too. Bald eagles are protected by special laws because they are important symbols for the United States and were once in danger of disappearing. If someone shoots a bald eagle, they can get fined a lot of money and even go to jail for up to two years for each eagle they hurt or kill. So, it's possible that shooting a bald eagle could get someone more prison time than Michael Vick got for his dogfighting crimes."
"B: No

Gandhi, who lived from 1869 to 1948, couldn't have watched the TV show Bonanza because it started in 1959, which is after he passed away. So, the answer is no."
"A: (A) No

Hornets are insects that live on land. They don't live in the ocean or help oceanographers learn about the sea. Oceanographers study the ocean and need information from the water, like how salty it is or what animals live there. Hornets can't give them that kind of information."
"A: (A) No

Wearing sandals at Esperanza Base, which is in Antarctica, wouldn't be very comfy. It's super cold there, and you need to wear warm boots to keep your feet from getting too cold or hurt by the ice and snow. Sandals are better for warm, sunny places where you don't have to worry about freezing!"
"A: (A) Yes

Grey seals can swim in the same kind of water as the subject of Moby Dick. Moby Dick is a story about a big white whale that lives in the ocean, and grey seals also live in the ocean. So, they can both be in the same water."
"A: No

A Trek 9000 is a type of bicycle, and bicycles don't need anchors to park. You can just lean them against a wall or use a bike rack."
"A: (A) No

You can see hippopotamuses in zoos all around the world, not just in Africa. But in the wild, they do live in Africa."
"B: No

People don't celebrate Earth Day with a tire fire. Earth Day is about taking care of our planet and doing things that help the environment, like planting trees, cleaning up parks, or learning about how to save energy and water. A tire fire would pollute the air and hurt the environment, which is the opposite of what Earth Day is all about."
"B: No

Buddy the Elf is a character from the movie ""Elf."" He lives in the North Pole and doesn't know many people outside of his elf friends and Santa. He doesn't really know anyone who works in publishing."
"B: Yes

A hamster can experience two leap years. Leap years happen every four years, and since hamsters usually live for about 2 to 3 years, some hamsters might be born just before a leap year and live long enough to see the next one. So, it's possible!"
"The answer is (A) No. Rahul Dravid is a famous cricket player from India, not a type of insect. Gryllidae is a family of insects that includes crickets, but Rahul Dravid is a person, so he doesn't belong to that family."
"The answer is (A) No. The 23rd Amendment gave people living in Washington, D.C. the right to vote for president. Puerto Rico is not affected by this amendment. Puerto Ricans can vote in presidential primaries but not in the general election for president unless they live in one of the 50 states or Washington, D.C."
"B: No

William Franklyn-Miller is an actor and not known to be a professional race car driver. NASCAR Cup Series races are very competitive and require a lot of specialized training and experience. So, it's unlikely that someone who is not a professional race car driver would be able to win a NASCAR Cup Series race."
"B: No

Jacques Duèze, who became Pope John XXII, lived a very long time ago, from 1244 to 1334. Richard Dawkins is a modern scientist who writes about evolution and religion. They lived in very different times, so they wouldn't have been friends. Also, they have very different views on religion, which might make it hard for them to be friends even if they lived at the same time."
"B: No

A pet macaque is a monkey, and monkeys are usually too big to hide under a desk. They also move around a lot and might make noises, so it wouldn't be easy to keep them hidden. Plus, it's not safe or fair to the monkey to keep it hidden like that. Monkeys need lots of space to play and be happy."
"B: No

Justin Bieber is a singer and Mike Pence was the Vice President of the United States. They have very different jobs. Justin Bieber wouldn't take over Mike Pence's position because he's not involved in politics."
"A: No

Most of the time, when you watch videos on YouTube, people don't just randomly give you advice about audiobooks. They usually talk about what the video is about, like games, music, or fun facts. But sometimes, if you're watching a video about books or stories, the person might mention an audiobook. That's not the same as getting unsolicited advice, though. It's more like a friendly tip if you're already interested in that kind of thing!"
"(A) Yes

In the UK, people use metres to measure lengths, but they also use other units like feet and inches, especially for some everyday things. But for official stuff and in schools, they use metres."
"B: No

Let me explain this in a simple way. Goofy is a famous cartoon character created by Art Babbitt, who worked for Walt Disney. Walt Disney was the boss, or employer, of Art Babbitt. Now, we're talking about the brother of Walt Disney, not Art Babbitt. There's no well-known information that suggests that Roy Disney, who was Walt's brother, committed an excommunicable offense, which is something very serious that could get you kicked out of the church. So, the answer is no."
"A: (A) Yes

Some mental disorders can be hidden because the person might look fine on the outside even if they are struggling on the inside. For example, someone with anxiety or depression might smile and act normal around others but feel very sad or worried when they are alone. It's important to be kind and understanding to everyone because we never know what someone else might be going through."
"A: (A) Yes

Paul Bunyan is a big, strong lumberjack from old stories. He's really good at chopping down trees and moving big logs. But being an urban planner is very different. Urban planners need to think about how to make cities work well for lots of people. They have to plan where to put houses, schools, parks, and roads. They also need to think about how to keep the air and water clean. Paul Bunyan might not know much about these things, so he probably wouldn't be a good urban planner."
"(A) Yes

Parsley can be found in different parts of the grocery store because it's used in many ways. You might see it in the fresh produce section, where it's sold as a bunch of green leaves. It can also be in the dried herbs section, where it's sold in little bottles or jars. So, it's normal to find parsley in more than one place!"
"A: No

Alcatraz Island is pretty small, and a football field needs a lot of space. The island is only about 22 acres, and most of it has buildings or is too rocky and steep. A football field is about 1.32 acres, but it needs flat space, and there's not enough flat area on Alcatraz to fit one."
"A: No

Kaffir lime is very sour and has a strong, unique taste. A White Russian is a sweet and creamy drink made with vodka, coffee liqueur, and milk or cream. The strong flavor of kaffir lime might not mix well and could make the drink taste too bitter or strange. It's better to stick with the classic recipe or try other mixers that go well with sweet drinks."
"B: No

Even if a goblin shark had limbs, it might not be able to ride a bike. Sharks are fish and their bodies are made for swimming in water, not for moving on land. Their muscles and bones are different from those of land animals, so they probably wouldn't have the right strength or coordination to ride a bike. Plus, they need water to breathe and stay alive, so being out of water for a long time would be very hard for them."
"B: Yes

Kurt Cobain was part of a music genre called grunge, which was really popular in the early 1990s. Even though he passed away, the music he made with his band Nirvana and the grunge style kept on being popular. Other bands that played similar music also continued to make songs, so the genre lived on after him."
"B: No

A spice grinder can still be useful for grinding cheaper cinnamon sticks. It might take a bit more effort or time to grind them into a fine powder, but it will work. Just make sure the cinnamon sticks are dry and not too big, so they fit well in the grinder."
"A: (A) Yes

A slingshot is not artillery. Artillery is big weapons that shoot big things, like cannons or rocket launchers. They are used by armies. A slingshot is small and you can hold it in your hand. It shoots small things like stones. So, calling a slingshot artillery would be wrong."
"A: (A) No

Soup is usually very liquidy and hot, so it's best to use a spoon to eat it. If you try to eat it with your hands, it might be messy and you could burn yourself."
"A: (A) No

Katy Perry is a pop singer, not a gospel singer. Most people follow her for her pop music, which is fun and catchy. Gospel music is a different kind of music that is usually about God and is sung in churches. So, it's not likely that most of her fans follow her for gospel music."
"B: No

The Capricorn symbol is a goat with a fish's tail, sometimes called a ""sea goat."" It doesn't have all the parts of a chimera. A chimera is a mythical creature that has parts from different animals, like a lion, a goat, and a dragon. So, Capricorn has just two parts, not all the parts of a chimera."
"B: No

Dafne Keen is an actress, not a singer. The Eurovision Song Contest is a singing competition, so she would not be participating as an actress. Also, the 2020 Eurovision Song Contest was cancelled because of the coronavirus, so no one could win that year."
"A: Yes

Iris and Hermes are both from ancient Greek mythology. They are known for being very fast and good at delivering messages. But, if they had to work at UPS, they might find it hard. In mythology, they can fly and use magic, but at UPS, they would have to follow rules, drive trucks, and lift heavy boxes. That might be new and tricky for them. Also, they are used to delivering messages quickly in magical ways, not by using a truck or following a schedule. So, they might struggle with the everyday tasks and rules of a modern job like working at UPS."
"A: No

Cookie Monster loves cookies, and cookies are usually made with ingredients like flour and sugar, which are not part of a Paleo diet. Paleo is about eating foods that people might have eaten a long time ago, like fruits, vegetables, and meat. So, Cookie Monster's favorite food isn't Paleo friendly."
"Let's think about this step by step.

First, we need to know what pi (π) is. Pi is a number that is about 3.14. It's the number you get when you divide the circumference of a circle by its diameter.

Next, we need to figure out what the square root of 5 is. The square root of 5 is a bit trickier because it's not a whole number. It's a number that, when you multiply it by itself, you get 5. This number is about 2.24.

Now, let's compare the two:
- Pi (π) is about 3.14
- The square root of 5 is about 2.24

Since 3.14 is bigger than 2.24, pi is in excess of the square root of 5.

So, the answer is (A) Yes."
"A: (A) Yes

Breast cancer is often associated with a pink ribbon. The pink ribbon is a symbol that helps people remember to think about breast cancer and support those who have it. It's like how we use a red heart to think about love."
"B: No

Lactic acid is something our body makes, especially when we exercise a lot. It's not bad to have it in your body. When you run or play and your muscles work hard, they make lactic acid. It helps give you energy. Usually, your body gets rid of it when you rest. So, having lactic acid is normal and not bad at all!"
"The answer is (A) No. The Gunpowder Plot was a plan to blow up King James I and the Houses of Parliament in 1605. Mary, Queen of Scots, had already been executed in 1587, long before the Gunpowder Plot happened. Her son, King James I, was the one who was targeted, but the plot failed. So, Mary's bloodline, which included James and his children, wasn't eliminated."
"B: No

Alice is a little girl in the story ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland."" Masonic Lodges are places where grown-up men meet to talk and do special activities together. They don't let children or women join. So, Alice couldn't join a Masonic Lodge because she is a child and a girl."
"B: No

A crocodile's bite is much stronger than a bull shark's bite. Crocodiles have very strong jaws and can bite down with a lot more force. So, a crocodile bite would hurt more than a bull shark bite."
"A: (A) No

Snow White is a fairy tale character, and the story doesn't really show good examples of consent. For instance, the prince kisses Snow White without her being able to say yes or no, because she is asleep. In real life, it's important that both people agree to something, and they should be awake and able to say what they want. So, Snow White's story isn't a good example of how to handle consent in real life."
"A: (A) Yes

Avengers comics are made by Marvel, not DC. So, they would be out of place in a store that only sells DC comics. It's like if you had a toy box just for your teddy bears, and someone put a toy car in there. It doesn't belong!"
"A: (A) Yes

Some people believe that rhinoceros horns can help with sex and other health problems, even though it's not true. Because of these beliefs, rhinos have been hunted for their horns, which has hurt their populations. It's important to protect animals and not believe in things that aren't proven to work."
"A: No

Members of NFL teams are professional football players. They train for football, not for military service. Infantry training is something that soldiers in the army go through, not football players. So, the correct answer is (A) No."
"I think the answer is (A) Yes. Bruce Lee was a student at the University of Washington, but I remember learning that he left school before he finished, so he wouldn't have been at the graduation ceremony in 1964. But I'm not totally sure, because I only know a little bit about him from what we learned in school."
"A: No

Zoroastrians follow the teachings of their own religion, which are found in their holy book called the Avesta. They wouldn't look to the Quran, which is the holy book of Islam, for religious guidance. Each religion has its own special books that its followers use to learn about their faith."
"B: Yes

Brooke Shields is a very smart and talented person. If she works hard and wants to go to a big school like the University of Pennsylvania, she can do it! Lots of people who are famous or who have done well in other areas can also do well in school if they try."
"B: No

A quarter is too big to fit inside a human kidney. Kidneys are about the size of a fist, and a quarter is bigger than what can fit inside them. Kidneys are important for cleaning our blood and helping us stay healthy, but they're not big enough to hold a coin like a quarter."
"B: No

Bruce Gandy is a very well-known and respected organist. He plays the organ really well, and the organ is a big part of the Messiah by Handel. So, it would make sense for him to play for a performance of the Messiah. It wouldn't be an odd choice at all!"
"B: No

Babies are born without hair on their upper lip, so they can't have a moustache. They might have some tiny, soft hairs, but that's not the same as a moustache. Moustaches are something that grows on older people, usually men, when they get bigger."
"B: No

The Treaty of Versailles was a very important meeting where countries talked about the rules after a big war. They didn't eat blueberry scones while making the treaty. They were too busy talking about serious things like borders and punishments for the countries that lost the war."
"A: No

Most people buy meat from the grocery store because they want it to taste a certain way, like chicken, beef, or pork. Game meat, like deer or rabbit, has a different, stronger taste that not everyone likes. If someone bought chicken and it tasted like game, they might be surprised and not in a good way. They might think the meat is not fresh or not what they wanted. So, the customer would probably not be happy."
"B: No

The founders of Skype are not from Asia. They are from Europe. Skype was created by Niklas Zennström from Sweden and Janus Friis from Denmark. They made Skype so people all over the world could talk to each other for free using their computers and the internet."
"I don't know who Sockington is, so I can't say if he likes onions or not. But if Sockington is a cat, like the famous internet cat, then he probably doesn't enjoy onions because cats usually don't like the taste of onions, and onions can even be bad for them. So, the best answer would be (A) No."
"B: No

Storks are big birds that don't really go to parties. In stories, people say storks bring babies, but in real life, we don't see storks at baby showers. Baby showers are parties where friends and family come together to celebrate a new baby and give gifts to the mom. So, you wouldn't see a stork there!"
"B: No

The Greek alphabet is much more common than Sumerian cuneiform. The Greek alphabet is still used today in Greece and in math and science. Sumerian cuneiform was used a very long time ago in ancient Mesopotamia and isn't used anymore."
"B: No

Secretariat was a very famous horse that won many big races, but he didn't win a Formula One championship. Formula One is a type of car racing, not horse racing. Secretariat was really good at running fast on a track, but he didn't drive cars!"
"B: Yes

A cattle farmer can be useful to a drum maker because the drum maker might need animal hides to make the drumheads. Cattle hides are strong and can make good drum skins. So, the cattle farmer can provide the hides that the drum maker needs."
"B: No

""Beam me up"" is a phrase from Star Trek, not Star Wars. Star Wars fans usually say things like ""May the Force be with you."""
"A: (A) Yes

Wearing an icon that shows a crucifix is usually okay. Many people wear crosses or crucifixes as necklaces or other jewelry. It's a common symbol in Christian faith, and lots of people who are Christian or just like how it looks wear them. But it's always good to be respectful of what symbols mean to different people."
"B: No

The Swiss Guard is a group of soldiers who protect the Pope and the Vatican City. They work in Italy, not in the United States. The Virginia General Assembly is a part of the government in Virginia, which is a state in the U.S. The people who sit in those chairs are elected by the people of Virginia to make laws for the state. So, the Swiss Guard can't fill those chairs because they have a different job in a different country."
"B: No

Placozoa are very simple animals. They don't have a brain or any kind of nervous system. Since learning disabilities usually affect the brain, placozoa can't have learning disabilities. They just don't have the parts needed for that."
"B: Yes

Bart Simpson could have owned comics with The Joker. Bart likes comic books and The Joker is a very famous character from Batman comics. So, it's totally possible that Bart could have some Batman comics featuring The Joker in his collection."
"B: No

50 Cent, whose real name is Curtis James Jackson III, and Jeffrey Atkins, better known as Ja Rule, have had a well-known feud. They didn't get along, especially back in the early 2000s. They had some arguments and even made songs about not liking each other. So, the answer is no, they don't get along."
"A: (A) No

In Somalia, the main religion is Islam, and while there are strict rules about behavior, being celibate, which means not having a sexual relationship, is not something that would cause people to want to harm a cleric. Celibacy is actually respected in many religious roles. So, a cleric who is celibate would not likely suffer a stoning for that reason."
"B: Yes

The Riksdag is the name of the parliament in Sweden, which is a country in Scandinavia. It's where the people's elected representatives meet to make laws and decide how the country should be run. So, it is definitely a political entity in Scandinavia."
"A: (A) No

Spaghetti shouldn't be slick when it's cooked. It should be a little bit sticky, but mostly separate and not too wet. When you cook it, you want it to be al dente, which means it's still a tiny bit firm in the middle. That way, it's perfect for eating!"
"B: Yes

Isaac Newton is often associated with an apple, which is a red fruit. The story goes that he was sitting under an apple tree when an apple fell on his head, which made him think about why things fall down and not up. This led to his ideas about gravity. Even though the story might not be completely true, it's a fun way to remember how Newton helped us understand gravity!"
"(A) No

A jackfruit is really big and heavy, like a big ball. If someone threw one at your head, it could hurt you a lot. It's not safe at all. Always be careful with heavy things, especially near your head."
"I think the answer is (B) Yes. Being poor or rich didn't change if Christopher Reeve lived or not. He was in a really bad accident that hurt his neck, and that's why he couldn't move. Money can help with some things, like getting the best doctors, but it couldn't change what happened to him. So, even if he was poor, he would still have lived, just maybe with different kinds of help."
"B: No

You see, mail carriers usually work on most days, even on some holidays. The birthday of a president, even if they were elected unanimously, isn't automatically a day off for mail carriers unless it's made into a federal holiday. And not all federal holidays are days off for mail carriers. For example, on Presidents' Day, which celebrates the birthdays of presidents, mail is still delivered!"
"A: No

Dyslexia is not an intellectual disability; it's a learning disorder. It makes it hard for people to read and spell, but it doesn't mean they're not smart. Intellectual disabilities are different; they affect how well someone can learn and understand things in general. So, dyslexia isn't the most common intellectual disability because it's not an intellectual disability at all."
"B: Yes

Jackie Chan is famous for his action movies and martial arts, but if he's trying to talk to someone who is deaf, he might have trouble if he doesn't know how to use sign language or other ways to communicate without speaking. Deaf people can't hear, so they use their eyes to understand what others are saying, often through sign language or by reading lips. If Jackie Chan doesn't know these ways, it could be hard for them to talk to each other."
"B: Yes

New York is much colder than Florida, especially in winter. In New York, it can get really cold with lots of snow and ice. If you don't have warm clothes or a place to stay warm, you could get very cold and that's called hypothermia. In Florida, it's usually warm, even in winter, so it's much less likely to get that cold there."
"B: No

John Kerry is an American politician and he didn't run in the 2010 United Kingdom general election. He's from the United States and was involved in American politics, not British politics."
"A: (A) Yes

Binary numbers and the standard alphabet can be used to make a strong password. A strong password is one that is hard for others to guess or figure out. Using both binary numbers (which are just 0s and 1s) and letters from the alphabet can make your password very strong because it has a mix of different characters. The more different types of characters you use, like numbers, letters, and even symbols, the harder it is for someone to guess your password. So, mixing binary numbers with letters is a good idea to make a strong password!"
"(A) No

A full circle rainbow is very rare to see. Usually, we only see part of a rainbow because the ground gets in the way. To see a full circle rainbow, you'd need to be high up, like in a plane or on a tall building, and the sun has to be low behind you and the rain in front. So, having lunch on the beach isn't a good place to spot a full circle rainbow."
"B: No

Abdulqawi Yusuf is a very important person. He works as the President of the International Court of Justice, which is a big court in The Hague, Netherlands. But, he doesn't go there every day like we go to school. He goes there for important meetings and to do his job when he needs to. So, on a typical day, he might not be there."
"A: No

Emma Roberts played Nancy Drew in the movie ""Nancy Drew."" Nancy Drew is a teenage detective who solves mysteries, but she's not a private investigator. She's more like an amateur detective who uses her smarts and skills to figure things out. Private investigators are grown-ups who get paid to solve cases and have special training. Nancy Drew just loves solving puzzles and helping people!"
"B: Yes

Nancy Pelosi and Gerald Ford were both members of the Republican Party early in their careers, but Pelosi later became a Democrat. However, they both have served as Speakers of the House, and they both have been known for their leadership and service to the country. Even though they belonged to different parties, they might have agreed on some issues, like supporting the military or certain economic policies. So, it's possible they could have been on the same side on some matters."
"A: (A) Yes

When there's a big explosion, like at a place where they keep gunpowder, it can make a really fast shock wave. This shock wave moves faster than the speed of sound, which is why we call it supersonic. It's like when you see a plane go by really fast and you hear a loud boom afterward. That's a supersonic shock wave! So, if there's an explosion at a gunpowder place, it would make a very loud and fast shock wave."
"A: No

People don't usually put creatures from the Black Sea on their pizza. Pizza toppings are usually things like cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, and vegetables. Seafood on pizza is usually things like shrimp or anchovies that you can find in stores. Creatures from the Black Sea are not common or easy to get for pizza."
"B: No

Bill Nye, also known as Bill Nye the Science Guy, was born in 1955. Franklin Delano Roosevelt was president before that, from 1933 to 1945. So, Bill Nye couldn't have voted for him because he wasn't old enough when Roosevelt was president."
"A: (A) Yes

Canada is part of the Commonwealth, which means it has a special relationship with the King or Queen of the United Kingdom as the head of state. The monarch's role in Canada is mostly symbolic, but it's still an important part of how the country is run."
"B: Yes

Guitarists often have fingers that can handle a bit more pain than average because they play their instruments a lot. When you play guitar, you press the strings down on the fretboard, and at first, it can hurt your fingertips. But over time, your fingers get used to it. They build up calluses, which are like tough spots on your skin, and these help protect your fingers from hurting so much. So, guitarists' fingers can handle more pressure and discomfort compared to people who don't play guitar."
"(B) Yes

Kami Rita is a very experienced mountain climber, especially known for climbing Mount Everest many times. But Mount Emei, even though it's not as tall as Everest, is still a big challenge. It's a sacred mountain in China with steep paths and steps. For someone like Kami Rita, it might be easier than for most people, but it's still a tough climb because it's different from the mountains he usually climbs. So, it would be difficult, but probably not as hard as the biggest mountains he's used to."
"B: No

Sudoku boxes usually have the numbers 1 through 9. Roman numerals can represent these numbers, but they look different and might be harder to use. For example, 1 is I, 2 is II, 3 is III, and so on. Using Roman numerals could make the game more confusing because some of the numbers take up more space and look more similar to each other, like IV (4) and VI (6). So, while you could technically use Roman numerals, it's not a good idea for playing Sudoku."
"The answer is (A) No. When it's daytime in Los Angeles, it's not dark in Basel. Los Angeles and Basel are in different time zones, but they both have day and night at different times. When it's daytime in one place, it's usually daytime somewhere else too, just not exactly the same time."
"A: No

Spirit is a Mars rover that stopped communicating with Earth in 2010. So, if it suddenly sent a broadcast in 2020, it would be really surprising and exciting! But it's not likely to happen because Spirit hasn't worked for a long time. If it did happen, though, it would definitely make the news because it would be a big deal! But based on what we know, the answer is no."
"B: Yes

Pancakes aren't good for cats because they have things in them that can make a cat's tummy hurt, like sugar and milk. Cats need special food that is made just for them to keep them healthy and happy. So, it's best not to give your cat pancakes."
"B: No

Nine Inch Nails is a rock band that makes music with a lot of electronic sounds and heavy drums. Aretha Franklin was known for her soul and gospel music, which is very different. She was singing before Nine Inch Nails even started making music. So, Nine Inch Nails didn't inspire Aretha Franklin's sound."
"B: No

Jon Brower Minnoch didn't have anorexia nervosa. He was actually the opposite; he was one of the heaviest people ever recorded. Anorexia nervosa is when someone is very afraid of gaining weight and doesn't eat enough, but Jon had a problem with eating too much."
"A: No, H.G. Wells' ""War of the Worlds"" doesn't talk about cosmic rays. The story is about aliens coming to Earth in big machines, not about rays from space."
"B: No

You don't need different colored pens for Sudoku. You can solve Sudoku puzzles just fine with a single pen or pencil. Colored pens might make it look prettier or help you see patterns better, but they're not necessary. The main thing is to have fun and think hard about where the numbers go!"
"B: No

The religions that consider the Himalayas sacred, like Hinduism and Buddhism, are much older than the 19th century. Hinduism is one of the oldest religions and has been around for thousands of years. Buddhism also started a long time ago, about 2,500 years ago. So, none of these religions started in the 19th century."
"A: (B) No

White rice doesn't go rancid like sesame seeds can. Rice can get stale or moldy if it's not stored properly, but it doesn't go rancid. Sesame seeds have oils in them that can go bad over time if they're not kept in a cool place, and that's called going rancid. So, sesame seeds are more likely to go rancid before white rice."
"B: No

Penicillin is a type of medicine that helps fight bacteria when you're sick, like when you have an ear infection or a bad cough. But it doesn't help with learning disabilities. Learning disabilities are different; they're about how your brain works when you're trying to learn or understand things. There's no medicine that can fix that, but there are lots of ways to help people with learning disabilities do well in school and in life."
"B: No

Cancer doesn't usually cause your body to make too much adrenaline. Adrenaline is a hormone that your body makes when you're stressed or scared. Some cancers can cause your body to make too much of other hormones, but not usually adrenaline. If someone has too much adrenaline, it's more likely due to other reasons, like a tumor in the adrenal gland, which is a different kind of problem."
"(A) No

Grizzly bears don't live in India, so the people in Vellore Fort didn't have to worry about them. Vellore Fort is in a place where you might find other animals, but not grizzly bears. They are mostly found in North America."
"A: No, the brain is not located in the torso. It's in your head, inside the skull."
"Let's think about this like we're solving a math problem in class.

First, we need to know how much space one hour of a Netflix show takes. It can be different, but let's say a good guess is that one hour of a show takes about 1GB of space. This is like saying one big book takes up one spot on a shelf.

Now, if you want to save 10 hours of shows, that would be 10GB. This is like having 10 big books on the shelf.

If you do this every day, in one day you would use 10GB. In two days, you would use 20GB, and so on.

A 500GB USB device is like having a really big shelf that can hold 500 big books. If you put 10 books on the shelf every day, how many days would it take to fill up the shelf?

500GB ÷ 10GB/day = 50 days

So, a 500GB USB device can hold 10 hours of Netflix shows for 50 days. If you only want to save 10 hours of shows for one day, then yes, 500GB is more than enough!

The answer is (B) Yes."
"To answer this, we need to know how much Jon Brower Minnoch weighed and how heavy Voyager 2 was when it was launched.

Jon Brower Minnoch was very, very heavy. At his heaviest, he weighed about 1,400 pounds (635 kg). That's really, really heavy—like having a small car on a chair!

Voyager 2, the space probe, when it was launched, was much lighter. It weighed about 1,820 pounds (825 kg) including its fuel. But that's still a lot lighter than Jon Brower Minnoch when he was at his heaviest.

So, if we're talking about breaking a chair, a chair that could hold Voyager 2 would probably be a very strong chair, maybe even made for space stuff. But a regular chair that Jon Brower Minnoch might sit in would likely break because he was so much heavier.

So, the answer is (A) Yes, Jon Brower Minnoch would likely break a chair before Voyager 2's launch mass."
"B: No

A hedgehog wouldn't really think about whether other animals have a spine or not. They are more interested in finding food and staying safe. Hedgehogs eat all sorts of things like insects, which don't have backbones, so they wouldn't avoid animals without a spinal cord."
"A: (A) No

The scientific revolution started way before the iPhone was even a thought! It began a long, long time ago, around the 1500s and 1600s. That's when smart people like Galileo and Newton made big discoveries about the world and how things work. The iPhone is a cool gadget that came out in 2007, and it changed how we use phones and computers, but it didn't start the scientific revolution."
"B: No

In American Sign Language (ASL), whether you are right-handed or left-handed doesn't really change how you sign. Most signs are designed to be used by both right-handed and left-handed people. Some people might make small changes to make signing more comfortable for their dominant hand, but the meaning of the signs stays the same. So, handedness doesn't determine how you use ASL."
"(A) No

Lolcats are actually cats, and just like any other pet, they need food to be healthy and happy. Taking care of a pet means making sure they have enough to eat, so buying food for a Lolcat is not unnecessary. It's an important part of being a good pet owner."
"(A) No

Garfield is a cat, and cats are not canids. Canids are animals like dogs, wolves, and foxes. Garfield would like cat food, not dog food, because it's made for cats to eat and has the right nutrients for him."
"B: Yes

Silicon wedding rings are much more common and practical for everyday use. Silicon is a strong, durable material that can be made to look very nice. Bromine, on the other hand, is a chemical element that is a liquid at room temperature and is not used to make wedding rings. So, silicon wedding rings will definitely outsell bromine wedding rings."
"A: (A) Yes

When people hear about the YMCA, many think of the fun song by the Village People called ""Y.M.C.A."" It's a very catchy song that a lot of people know, and it has a part where you can sing along and make the letters Y-M-C-A with your arms. So, it's pretty normal for people to start singing when they hear about the YMCA!"
"B: No

United Airlines wasn't blameless in the worst crash in history. The worst crash in aviation history was the Tenerife airport disaster in 1977, but it involved two planes, one of which was a United Airlines flight. However, the crash was mainly due to a series of misunderstandings and bad weather, not just one airline's fault. But United Airlines could have done things differently to prevent the crash. So, they weren't completely blameless."
"A: No

The Liberty Bell isn't in its original spot anymore. It used to be in the Pennsylvania State House, which we now call Independence Hall. But now, it's in a special building called the Liberty Bell Center, right next to Independence Hall. They moved it there so more people could see it and learn about its history."
"A: No

Bowling pins and Oscars are very different things. Bowling pins are tall and skinny, made to stand up and be knocked down. Oscars are short, heavy statues. They wouldn't work as bowling pins because they're not the right shape or size, and they're too valuable to use like that. Plus, it wouldn't be fair to Mr. Hoffman to use his awards like that. So, the answer is no, you can't use Dustin Hoffman's Oscars as bowling pins."
"A: No

Beavers have really strong teeth, but they are not like the teeth of a Smilodon. Beavers have big, flat teeth called incisors that help them cut and chew wood. Smilodons, also known as saber-toothed cats, had very long, sharp teeth called canines that they used to hunt and kill their prey. So, while both animals have impressive teeth, they are very different and used for different things."
"B: Yes

Rivers played a big part in the start of agriculture. They provided water for crops and made the soil rich and good for growing food. Ancient people figured out they could grow more food near rivers, which helped them settle down and start farming."
"B: No

In the US education system, art is not always given the same priority as subjects like math, science, and reading. Schools often focus more on these core subjects because they are important for tests and future jobs. But many people think art is very important too, because it helps kids be creative and express themselves. Sometimes, if there's not enough money, art programs might get less support or even be cut."
"B: No

Kurt Cobain was the singer of the band Nirvana, and he sadly passed away in 1994. Daniel LeFever is known for making shotguns, which is a type of gun, but he lived a long time ago, in the 1800s. So, Daniel LeFever couldn't have had anything to do with Kurt Cobain's death because they lived in very different times."
"A: No

A two-year-old is too little to know all the words and rules needed to play Scrabble. They are still learning to talk and wouldn't know how to spell or make words with the tiles. So, they couldn't win a Scrabble tournament."
"B: Yes

Harry Potter, just like any other person, can book a flight on Asiana Airlines. Being a fictional character doesn't stop him from doing things that normal people do, like traveling on airplanes, in the stories. So, if he wanted to, he could book a flight!"
"B: No

Steven Spielberg was born in 1946. Email didn't become available to the general public until much later, in the 1980s. So, when he was a child, there was no email for him to use."
"B: No

Theodor Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, became famous for his imaginative stories and unique illustrations, not because of the color green. While he did use green in his books, like the Grinch and the eggs in ""Green Eggs and Ham,"" it was his creativity and storytelling that made him popular."
"B: Yes

The Lighthouse of Alexandria was built in Egypt, but it was designed by a Greek architect named Sostratus. The Greeks were really good at building and engineering, so they played a big part in making this famous lighthouse. It was one of the tallest buildings in the world at that time and helped ships find their way safely into the harbor. So, the Greeks were very important in building it!"
"B: Yes

Keith Richards, the famous rock star from the Rolling Stones, did play a captain in a movie. He appeared as Captain Teague in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies. It's a fun role he played, kind of like a pirate captain!"
"B: Yes

Preventive healthcare can help stop STIs from spreading. When people get checked early and learn how to stay safe, like using condoms, it helps a lot. Doctors can also give medicine to treat some STIs, which stops them from passing to others. So, preventive care is really good for keeping everyone healthier and safer."
"B: No

The story of Jesus is part of the Christian faith and is based on the teachings found in the Bible. While some people might say there are similarities between stories from different cultures, the story of Jesus is unique and special to Christianity. It's like how different families might have similar bedtime stories, but each family has their own special way of telling them."
"A: (B) No

Methuselah is a person from the Bible who is said to have lived for 969 years. But he lived a very, very long time ago, way before what we call the Common Era started. The Common Era is the time period that starts from the year 1 AD. So, even though Methuselah lived for a really long time, he wouldn't hold a record in the Common Era because he wasn't alive during that time."
"(A) Yes

People from Burundi and New Brunswick can talk to each other! They might use different languages, but they can use translators or learn a bit of each other's language to say hello and talk. In today's world, we have many ways to communicate, like the internet, which helps people from different places understand each other."
"(B) Yes

A pacifist is someone who believes in non-violence and tries to avoid hurting others, including animals. So, a pacifist would likely be against hunting because it involves killing animals."
"B: Yes

The American flag has 13 stripes. If the voice actors for Goofy and Bugs Bunny each get one stripe, that would only be 2 stripes out of the 13. So, they can each get one stripe and there would still be 11 stripes left on the flag."
"B: No

SnapCap is not a retail store. It's a company that helps other businesses get money they need to grow, kind of like when you borrow a toy from a friend but you have to give it back later. Retail stores are places where you go to buy things like toys, clothes, or food."
"B: No

The Statue of Liberty is in New York, and the Statue of Freedom is in Washington, D.C. They are very far apart, so you can't see one from the other."
"B: Yes

Jason and Dr. Disrespect both play video games and stream them online. They like to entertain people while they play, so they have that in common. Dr. Disrespect is a very famous gamer, and Jason might look up to him or even try to be like him in some ways."
"B: No

Even though deaf people can't hear music the way we do, they can still enjoy it! They can feel the vibrations and the rhythm. Some deaf people put their hands on speakers or stand on the floor near speakers to feel the music. It's like feeling a heartbeat, but it's the heartbeat of the music! So, they can enjoy music in their own special way."
"B: No

Mount Sharp is on Mars, and no human has walked on Mars yet. So, there are no human footprints on Mount Sharp."
"A: (A) No

Lionel Richie is a singer who was born in 1949. Abraham Lincoln was the 16th President of the United States and he lived a long time ago, from 1809 to 1865. So, they could not have had dinner together because they did not live at the same time."
"A: (A) Yes

Honey is often associated with queens because in a beehive, the queen bee is very important. She's like the leader of all the bees. The bees make honey, and the queen bee gets to eat it. Also, sometimes people call a sweet girl or a leader in a group a ""honey"" or a ""queen."" So, honey and queens are connected in these ways."
"A: (A) No

The Eiffel Tower wasn't around during the French Revolution. It was built much later, in 1889, for the World's Fair. The French Revolution happened way back, starting in 1789. So, the Eiffel Tower is not a symbol of the French Revolution."
"The largest bone in your body is the femur, which is in your thigh, and the smallest is the stapes, which is in your ear. If we're talking about protecting your torso, these bones don't really help shield it. The femur is too far down, and the stapes is inside your head. So, the answer is (A) No, the torso won't be safe from blows just because of these bones. Your ribs and spine are the bones that help protect your torso."
"B: Yes

Şerafeddin Sabuncuoğlu lived a long time ago in a place called Turkey. Börek is a yummy food that people in Turkey have been eating for a very long time. So, it's very likely that he would have eaten Börek, just like many people do today!"
"Let's think about this step by step. King Kong climbed the Empire State Building in the movie. The Empire State Building is really tall, but how tall is it compared to the Eiffel Tower?

The Empire State Building is about 443 meters tall if you include the antenna. The Eiffel Tower is about 330 meters tall if you include the antennas. So, the Empire State Building is taller than the Eiffel Tower.

Since King Kong was at the very top of the Empire State Building, he was at a higher altitude than the visitors at the top of the Eiffel Tower.

So, the answer is (B) Yes."
"A: (A) No

Dessert is usually eaten after the main meal, not before breakfast. Breakfast is the first meal of the day, and we usually start with light foods like cereal, toast, or fruit. Dessert is sweet and we save it for after lunch or dinner."
"B: Yes

Disney's second film, ""Pinocchio,"" has some elements that can be compared to stories from different cultures and religions, including some prophet stories. For example, the idea of a character coming to life and going on a journey to become a better being can be seen in various tales. However, it's important to note that ""Pinocchio"" is based on the Italian children's novel by Carlo Collodi and not directly on any specific religious story. But some people might see similarities and think it ""ripped off"" certain themes."
"(A) No

Mercury is a planet, and it doesn't help detect coronavirus. We use special tests and tools, like thermometers to check if someone has a fever, or swabs to test for the virus itself. Planets don't help with that."
"Let's think about this step by step. Alec Baldwin has five children. Clint Eastwood has seven children. So, Alec Baldwin has fewer children than Clint Eastwood.

The answer is (B) No."
"B: Yes

The word ""swastika"" does have a meaning in Sanskrit. It comes from the Sanskrit word ""svastika,"" which means something like ""it is well"" or ""good fortune."" It's a very old symbol that was used in many cultures, but it's especially important in some religions like Hinduism, where it's a sign of good luck and well-being."
"B: Yes

The voice of the Genie from Disney's Aladdin, Robin Williams, passed away in 2014. But for the newer movies, they found someone else to do the Genie's voice. So, the original voice isn't with us anymore, but the Genie's character is still alive in the movies!"
"A: Yes

Karl Marx wrote about how workers should own the things they make and how everyone should share what they have. His ideas were very important and they helped form the beliefs of the Communist Party of China. The leaders in China read Marx's ideas and used them to create a government where they try to make sure everyone has enough to live a good life. So, Marx's ideas did influence the Communist Party of China a lot."
"(A) Yes

Spaghetti is usually made from wheat, which has gluten in it. People with celiac disease need to avoid gluten because it can make them very sick. So, a celiac sufferer should avoid regular spaghetti and look for gluten-free options instead."
"To answer this, we need to think about how much money Michael Bloomberg has and how much debt Micronesia has.

Michael Bloomberg is very rich. He has billions of dollars. Micronesia is a small country with a population of about 110,000 people. Its debt is not as big as that of larger countries.

If we look at the numbers, even though I don't know the exact figures, it's likely that Michael Bloomberg could cover Micronesia's debt for a decade because his wealth is so much larger compared to the country's needs.

So, the answer is (A) Yes."
"B: Yes

The Powerpuff Girls are named Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup. All their names start with the letter 'B', which makes them alliterative. Alliteration is when words in a sentence start with the same sound. So, the names of The Powerpuff Girls are a good example of alliteration!"
"B: No

Dosa is made from rice and lentils, which are high in carbohydrates. A keto diet is very low in carbs, so eating dosa would make it hard to stay in ketosis. If someone really wants to eat dosa, they might try a low-carb version, but regular dosa isn't keto-friendly."
"(A) No

Andy Warhol was famous for his pop art, which came after Art Deco. Art Deco was popular in the 1920s and 1930s, while Warhol became famous in the 1960s. So, Warhol didn't influence Art Deco, but he did make a big impact on pop art!"
"B: Yes

In Mumbai, people would call Solanum melongena an eggplant. But sometimes, they might also call it a brinjal. Both names are used, but eggplant is more common in English."
"Let's think about this step by step. Mount Fuji is a very tall mountain in Japan. It's about 3,776 meters (or about 12,388 feet) high. The Sea of Japan is a body of water that's pretty deep, but not as deep as Mount Fuji is tall.

The deepest part of the Sea of Japan is about 3,742 meters (or about 12,277 feet) deep. So, if you put Mount Fuji in the deepest part of the Sea of Japan, its top would still stick out of the water!

So, the answer is (B) Yes! The top of Mount Fuji would stick out of the Sea of Japan."
"B: Yes

A chess board and a Shogi board are both made up of squares, but they look a little different. A chess board has 8 squares by 8 squares, making 64 squares in total. A Shogi board has 9 squares by 9 squares, making 81 squares in total.

You can try to use a chess board for Shogi, but you would need to add an extra row and an extra column to make it work properly. Some people might use a chess board and just ignore one row and one column, or they might draw or tape extra lines to make the board bigger. It's not perfect, but it can work if you don't have a real Shogi board!"
"(A) Yes

An anxious person might feel better if they got courage from the Wizard of Oz. In the story, the Cowardly Lion gets courage and it helps him feel braver. So, if an anxious person got something like that, it could help them feel less worried and more brave to face their fears."
"I don't know for sure if Steve Martin would refuse a dish of shrimp pasta. Steve Martin is a famous actor and comedian, but I don't have any special information about what foods he likes or doesn't like. People can have all sorts of different tastes in food. The best answer is:

(B) No

Because we can't say for sure that he would refuse it. He might like it or he might not, but we don't have enough information to say ""Yes"" to the question."
"A: (A) No

Cape Town is in South Africa, which is below the Equator. But when we say ""south of the Equator,"" we mean it's in the Southern Hemisphere. So, Cape Town is indeed south of the Equator. The correct answer is (B) Yes."
"A: (A) No

A leap year baby born in 1996 would not be 1 year old in 2000. They would be 4 years old because a year is a full 12 months, and from 1996 to 2000 is 4 years. Leap years just mean there's an extra day in February, but it doesn't change how we count years."
"A: (A) No

Kobe is famous for its beef, which comes from a specific type of cow called the Wagyu. A BLT is a sandwich made with bacon, lettuce, and tomato. So, Kobe beef isn't used in a BLT."
"To answer this, I need to think about how many times each of them got married.

Clark Gable, he was a famous actor, and I remember he was married three times. His marriages were to Josephine Dillon, Ria Langham, and Kay Williams.

Richard Burton, he was also a famous actor, and he was married twice to the same woman, Elizabeth Taylor. They had a very famous relationship and got married, divorced, and then married again.

So, if we count the number of different women they married:
- Clark Gable married 3 different women.
- Richard Burton married 2 different women (even though it was the same woman twice).

So, the answer is (A) Yes, Clark Gable did marry more women than Richard Burton."
"B: Yes

It would be unusual to see frost in September in Texas. Texas is known for its hot weather, especially in the summer, which usually extends into early fall. Frost typically happens when it gets very cold, close to or below freezing. In Texas, it usually doesn't get that cold until much later in the year, like in winter. So, seeing frost in September would be pretty rare!"
"B: Yes

Mickey Mouse is a cartoon character and doesn't have a real job or money to spend. So, it's unlikely he would make a purchase at Zazzle or any other store. Plus, Zazzle is a place where people make their own designs on stuff like t-shirts and mugs. Mickey probably has all the clothes and toys he needs from Disney!"
"A: (A) Yes

The Chinese calendar includes 12 animals, and some of them are part of the phylum Chordata. Chordata includes animals with a backbone, like the dragon (which is a mythical creature but often depicted with a backbone), the snake, and the horse. So, the answer is yes!"
"B: No

Halloween is in October, and that's still hurricane season in the Gulf of Mexico. Hurricanes can happen, and they can be very dangerous. So, a Halloween cruise might not be safe from storms. It's always good to check the weather forecast before going on a cruise."
"The answer is (A) No.

Phileas Fogg's journey around the world, which is from the story ""Around the World in Eighty Days,"" doesn't really have anything to do with when Pope John Paul I was the Pope. Pope John Paul I was only Pope for a very short time, from August 26 to September 28, 1978. Phileas Fogg's trip could be done at any time, as long as there are ways to travel around the world, like trains and ships. So, whether it was during Pope John Paul I's time or not, it wouldn't make the trip harder or easier."
"B: No

The Spice Girls are a pop music group, and they don't play team sports. ŽRK Kumanovo is a women's handball team from North Macedonia. So, the Spice Girls wouldn't be able to compete against them in a handball game."
"A: (B) No

Cooking carrots can actually help you get more vitamin A from them. When carrots are cooked, the tough cell walls break down, making the vitamin A easier for your body to absorb. So, if you want to get the most vitamin A, it's better to eat your carrots cooked!"
"(A) No

You don't need to be in eleventh grade to get a driver's license. Different places have different rules, but usually, you just need to be a certain age, pass a test, and meet other requirements like taking a driver's education class. Check with your local DMV to know for sure!"
"B: No

Iggy Pop, whose real name is James Newell Osterberg Jr., wasn't named after his father. He chose the stage name ""Iggy Pop"" himself. The name ""Iggy"" might sound a bit like a fun, made-up name, kind of like how some kids pick nicknames for themselves!"
"I think the answer is (B) Yes. Cyndi Lauper might use a milk substitute in her rice pudding if she prefers it or if she has dietary restrictions like being lactose intolerant or vegan. Lots of people use things like almond milk, soy milk, or oat milk these days for yummy and healthy options!"
"B: No

Olive oil is good for cooking and making food taste yummy, but it can't help with sicknesses like rabies. Rabies is a very serious disease that needs special medicine from a doctor. If someone thinks they might have rabies, they should go to the hospital right away."
"A: (A) No

Chinchillas are not cold-blooded. They are mammals, and mammals are warm-blooded. This means their body temperature stays about the same even when it's cold or hot outside. Cold-blooded animals, like lizards and snakes, have body temperatures that change with the weather."
"A: (A) No

Eskimos, who are also known as Inuit, live in very cold places like Alaska, Canada, and Greenland. It's not very sunny there, and when it is, it's still pretty cold. So, they don't sunbathe like people in warmer places do. They spend a lot of time staying warm and dry instead."
"A: No

Onions have lots of good stuff in them that can make your food taste yummy and are good for your health. But they don't have anything that can be used to make a bomb, especially not a really big and dangerous one like a thermonuclear bomb. Those kinds of bombs need special materials that are very hard to get and are controlled by the government. So, onions are safe to eat and cook with, but they can't be used for making bombs."
"B: No

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union wouldn't like Trickle Down Economics. They believed in making sure everyone had what they needed by sharing things equally. Trickle Down Economics is more about letting rich people get richer and hoping some of that wealth will help everyone else later, which is not what the Communists wanted."
"B: Yes

A student in eleventh grade would be too young to run for president of the United States. The Constitution says you have to be at least 35 years old to be president. Most eleventh graders are around 16 or 17 years old, so they're not old enough yet."
"A: (A) Yes

There is a Marvel villain named Mandarin. The mandarin is also a type of citrus fruit, like an orange but smaller and sweeter. So the answer is yes, there is a Marvel villain with the same name as a kind of citrus fruit."
"To answer this, let's think about it step by step.

First, we need to know how many people were in Ashland, Oregon in 2018. According to the information I have, Ashland had about 21,000 people in 2018.

Now, let's think about what a military division is. A military division is a big group of soldiers. In the U.S. Army, a division usually has about 10,000 to 20,000 soldiers.

So, if Ashland had about 21,000 people, that's enough to make up a military division, but remember, not everyone in a city can be a soldier. There are kids, older people, and people who might not be able to serve for other reasons.

But just in numbers, 21,000 is enough to form a military division. So, the population of Ashland in 2018 is not inadequate to be a hypothetical military division.

The answer is (A) No."
"B: Yes

Disney is associated with Los Angeles County because there are Disney-related places there, like Disney California Adventure Park and Disneyland, which are both in Anaheim. Anaheim is a city in Los Angeles County. So, the answer is yes!"
"A: (A) Yes

Christopher Columbus was born in Italy, but he sailed for Spain. He went on big boat trips to find new places for the Spanish kings and queens. So, he did represent a different country than where he was from."
"B: Yes

Ropes are very important on a frigate, which is a type of ship. They are used for many things like tying the ship to the dock, controlling the sails, and helping to move heavy objects. So, ropes are definitely needed to operate a frigate."
"B: Yes

The Library of Alexandria was a very big and important library in ancient times, but we think it had fewer books than the Library of Congress, which is a huge library in the United States today. So, the Library of Alexandria would probably need less shelf space."
"A: (B) No

Paratroopers are really good at jumping out of planes and fighting in wars. But mountain rescue is a different job. It's about saving people who get hurt or lost in the mountains. People who do mountain rescue need to know a lot about climbing and how to help sick or hurt people in tough places. So, paratroopers might be brave and strong, but they're not usually trained for mountain rescue."
"B: Yes

Quiet from Metal Gear is a character who is very quiet and doesn't talk much. She's really good at being a sniper and fighting, but she's not a teacher. At Haub, which is a school for business, they need teachers who can explain things clearly and help students learn about business stuff. Quiet might be brave and strong, but she wouldn't be good at teaching business classes because that's not what she knows how to do. So, she would probably not be a good choice for a lecturer there."
"B: Yes

Watermelons grow better in warm places. Brazil is a big country that is warm most of the time, so it's a good place for growing watermelons. Antarctica is very cold and icy, so it's not a good place for growing watermelons or most other plants. So, more watermelons are grown in Brazil than in Antarctica."
"A: (A) No

SNL, or Saturday Night Live, is a funny TV show that sometimes makes jokes about famous people. But it's just a show, and the jokes are usually not serious enough to make real-life family members stop getting along. If Jenny McCarthy and her cousin aren't getting along, it's probably because of something that happened between them, not because of a TV show."
"B: Yes

You see, toilet paper is made from trees, and loggers are the people who cut down trees. If there were no loggers, we wouldn't have the wood pulp needed to make toilet paper. So, it would be really hard to get toilet paper without loggers."
"B: No

A silverfish is a very small insect, and the Empire State Building is super tall! It would take a silverfish way too long to climb all the way up, and it probably wouldn't even be able to find enough food or the right places to rest along the way. Plus, the wind and other things outside would make it really hard for such a tiny bug to make it all the way to the top."
"B: No

Armadillos have hard shells, but they are small animals and their shells aren't big or strong enough to protect a person like a shield. Plus, armadillos need their shells to protect themselves, so taking one to use as a shield wouldn't be nice to the armadillo. It's better to use things made for protection, like real shields or helmets, which are designed to keep people safe."
"B: Yes

Siri can know about geometry because it's a smart assistant that can learn lots of things, just like how you learn in school. Siri can help with geometry problems, like figuring out the area of a shape or what a right angle is. But remember, even though Siri knows a lot, it's always good to learn and understand things yourself too!"
"B: No

Largemouth bass are not native to the Canary Islands. They usually live in freshwater places like lakes and rivers, but the Canary Islands don't have many of these. Also, largemouth bass are more common in North America. So, it's not likely that someone could fish for largemouth bass in the Canary Islands."
"A: (A) No

Sloths don't explode if they're not upside down. They usually hang upside down from trees because it's easier for them to move and eat leaves that way. But if a sloth is right side up, it won't explode or anything like that. It might just be a bit uncomfortable or have a harder time moving around."
"B: No

Watching a whole TV series like EastEnders takes a lot of time. Your body needs water to stay healthy and feel good. If you don't drink water for a long time, you might get a headache or feel very tired. So, it's important to take breaks and drink water while you watch TV."
"I think the answer is (B) Yes. Sea World and places like it keep animals in small spaces that aren't like their natural homes. This can make the animals stressed and sick. Leopard seals are used to swimming in big oceans, not small pools. So, it's not good for their health."
"A: No

I don't think a Polish poet wrote sonnets about the Islamic religion. Polish poets usually write about things that are close to their own culture and history. But, I could be wrong because there are many poets and they can write about anything they want! If you're curious, we could look it up in a book or ask a teacher who knows more about poetry and history."
"(B) Yes

Coast to Coast AM has been on the air since 1989, and it's still going strong! The Rush Limbaugh Show started in 1988, but it ended in 2021 when Rush passed away. So, Coast to Coast AM has been around longer and is still on the air, making it the one with more longevity."
"B: Yes

A pound sterling is valuable. It's like the money people use in the United Kingdom, and it's one of the strongest currencies in the world. That means it can buy a lot of things, and people in many countries think it's worth a lot."
"(A) No

The Forbidden City is a very old and important place in Beijing, China. It was where the emperors used to live. It has lots of beautiful old buildings and rooms, but it doesn't have any rollercoasters or fun rides like that. It's a place to learn about history and see beautiful art and architecture."
"I think the answer is (A) No. Felicity Huffman is an actress who has shown support for more liberal causes. Mike DeWine is a Republican, so it's not likely that she would vote for him. But remember, everyone can choose who to vote for based on what they think is best!"
"B: No

Iron Chef is a cooking show that started in Japan in the 1990s. When Korea was under Japanese rule, which was from 1910 to 1945, there were no TV shows like Iron Chef because TV wasn't invented yet. People back then didn't have TVs in their homes. They listened to the radio or read newspapers for news and entertainment. So, people in Korea during that time didn't watch Iron Chef or any other TV shows."
"I think you might be a bit confused, sweetie. The question about a thousand dollars per episode of Days of Our Lives doesn't really make sense in the way you're asking. Shows don't usually get paid per episode like that. Actors and people who work on the show get paid, but not the show itself. And I'm not sure what you mean by ""preferred to other soaps."" Do you mean if it's more popular or if it gets more money? Can you tell me a bit more about what you're asking?"
"A: (A) Yes

Black-tailed jackrabbits, like many smaller animals, are likely to be afraid of predators like the European wildcat. Wildcats hunt smaller animals for food, so the jackrabbits would try to stay away to keep themselves safe."
"(A) No

The Forbidden City is open to visitors now. It used to be a place where only the emperor and his family could go, but now anyone can visit if they buy a ticket. It's a big, beautiful place with lots of old buildings and interesting things to see."
"A: (A) Yes

Some people, especially Native Americans, see Thanksgiving as a day of mourning because it reminds them of the hardships and suffering their ancestors went through when the Europeans arrived. It's a time when they remember the loss of their lands, cultures, and many lives. So, while many celebrate with a big meal and thanks, others use the day to reflect on this history."
"A: (A) Yes

England, which is part of the United Kingdom, was involved in the early part of the Arab-Israeli conflict. After World War I, the British controlled a region called Palestine, where both Jewish and Arab people lived. The British had a hard time keeping peace between these two groups. When Israel became a country in 1948, it led to a war with its Arab neighbors, and the British had to leave the area. So, England was directly involved in the beginning of the conflict."
"B: No

You can't drown in a Swan Lake performance because it's a ballet, which is a type of dance show. The dancers perform on a stage, not in water. Even though there are swans in the story, they are people dressed up as swans, and the lake is just part of the story, not a real lake. So, you don't have to worry about drowning when you watch it!"
"A: (A) No

Furniture is usually made of things like wood, metal, plastic, or fabric. Hair is too soft and not strong enough to make furniture that can hold up heavy things or last a long time. So, we don't use hair to make furniture."
"I don't know Tony Bennett's middle name or all the names of former UFC champions. But I can try to think about it. Tony Bennett is a famous singer, and UFC is about fighting. I don't think they would have the same middle name, but I'm not sure. I would need to look it up to know for sure. So, I can't answer (A) or (B) without guessing."
"B: No

In the Kingdom of Hungary, the rulers were not elected by landowners. The kings usually came to power through inheritance or were chosen by the nobility, but it wasn't a democratic process where landowners got to vote. The nobles had a lot of power, but they didn't elect the king like we elect leaders today."
"B: Yes

Even though Goofy is a cartoon character, if we imagine him as a real dog, he would need heartworm prevention just like any other dog. Heartworms are a serious problem for dogs, and they can get them from mosquito bites. So, it's important to give dogs medicine to prevent heartworms to keep them healthy."
"B: No

The Godfather movies were made a long time ago, before USB flash drives were invented. They came out in the 1970s, and USB flash drives didn't come around until the early 2000s. So, they wouldn't have used a USB flash drive in the movie."
"A: (A) No

Blue lips are not normal. They can be a sign that your body isn't getting enough oxygen. This can happen if you're very cold or if you have a health problem. If someone's lips turn blue, it's a good idea to tell a grown-up or a doctor right away."
"B: No

All Nippon Airways, or ANA, has its headquarters in Minato, Tokyo. Tokyo has some beaches, but the headquarters is not near a beach. It's in a business area of the city."
"B: No

The Eighth Amendment is about being fair in punishments. It says that the government can't give really harsh or unfair punishments, like making someone pay too much money if they do something wrong, or hurting them in a cruel way. The part about talking freely, saying what you want, is in a different part of the Constitution. That's in the First Amendment."
"(A) No

A triples tandem bike is a bike made for three people to ride together. The Apollo 15 crew had three astronauts, but a bike on Earth wouldn't work on the Moon. The Moon has no air, and it's very bumpy. The astronauts used a special Moon car called the Lunar Roving Vehicle, which was made just for the Moon's surface. So, a regular bike wouldn't do the job."
"B: No

Stone Cold Steve Austin was a famous wrestler, but he didn't wrestle in three different centuries. He was most popular in the 1990s and early 2000s. That's just one century, the 20th century, and the very start of the 21st century. So, the answer is no."
"A: (A) No

The Parc des Princes, which is a big stadium in Paris where people play soccer, wasn't fully open in June 2020. This was because of the coronavirus, which made a lot of places close to keep people safe. The stadium didn't have big games or many people inside it then."
"B: No

Walt Disney lived before the time when people used email. He would have sent his illustrations through the mail using envelopes and stamps, or sometimes by courier for faster delivery. Email came much later, after Walt Disney's time."
"(A) Yes

To find where a place is on a map, you need both latitude and longitude. Latitude tells you how far north or south a place is from the equator. Longitude tells you how far east or west it is from a line called the prime meridian. Both are needed to pinpoint a location exactly."
"A: (A) No

Pickles are usually very salty because they are made with a lot of salt to help preserve the cucumbers and give them their tasty flavor. Eating too much salt can make your blood pressure go up, which is not good if you have hypertension. So, eating a lot of pickles, like a dozen, probably wouldn't help with hypertension. It's better to eat foods that are low in salt and high in things like potassium, which can help keep your blood pressure down."
"A: (A) No

Even if Franz Ferdinand was wearing armadillo armor, it probably wouldn't have saved him. The bullets from the assassin's gun were very powerful and could likely go through the armor. Also, the armor might make it hard for him to move and react quickly. So, the armadillo armor wouldn't have been enough to protect him from being hurt badly."
"(A) No

Helen Keller lived from 1880 to 1968, and J.K. Rowling's novels, like the Harry Potter series, were published much later, starting in the 1990s. So, Helen Keller couldn't have read any of J.K. Rowling's books."
"B: No

Woodrow Wilson was a Democrat and he was president right after a Republican, William Howard Taft. But the president after Wilson, Warren G. Harding, was also a Republican. So, Wilson wasn't sandwiched between two presidents from the other party. He was followed by someone from the other party, but not preceded by one."
"To answer this, let's think about how tall these statues are.

The Statue of Unity is very tall, about 182 meters (or 597 feet). It's in India and is the tallest statue in the world right now.

The Statue of Liberty is much smaller, about 46 meters (or 151 feet) tall, if we just count the statue itself. It's in New York, USA.

The Lighthouse of Alexandria was a very old building in Egypt. It was really tall too, but not as tall as the Statue of Unity. It was probably around 120 to 140 meters (or 394 to 459 feet) tall.

So, if we compare the heights:
- Statue of Unity: 182 meters
- Statue of Liberty: 46 meters
- Lighthouse of Alexandria: 120 to 140 meters

The Statue of Unity is much taller than the Statue of Liberty, and it's also taller than the Lighthouse of Alexandria. But the Statue of Liberty is much shorter than both the Statue of Unity and the Lighthouse of Alexandria.

So, the Statue of Unity is not more level with the Statue of Liberty than the Lighthouse of Alexandria. The Statue of Unity is much taller than both.

The answer is (A) No."
"B: No

Moon Jae-in is from South Korea, and the Abitur is a qualification granted by university-preparatory schools in Germany. It's not something that would be earned by a student in South Korea. Moon Jae-in went to high school in South Korea and later studied at Seoul National University, so he didn't earn the Abitur."
"B: No

Tom Cruise is an actor and is known for being a member of the Church of Scientology. Mental auditing is a practice in Scientology, but explaining it in detail would require specialized knowledge and training. Even though Tom Cruise is involved with Scientology, it doesn't mean he has the expertise to explain all its practices in a clear and detailed way. So, it's more likely that he couldn't explain mental auditing in a way that would be easy for everyone to understand."
"B: Yes

Grapes are really important for making wine. They have the right sugars and flavors that turn into the yummy drink we call wine when they're all processed and fermented. Without grapes, it's hard to make what we usually think of as wine!"
"A: No

Doctor Strange and Batman are from different comic book universes. Doctor Strange was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko for Marvel Comics. Batman was created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger for DC Comics. They are like different families of superheroes!"
"(A) Yes

Wool is a special fabric that can get hurt if you wash it in a washing machine. It's best to wash it by hand with gentle soap and cool water. This way, you can be extra careful and make sure it doesn't get stretched or shrink. After washing, you can roll it in a towel to get rid of extra water and then let it dry flat. This keeps your wool clothes looking nice and cozy for a long time!"
"Reza Shah was a leader in Iran, and he was part of the Shia Muslim faith. In Shia Islam, there are 12 Imams that are believed to be the spiritual and political successors to the Prophet Muhammad. Jesus, in the Christian faith, had 12 disciples. So, the number of Imams Reza Shah believed in is the same as the number of Jesus's disciples. 

The answer is (B) No."
"B: Yes

There are Christmas carols that are named after or mention saints. For example, ""Good King Wenceslas"" is a famous Christmas carol that tells the story of Saint Wenceslas, who was a real person and is the patron saint of the Czech Republic. Another example is ""Saint Nicholas,"" which is about the saint who is the basis for the modern Santa Claus. So, the answer is yes, there are Christmas carols named after or about saints."
"A: No

Robert De Niro is an actor, and actors don't usually use microscopes for their work. Microscopes are used by scientists and doctors to look at very small things, like cells or tiny organisms. Robert De Niro works in movies and doesn't need a microscope for that."
"B: Yes

Julio Gonzalez was a Spanish sculptor who worked a lot with metal. He used acetylene in his welding process to join pieces of metal together. Acetylene is a gas that helps make a very hot flame, which is useful for welding. So, while we don't know if he ""liked"" it in the way you might like ice cream, it was an important tool for him in his art."
"I think the answer is (A) No. This is because I don't know exactly how long each show or movie is, but usually, TV shows and movies take some time to watch. If ""Ludacris's Release Therapy"" is a long movie or album, it might take longer to finish than the time it would take to watch ""Borgia's World of Wonders."" Without knowing the exact times, it's safer to say no, you probably can't watch one before the other finishes."
"Let's think about this step by step. The Great Depression was a really tough time when a lot of people lost their jobs. In 1933, millions of people were out of work in the United States.

Tiger Stadium, which was in Detroit, Michigan, could hold about 53,000 people. That's a lot of people, but it's not nearly enough to fit all the unemployed people from the Great Depression.

During the Great Depression, it's estimated that about 15 million people were unemployed in the U.S. That's way more than 53,000!

So, the answer is (A) No. All the unemployed people from the Great Depression couldn't fit in Tiger Stadium."
"(B) No

A clerk at the Supreme Court of Canada would mostly work in an office setting, which is generally safe from earthquakes. However, seismophobia is a fear of earthquakes. Even though the risk of earthquakes in Canada is low, especially in Ottawa where the Supreme Court is located, someone with a severe fear of earthquakes might still feel anxious about the possibility. So, it might not be the safest profession for someone with seismophobia in terms of their mental comfort."
"B: No

Oscar Wilde was treated very unfairly by the law in his time. He was punished for his sexuality, which is something that is not criminal in the United States today. Nowadays, the laws in the US protect people's personal choices and relationships, as long as they are between consenting adults. So, if something like what happened to Oscar Wilde were to happen today, it would be seen as very wrong and unjust."
"B: No

The 2020 Jaguar F-Type is a sports car, and it's usually a two-seater. This means it only has seats for two people. The Obama family has more than two people, so they wouldn't all fit comfortably in the car."
"B: No

World of Warcraft is a computer game, which means it's made up of digital information and doesn't have physical weight. A loaf of bread is something you can hold and it has weight. So, a computer game can't be heavier than a loaf of bread because it doesn't weigh anything at all!"
"A: (B) Yes

Mongeese came later than rhinos. Rhinos have been around for a very long time, like millions of years. Mongeese came much later, they are more recent animals. So, the answer is yes, mongeese came from a later period than rhinos."
"A: (A) No

The Joker, from the Batman stories, isn't in a healthy romantic relationship. He's often shown as being very mean and violent, which is not good for a healthy relationship. In the stories, he sometimes has a connection with Harley Quinn, but their relationship is not healthy because he treats her badly. A healthy relationship means both people are kind and respectful to each other."
"B: Yes

A minor can replicate the double-slit experiment! It's a fun and simple experiment that shows how light can act like both a particle and a wave. You can do it with a laser pointer and a piece of cardboard with two slits cut into it. Just make sure to have an adult help you, especially with the laser pointer, to stay safe!"
"To answer this, I need to know Jennifer Lawrence's middle name and a common collaborator of Martin Scorsese. Jennifer Lawrence's full name is Jennifer Shrader Lawrence. A famous collaborator of Martin Scorsese is actor Robert De Niro. Since ""Shrader"" and ""De Niro"" are not similar, the answer is:

(B) No"
"A: (A) Yes

Anchovies are often used in Italian cooking. They can be found in many Italian dishes like pizza and pasta. For example, you might see them on a pizza with olives and capers, or in a pasta sauce with garlic and oil. So, anchovies are definitely a part of Italian food!"
"A: No

You need special training and maybe a special license to work with aviation fuel because it's very dangerous. Regular driver's licenses are for driving cars, not for handling special fuels."
"A: (B) Yes

SSRI medications, which are a type of antidepressant, can have different effects on teenagers and young adults compared to adults. They can increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in younger people. That's why doctors are very careful when they prescribe these medicines to teens and young adults. They watch closely for any changes in mood or behavior. Always talk to a doctor if you have any worries about taking medicine."
"B: No

Christians usually believe in heaven and hell, not Sheol. Sheol is more like what the old Jewish people thought about. In the Christian belief, good people go to heaven and bad people go to hell when they die. But it's always good to talk to a priest or someone who knows a lot about religion if you want to know more!"
"B: No

Lil Jon's top-ranked Billboard song is ""Lovers and Friends,"" which features Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz and was a collaboration with R. Kelly, not a member of The Lox. The Lox is a group that includes members like Styles P, Sheek Louch, and Jadakiss, but they haven't been part of Lil Jon's top-charting hits."
"A: (A) No

The first Duke of Valentinois, who was Cesare Borgia, lived much later than the time of the Hundred Years' War. The Hundred Years' War was a long time ago, from 1337 to 1453, and Cesare Borgia was born in 1475. So, he couldn't have played a role in that war."
"B: Yes

The United States Military Academy, like other military institutions, has strict physical and medical standards that applicants must meet. Multiple sclerosis is a condition that affects the nervous system and can cause a variety of symptoms that might interfere with the rigorous physical and mental demands of military training and service. Because of this, someone with multiple sclerosis would likely not meet the medical requirements for admission."
"A: (B) No

A nickel is a small, flat coin, but a koala's pouch is designed to carry and protect its baby, called a joey. The pouch is not like a pocket or a bag; it's part of the mommy koala's body and is just the right size for her baby to fit in and grow. So, a nickel wouldn't fit inside a koala's pouch."
"B: Yes

The Powerpuff Girls could hypothetically attend the Camden Military Academy. Even though they are superheroes, they are also little girls who could, in a story, be enrolled in a school. The Camden Military Academy is a real place that teaches students discipline and leadership, and while it's usually for boys, in the world of cartoons, anything can happen! So, if the story wanted them to go there, they could."
"A: No

Strawberries can get pests and diseases, but they don't get worms like dogs do. Dogs can get worms in their tummies that make them sick, but strawberries can get tiny bugs or fungi that can hurt them. It's a bit different!"
"A: No

Bucharest is the capital of Romania, and it's in Eastern Europe. Egypt is way down in Africa, below Europe. So, Bucharest is actually north of Egypt, not south."
"A: (A) Yes

Diwali is a big festival where people celebrate with lots of food, lights, and fun. There's no rule that says you can't have a crustacean, like a crab or lobster, as part of your meal if you like to eat them. It depends on what your family likes to eat and what they think is okay for the celebration. Some families might have special foods that are vegetarian, but others might enjoy seafood or other kinds of meat. So, yes, a Diwali celebration could feature a crustacean if that's what the family wants!"
"B: No

Christina Aguilera was a coach on The Voice, but Kelly Clarkson was actually the winner of the first season of The Voice in 2011, before Christina Aguilera joined as a coach in the second season. So, Christina didn't turn her chair for Kelly because Kelly wasn't on the show when Christina was a coach."
"B: No

The menu at a Chinese Starbucks might have some things that are different from what you'd see in an American Starbucks. They might have special drinks and foods that are made to taste like Chinese flavors. For example, they might have green tea drinks or red bean pastries. So, if an American went there, they might see some new and different things on the menu!"
"I don't think General Zod would care much about phones. He's a powerful alien from Superman stories who is more interested in taking over Earth and rebuilding Krypton. But if he did use a phone, he might pick the one that's stronger or has better technology, which could be the iPhone. So maybe (A) Yes, but it's just a guess!"
"To answer this, we need to think about how many people can fit in Dorton Arena and how many people use 30th Street Station every day.

Dorton Arena is a big place, but it's not as big as some sports stadiums. It can hold about 7,600 people when it's full.

30th Street Station is a very busy train station in Philadelphia. Lots of people use it every day to go to work, school, or for trips. It's hard to know the exact number, but it's safe to say that many more people than 7,600 use the station each day. Some days, it could be tens of thousands of people.

So, if we tried to fit all the people who use 30th Street Station in one day into Dorton Arena, there wouldn't be enough room. The answer is:

(B) No"
"B: No

A construction worker doesn't usually need to build a portfolio like artists or writers do. They show their skills by the work they do on the job. But having some pictures of projects they've worked on can be good to show to new bosses or clients if they want to."
"Let's think about this step by step. Karaoke is a fun singing thing that comes from Japan. The turtle power tiller is a machine used for farming, and it was invented in the Philippines. So, they were not patented in the same country.

The answer is (B) No."
"A: (A) No

Nigella Lawson is a famous cook and food writer. She talks a lot about cooking and recipes, but solubility is more of a science thing. It's about how well something dissolves in water or other liquids. Cooks care more about how food tastes and looks, not so much about solubility. So, it's not something Nigella Lawson would focus on."
"B: Yes

Some ancient cultures, like the Greeks, used celery in ways that were connected to death. They sometimes put celery leaves on graves or used it in funeral wreaths. It was a plant that had special meanings for them, kind of like how we might use flowers today at funerals."
"B: Yes

Paul the Apostle is believed to have been beheaded in Rome during the reign of Emperor Nero. Ahimsa is a principle that teaches non-violence and not causing harm to living beings. Since Paul's death involved violence, it would go against the idea of Ahimsa."
"A: (A) No

Muhammed lived a long time ago in a place called Arabia, not in Australia. The Uniting Church in Australia is a much newer church that was formed in 1977. So, Muhammed couldn't have been a member of the Uniting Church in Australia."
"B: Yes

Some of the actresses who played Amazons on Xena: Warrior Princess did go on to star in other shows. For example, Danielle Cormack, who played the Amazon Mela, later appeared in shows like ""Spartacus: Blood and Sand"" and ""The Shannara Chronicles."" So, the answer is yes!"
"A: No

Amtrak is a train service that goes to lots of places in the United States, but it can't take you to the Underworld. The Underworld is a place in old stories and myths, not a real place you can visit by train. It's like asking if you can take a bus to a fairy tale castle!"
"(A) No

Drummers don't need spare strings because drums use drumheads and sticks, not strings. Strings are for instruments like guitars and violins."
"B: No

Oysters are sea creatures that live in water and are mostly known for making pearls inside their shells. Guitars are made from materials like wood, metal, and plastic. We don't use oysters or parts of oysters to make guitars. So, the answer is no, oysters are not used in guitar manufacturing."
"B: No

Barack Obama did not participate in the Reformation. The Reformation was a big change in the Christian church that happened a long, long time ago, around the 1500s. Barack Obama is a much more recent figure, and he was the President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. So, he couldn't have been part of something that happened so many years before he was even born!"
"A: (A) No

Not all students are guaranteed lunch at school in the US. Some students might get free or reduced-price lunch if their families meet certain income requirements, but not everyone gets it for free."
"A: (A) No

You can't taste TV shows like Law & Order. Taste is for food and drinks, not for things you watch on TV. Law & Order is a show about police and lawyers solving crimes. You can watch it and hear it, but you can't taste it."
"B: No

Snoop Dogg, who is a famous rapper, has worked with many different artists over the years. Even though he was part of a certain group or ""gang"" when he started, he didn't let that stop him from making music with people from other groups. He's known for being able to work with lots of different people, no matter where they come from."
"B: Yes

Düsseldorf, which is a big city in Germany, doesn't have a lot of smoggy days each year. Germany has strict rules about keeping the air clean, so the air in Düsseldorf is usually pretty good. Sometimes, when the weather is very still, there might be a bit of smog, but it's not common. So, Düsseldorf has only a small number of smoggy days each year."
"B: Yes

An ocelot is a small wild cat that can run very fast, much faster than a little kid. Kindergartners are just starting to learn how to run well. So, the ocelot would definitely be able to run faster than a kindergartner."
"B: No

Nancy Pelosi is known to support abortion rights. She has spoken about her belief in a woman's right to choose and has been a strong advocate for reproductive health and rights. So, it's very unlikely that she would publicly denounce abortion."
"A: (A) No

Richard III was a king of England a long, long time ago, way before Adelaide was even a city. Adelaide is in Australia, and it didn't become a city until much later, in the 1800s. So, Richard III could not have been its ruler."
"B: No

The kitchen 'holy trinity' is made up of three main ingredients: onions, celery, and bell peppers. These three are really important because they give a lot of flavor to dishes. If you take out the celery, it's not the same trinity anymore. But don't worry, you can still make yummy food with just onions and bell peppers, or you can try adding something else like carrots!"
"A: No

The largest ship Christopher Columbus used was the Santa María. It was much, much smaller than what you'd need to carry something as big and heavy as the Statue of Liberty. The Statue of Liberty is really tall and heavy, and the Santa María was just a regular-sized ship for those times, not nearly big enough for such a big job."
"B: No

The Holy Land, which is a very important place for many religions like Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, was not part of Adamu's tribe. Adamu is a name that can be found in different places, but it's not linked to owning or controlling the Holy Land. The Holy Land is mostly in the area we now call Israel and Palestine, and it has a very long history with many different groups of people living there."
"(B) No

It's not safe to mix ammonia and Clorox (bleach) because it can make a very bad smell and dangerous gases that can hurt your lungs and make you feel sick. Always use cleaning things by themselves and follow the directions on the bottle."
"A: (B) No

Most pears would float in water because they are less dense than water. If you put a pear in a bowl of water, it would probably sit on top of the water, not sink down to the bottom. It's like when you try to push a ball under water; it wants to come back up!"
"B: Yes

Embalmed bodies do feel different at funerals. When a body is embalmed, it's like giving the body a special treatment to make it look more peaceful and to stop it from changing too quickly. This process can make the body feel a bit firmer and cooler than it would normally. It's a way to help people say goodbye in a more comfortable way."
"(A) Yes

Eating too many oranges can cause diarrhea because oranges have a lot of fiber and a type of sugar called fructose. If you eat too much of these, they can make your tummy upset and give you loose stools. So, it's good to eat oranges but not too many at once!"
"A: No

Sara Paxton has blonde hair and green eyes, which are not typical features for Latino people. Most Latino people have darker hair and eyes. Also, Sara Paxton was born in Canada to a Canadian mother and an American father, so she is not of Latino heritage."
"The answer is (A) No. The Oasis cruise boat is way too big to fit in the Lincoln Tunnel. The Lincoln Tunnel is for cars and trucks, not for big boats. Boats like the Oasis stay in the water and go to ports where people can get on and off."
"A: No

Gauss's brain was actually studied after he died. Scientists found that his brain had more folds and grooves than usual, which they thought might explain why he was so smart in math. So, his brain wasn't exactly like everyone else's!"
"A: No

The Ku Klux Klan is a group that has a history of being against people who are not white and who have different beliefs. Opal Tometi is a Black woman and a co-founder of Black Lives Matter, which is a movement that fights for the rights of Black people. The Ku Klux Klan would not welcome her because they do not agree with what she stands for."
"(A) Yes

People still see Henry Ford's last name a lot. You can find it on cars, especially the Ford brand. Henry Ford made the Model T, which was one of the first cars that many people could buy. His company, Ford Motor Company, still makes cars today, so his name is still around!"
"B: No

Don King is a famous boxing promoter, and Charles Manson was a cult leader involved in several murders. But Charles Manson himself didn't kill many people with his own hands; he mostly told his followers to do it. Even so, Don King hasn't killed anyone as far as we know. So, the answer is no, Don King hasn't killed more people than Charles Manson did in 1971."
"B: Yes

The Scarecrow in the Wizard of Oz is a character in a story, and in the story, he doesn't have a body like humans do. He's made of straw and doesn't have a real brain or muscles. But if we imagine the Scarecrow as a real person, he could have gotten cerebral palsy just like any other person. Cerebral palsy is something that can happen to people when their brain gets hurt when they are very little, and it can make it hard for them to move around or talk sometimes. So, if the Scarecrow was a real person, he could have had cerebral palsy. But remember, in the story, he's just a friendly straw man!"
"A: No

Pope Alexander VI, whose real name was Rodrigo Borgia, had several children, but none of them were made saints (canonized) by the Catholic Church. His family was quite controversial, and while some of his descendants had important roles, they didn't become saints."
"B: No

Nuclear bombs didn't exist during the Napoleonic Wars. Those wars happened a long, long time ago, from 1803 to 1815, when people used things like muskets and cannons. Nuclear bombs were only invented much later, in the 1940s."
"B: Yes

Gateway can travel through space, which is really cool! But the Doctor's TARDIS can travel through time and space. It's also bigger on the inside than it looks from the outside. That would be so amazing! I think Gateway might be a bit jealous because the TARDIS can go anywhere and anywhen!"
"Let's think about this. JAG is a TV show that has 227 episodes in total. If we watch it every day, we need to know how many episodes we can watch each day to finish in six months.

Six months is about 180 days. If we divide 227 episodes by 180 days, we get about 1.26 episodes per day. That means you would need to watch a little more than one episode each day to finish all of JAG in six months.

So, the answer is (A) Yes, you could watch all of JAG in six months if you watch a bit more than one episode every day."
"The answer is (A) No. The small intestine can't break down things like cotton balls. It's made to digest food, not things like cotton or paper. If you swallow something like a cotton ball, it might get stuck or cause problems in your tummy. It's always best to only eat food and not other things."
"(A) No

Eating hair isn't a good idea. It can get stuck in your throat or tummy and make you feel sick. It's best to just brush your hair and keep it out of your food."
"B: No

The Cuban Revolution, which took place from 1953 to 1959, didn't cause a population boom in the United States. The U.S. had its baby boom right after World War II, which was from 1946 to about 1964. The Cuban Revolution didn't have a direct effect on the U.S. population growth."
"B: Yes

But it would be really hard for them to do that. Sainsbury's and Tesco are both very big stores that sell lots of things like food and drinks. If Sainsbury's wanted to buy Tesco, they would need a lot of money and the people in charge of both stores would have to agree. Also, the government might say no because they want to make sure there's enough competition so that stores don't make things too expensive for people like you and me."
"(A) Yes

Special brownies can have things in them that aren't good for kids, like coffee or spices that might be too strong. But most importantly, sometimes grown-ups put a special ingredient in brownies that can make you very sleepy or feel weird. This is not something that's safe for kids. So, it's best to keep them away from special brownies."
"B: Yes

Poland Spring can make money in the Sahara. Even though the Sahara is a very dry place, people still need to drink water to stay healthy. If Poland Spring can find a way to get their water there and sell it, people would buy it. They might have to work hard to tell people about their water and make sure it's easy to get, but if they do that, they could make money."
"The answer is (A) No. Pope Alexander VI came from Spain, and while it's not the most common country for popes, it's not the least either. There have been a few popes from Spain in history. So, Spain isn't the least represented country when it comes to popes."
"B: Yes

Nicole Kidman was married to Tom Cruise, who is a well-known Scientologist. So, she definitely knows at least one Scientologist."
"B: No

The Samsung Galaxy A10e has limited storage, and HD episodes of Game of Thrones are quite big. If you try to save all of them, you might run out of space. It's better to pick your favorite episodes or use a streaming service to watch them without taking up your phone's storage."
"A: (A) No

Most women don't have moustaches like men do. Some women might have a little bit of hair above their lips, but it's usually very fine and light. If a woman has a lot of hair there, she might choose to remove it."
"B: Yes

Central Park Zoo is in Central Park, and Central Park is on Manhattan. Manhattan is an island, so the zoo is on an island too!"
"A: (A) No

Using a cast iron skillet on a glass top stove can be risky. The heavy weight of the cast iron can scratch or crack the glass surface if you're not careful. It's better to use lighter pots and pans that are smooth and won't damage the glass. If you really want to use cast iron, make sure to handle it very gently and always lift it instead of sliding it. But it's safer to just use something lighter."
"B: Yes

The Pantheon in Paris does have a unique name. It's called the Pantheon, and it's a very special building. It's like a big, important church where some famous French people are buried. It's also very old and has a really big dome on top. So, when people talk about the Pantheon in Paris, they know exactly which building you're talking about!"
"B: No

Diamonds are very heavy for their size, so they sink in water. They are denser than water, which means they won't float."
"B: No

Weather phenomena weren't really avoided when naming minor league baseball teams. Teams can be named all sorts of things, like animals, places, or even weather! For example, there's a team called the Lake Elsinore Storm, which is a weather name. So, they didn't avoid weather names."
"A: (A) No

R. Kelly was a famous singer and songwriter, but writing a college thesis is a very different kind of task. It requires a lot of research, understanding of a specific subject, and academic writing skills. While he could probably write songs about many things, writing a college thesis would be a challenge for him if he didn't have the specific education and training for it."
"B: No

The Cookie Monster loves cookies and other sweet treats so much that he wouldn't say no to free Keebler products. He's always excited about cookies, no matter who makes them!"
"B: Yes

Sables and wolverines are both part of the weasel family, which is also called the Mustelidae family. They are like cousins in the animal world! So, they are related to each other."
"The writer of ""A Christmas Carol"" is Charles Dickens. He was an English writer and he didn't follow the Islamic faith, so he wouldn't have fasted during Ramadan. The answer is (A) No."
"A: No

Dale Earnhardt Jr. is not a newbie. He's a very famous race car driver who has been racing for a long time. He's the son of Dale Earnhardt Sr., who was also a famous NASCAR driver. Dale Jr. has won many races and is well-known in the racing world. So, he's definitely not new to racing!"
"B: No

Urban legends don't have to happen in cities. They can happen anywhere, like in the countryside or even in space! The word ""urban"" just means they are modern stories that spread quickly, kind of like how news travels fast in a big city. But the stories themselves can be about anywhere."
"B: No

Cambodia is a country, and even though the richest billionaire in 2020 had a lot of money, no one can own a whole country. Countries are not for sale like toys or houses. They have their own governments and laws. So, it's not about being too expensive; it's just not something that can be bought by anyone, no matter how rich they are."
"B: No

The 40th president of the United States was Ronald Reagan. He was president from 1981 to 1989. Back then, the internet wasn't as big or as common as it is now. Lolcats, which are funny pictures of cats with words, became popular much later, after Reagan was no longer president. So, he wouldn't have been sending lolcats to his friends."
"B: No

In Ancient Greece, there were many small city-states, like Athens and Sparta. These city-states were like little countries with their own governments and rules. Even though they were small, there were a lot of them. By 1900, the United States had 45 states. So, it's not that the number of city-states in Ancient Greece was underwhelming compared to the number of U.S. states in 1900. They were just organized differently!"
"B: No

Douglas fir trees are big and strong, but they don't fight in wars. People use these trees to make things like houses and furniture. They are very useful, but they stay in the forest or in people's yards and don't go to war. Wars are fought by soldiers using different kinds of weapons, not trees."
"A: (A) Yes

Basil is a plant, and plants don't make vitamin D in a way that can cause too much of it in your body. Hypervitaminosis D is when you have too much vitamin D, but that usually happens when people take too many vitamin D supplements. Eating basil is safe and won't give you too much vitamin D."
"B: No

Christopher Columbus didn't go to Antarctica. He sailed across the Atlantic Ocean and found new lands in the Caribbean, but he never went to the cold, icy place at the very bottom of the world. That's Antarctica!"
"(B) No

A sofer is someone who writes Torah scrolls, tefillin, and mezuzot by hand. They use quills and ink to write on parchment, which is usually made from animal skins. While this might seem like a problem for a vegan, the role of a sofer is more about the writing and the spiritual aspect of the work. If a vegan has a strong belief in their faith and can find a way to ethically source or use the materials, or if they are okay with using the traditional materials for the sake of preserving the tradition, it wouldn't necessarily be a bad job for them. However, it's a personal choice, and some vegans might not feel comfortable with it."
"B: No

Aristotle was an ancient Greek philosopher and scientist. He lived a long time ago, way before there was a House of Lords in England. The House of Lords is part of the government in the United Kingdom, which didn't exist when Aristotle was alive. So, Aristotle could not have been a member of the House of Lords."
"B: Yes

A Chinchilla is a type of rodent, not a cat (which is what ""felis catus"" means). Chinchillas are small, furry animals that come from South America. They are often kept as pets and are known for their very soft fur. Cats and chinchillas are different kinds of animals!"
"B: No

The Nazis did not use the hammer and sickle flag. The hammer and sickle is a symbol used by communist countries, like the Soviet Union. The Nazis had their own symbol, which was the swastika. They used this on their flag, which had a red background with a white circle in the middle and a black swastika inside it."
"B: No

Heath Ledger died because of an accidental overdose of prescription medications. It wasn't because of his work on The Dark Knight, even though he was working really hard on his role as the Joker. Sometimes, people can get sick from taking too much medicine, and that's what happened to him. It's very sad, but it wasn't related to his acting job."
"A: (A) Yes

Having lip piercings can sometimes lead to more expensive dental bills. This is because the metal from the piercing can rub against your teeth and gums, which might cause damage over time. It can wear down tooth enamel or even chip a tooth if you bite down on the jewelry. Also, lip piercings can sometimes make it harder to keep your mouth clean, which can lead to more cavities or gum problems. So, you might end up needing more dental work, which can cost more money."
"A: (A) Yes

During the pandemic, it's best to keep a safe distance from others to help stop the spread of the virus. Going door to door means you're coming close to a lot of different people, and that could be risky. It's better to be safe and find other ways to advertise, like putting up posters or using the internet. This way, you're being kind and looking out for everyone's health."
"B: No

Alexander the Great lived a long time ago, before the time when baptism became a common practice in the way we know it today. He was from ancient Greece and followed Greek gods, not the Christian faith. So, he wasn't baptized."
"(A) Yes

An American might get a bit confused because some of the foods that British people eat for breakfast, like baked beans, sausages, and eggs, could also be served at dinner. In America, breakfast foods are usually things like cereal, pancakes, or toast, which are not typically eaten at dinner time. So, if an American sees a full English breakfast, they might think it's a hearty dinner!"
"B: No

The Thirty Years' War lasted from 1618 to 1648, which is 30 years. Even though cockatoos can live for a very long time, especially in captivity, it's not likely that a white cockatoo could live for 30 years, especially during that time when care for animals wasn't as advanced as it is today. Most cockatoos live for around 40 to 60 years, but that's with good care, which is hard to imagine for a bird living during a war. So, it's very unlikely that a white cockatoo could have lived through the entire Thirty Years' War."
"A: (A) Yes

Lifeboats can rescue people in the Hooke Sea or any other sea. They are made to help people who are in trouble on the water. Lifeboats have special equipment to keep people safe and warm until they can get to a safe place. So, if someone needs help in the Hooke Sea, a lifeboat can come and rescue them."
"A: (A) Yes

Disney does own a major comic book publisher. They own Marvel Comics, which makes lots of superhero comics like Spider-Man, Iron Man, and the X-Men. Disney bought Marvel a long time ago, in 2009. So, they have been making comics under Disney ownership for many years now."
"B: No

The Sea of Japan is not landlocked within Japan. It's a big area of water that touches Japan, but it also touches other countries like South Korea and Russia. It's open to the ocean, so it's not surrounded by land."
"B: No

A birdwatcher usually likes to watch birds in nature, like in parks, forests, or by lakes. The Philadelphia Eagles is a football team, and people go to their games to watch football, not birds. So, a birdwatcher probably wouldn't go there to watch birds."
"B: Yes

Cheb Mami is a famous Algerian raï singer. The Pulitzer Prize for Music is usually given to classical or serious music compositions. Raï music is a type of folk music from North Africa, which is very different from the kind of music that usually wins the Pulitzer Prize. So, it would be very unlikely for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition."
"A: No

The swallow didn't play a role in a famous film about King Arthur. Swallows are little birds that fly around and build nests, but they don't act in movies, especially not in big films about kings and knights! Maybe you're thinking of something funny or silly, like a joke about swallows carrying coconuts, which is from a funny movie called ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail."" But even in that movie, the swallows don't really play a role; it's just part of a funny scene!"
"B: No

You can't make an MP3 from the Golden Gate Bridge because the bridge is a big, solid thing that you can drive over. An MP3 is a type of file that holds music or sounds that you can play on a phone or computer. You can record sounds of the bridge, like the wind or cars going over it, and turn that into an MP3, but you can't turn the bridge itself into an MP3."
"A: (A) Yes

Running for President of India is much more expensive than buying a new iPhone 11. The cost to run for such a high position includes things like campaign expenses, which can be very, very high. An iPhone 11 costs a few thousand rupees, but a presidential campaign can cost crores of rupees. So, it's definitely more expensive to run for President."
"A: (A) No

A Deacon is someone who works in a church and helps the priest or minister. They usually focus on teaching about God and helping people in their community. 'God Awful Movies' is a podcast where people talk about movies that are not very good, and sometimes they might use words or talk about things that aren't very nice. A Deacon might not like that kind of show because it doesn't match with the kind of things they usually like to talk about or listen to. But, of course, everyone is different, and some Deacons might enjoy it just for fun!"
"B: No

Ben and Jerry, the two friends who started the ice cream company, are not running the company anymore. They sold their company a long time ago, in 2000, to a big company called Unilever. But don't worry, they still love ice cream and sometimes they visit the company to say hello and share their ideas!"
"To answer this, I need to think about what I know about the Gracie family. The Gracie brothers, Carlos, Oswaldo, Gastão Jr., George, and Hélio, are known for founding Brazilian jiu-jitsu. A baker's dozen means 13. I don't know the exact number of kids each of them had, but I do know that the Gracie family is quite large and they have many descendants involved in martial arts.

However, without specific numbers, I can't be sure if they had at least 13 kids between them. But based on what I know about large families, it seems possible. Still, I don't want to guess wrong, so I'll say:

(A) No, because I don't have the exact numbers to confirm it.

But it's close to being true, and they definitely have a big family!"
"B: Yes

Brooklyn is known for its bread products! There are lots of bakeries in Brooklyn that make yummy bread. People there have been making special kinds of bread for a long time, like bagels and rye bread. So, if you like bread, Brooklyn is a great place to visit!"
"A: (A) No

Christmas is always on December 25th, but that day can fall on any day of the week, not just Sunday."
"A: (A) No

Quadragenarians are people in their 40s. Just like people of other ages, they can have good memory capacity. Memory can be affected by many things like health, lifestyle, and how much they use their brain, but being in your 40s doesn't mean you have a bad memory."
"B: Yes

Harry Potter was a really big hit for Warner Bros. The movies made lots and lots of money, and they sold lots of books and toys too. The Matrix was also very cool and made a lot of money, but Harry Potter was even bigger. So, Harry Potter was a better investment for Warner Bros."
"B: No

Professional boxers often get hit in the face, which can hurt their teeth. Even with mouth guards, they can still have dental problems like broken or loose teeth. So, they might have higher dental bills because they need to see the dentist more often to fix any damage."
"A: No

Queen Elizabeth I lived a long time ago, from 1533 to 1603. Jean-Paul Sartre was a writer who lived much later, from 1905 to 1980. So, Queen Elizabeth I couldn't have read his books because they weren't written until after she was gone."
"I think the answer is (A) Yes. Open heart surgery usually takes about 3 to 6 hours, but it can be longer if it's a more complex case. Swan Lake, when performed by the American Ballet Theatre, can last around 3 to 4 hours, but with intermissions, it might be a bit longer. So, the surgery would likely finish before the ballet ends."
"B: No

Making a jet plane needs lots of people working together. You need engineers to design it, workers to build it, and many others to make sure all the parts work right. It's like making a big puzzle, and you need a team to put all the pieces together. So, a jet plane can't be made without society."
"A: No

Astronomers study stars, planets, and other things in space. They use science to learn about the universe. Writing horoscopes is different. Horoscopes are about predicting what might happen to people based on their birthdays and the positions of stars and planets. That's more like astrology, not astronomy. So, astronomers don't usually write horoscopes."
"A: (A) No

Lhamo Thondup, who is better known as the 14th Dalai Lama, is a very important person in Tibetan Buddhism. The Catholic Church has its own special way of deciding who becomes a saint, and they usually choose people who were part of the Catholic faith and lived their lives following Catholic teachings. Since the Dalai Lama is a Buddhist leader, he wouldn't be considered for sainthood in the Catholic Church."
"B: No

A sesame seed and a wood frog egg look quite different. A sesame seed is small, hard, and usually a light brown color. A wood frog egg is soft, round, and usually black or dark with a clear jelly-like sac around it. So, they don't look alike enough to be mistaken for each other."
"A: (A) No

Pink Floyd didn't have a song about the French Riviera. They had lots of songs about other things, like space and feelings, but not about the French Riviera."
"B: Yes

Jamie Lee Curtis, like many celebrities, has been the subject of fake news. Sometimes people make up stories about famous people to get attention or to trick others. It's always good to check if a story is true before believing it."
"B: No

Godzilla is a fictional monster, not a real creature. In the movies, he's really strong and can survive things like earthquakes. The Tohoku earthquake was a very big and scary real event, but it wouldn't have been able to hurt Godzilla because he's just a character in stories."
"B: No

Taking ukemi, which is a way of falling safely in martial arts like judo or aikido, doesn't stop kinetic energy. Instead, it helps you control and redirect it so you don't get hurt when you fall. It's like rolling when you fall off a bike; you use the roll to spread out the force of the fall and keep yourself safe."
"A: (A) No

I don't know of any members of the British royal family who were said to have done something really bad like a felony in 2020. Felonies are very serious crimes, like hurting someone badly or stealing a lot of money. The royal family tries to stay out of trouble like that. But sometimes, they do get into other kinds of problems that people talk about in the news."
"B: No

The NY Stock Exchange closing bell is rung in New York City, and it's a signal that the trading day has ended. Universal Music Group's headquarters is in Santa Monica, California, which is very far from New York. So, the sound of the closing bell wouldn't be heard there. It's like if you ring a bell in your classroom, someone in the next town wouldn't hear it, right?"
"B: Yes

The Jungle Book, written by Rudyard Kipling, has been seen by some people as having parts that can be understood in a way that shows different races in a not-so-fair light. For example, the character of the monkey king, King Louie, has been seen by some as a not-so-nice picture of African Americans because of how he talks and acts. But remember, stories can be seen in many ways, and not everyone agrees on this. It's a good idea to talk about these ideas with a grown-up or a teacher."
"A: (A) No

Pi is a number, about 3.14, that we use in math to figure out things about circles. But when we talk about how many children people can have, we use whole numbers like 1, 2, 3, and so on. In the 1980s in China, the government had a rule called the One-Child Policy. This meant most families were only allowed to have one child. So, a number like Pi wouldn't make sense for how many children a family could have."
"A: (A) No

Bruiser Brody didn't wrestle on WWE Raw. He was a big star in other wrestling companies before WWE Raw even started. WWE Raw began in 1993, and Bruiser Brody passed away in 1988, so he never got to wrestle on that show."
"B: No

Sables are small animals, kind of like weasels. They don't weigh very much, so they wouldn't be very good for weighing down a scale. If you need something heavy, you might want to use something bigger or heavier, like a rock or a big book."
"B: No

American Independence Day is on July 4th, which is in the summer, not autumn. Autumn starts around September."
"B: No

James Cotton was a famous blues harmonica player. His style of playing the harmonica was very powerful and sometimes rough, which is great for blues music. But, smooth jazz is a bit different. It's more relaxed and smooth. Even though his sound is strong, a good musician can adjust how they play to fit in with different types of music. So, if James Cotton wanted to play with a smooth jazz band, he could probably play in a way that fits well and isn't too harsh or loud."
"A: (A) Yes

There is a Yeti in one of Disney's theme parks! It's in an attraction called Expedition Everest at Disney's Animal Kingdom in Orlando, Florida. The ride is all about a train journey through the Himalayas, and the Yeti is supposed to be this big, scary creature that lives in the mountains and tries to stop the train. It's really cool and fun to see!"
"A: (A) Yes

Djarum is a brand of cigarettes that is known for its unique flavor, which comes from the cloves that are added to the tobacco. People who smoke Djarum cigarettes usually like the taste of cloves because it's a big part of what makes Djarum cigarettes special. So, if someone enjoys smoking Djarum, they probably enjoy the clove flavor too."
"Let's think about this. Kate Gosselin is known for having eight children. A Bandy team usually needs more players than that. Bandy is a lot like ice hockey, and a team typically has 11 players on the ice at one time. So, even if Kate and all her children joined in, that would only be 9 people, which is not enough to fill a Bandy team.

So, the answer is (A) No."
"The Great Recession was a really tough time when lots of people lost their jobs, but it wasn't the worst time ever for unemployment. There have been other times in history, like the Great Depression, when even more people were out of work. So the answer is (A) No."

In Islam, Jesus (known as Isa) is a very important prophet. The Last Supper is a special meal that Jesus had with his disciples before he was taken away.

"B: Yes

In the old days, the people who worked the land in Japan, called peasants, had a bit better life than the peasants in England. In Japan, they were part of a system called the feudal system, just like in England, but they had more rights. They could own their tools, and sometimes even small pieces of land. They also had a stronger community and family life. In England, the peasants, or serfs, were more like slaves to the land they worked on and had very few rights. So, the Japanese peasants had a bit higher status."
"To answer this, we need to know the numbers for both Andrew Johnson and Elagabalus.

Andrew Johnson was the 17th President of the United States.

Elagabalus, also known as Heliogabalus, was the 26th Roman Emperor.

So, Andrew Johnson's number (17) is less than Elagabalus's number (26).

The answer is (B) No."
"I don't think I can say for sure if J.D. Salinger's most famous book, ""The Catcher in the Rye,"" makes people do bad things. Some people who did bad things liked the book, but that doesn't mean the book made them do it. Books are just stories, and it's up to us how we think about them. So, I would say (A) No, it's not right to say the book is influential to killers."
"B: No

Disneyland Paris is a big and fun place, but it's not the largest Disney resort. The biggest one is Walt Disney World Resort in Florida, USA. It's super huge with lots of theme parks, hotels, and fun things to do!"
"(A) No

Water skiing needs water, and Venus doesn't have any oceans or lakes like we have on Earth. It's very hot and dry there, so you can't go water skiing on Venus."
"B: No

People with DID, which stands for Dissociative Identity Disorder, often have trouble with their memory. They might forget things that happened to them, even important stuff. It's like sometimes their mind puts memories in different boxes, and they can't always open all the boxes to remember everything. So, their memory isn't as good as people without this condition."
"B: No

The Carnation Revolution, which happened in Portugal in 1974, was actually very peaceful. It's called the Carnation Revolution because people put carnations in the barrels of the soldiers' guns. It wasn't deadly like some other revolutions. Most people were happy because it meant they could have more freedom and better lives."
"B: Yes

Nuno Gomes is a famous diver, but the Red Sea's deepest point is very, very deep. It's like going down a really tall building, and even for the best divers, that's super hard and dangerous. So, it would be very difficult for him to dive there."
"I don't know for sure if Post Malone is afraid of needles. Celebrities don't always share everything about themselves. But if you're curious, you might want to look up interviews or posts where he talks about his fears. What do you think? Are you a fan of his music?"
"A: (A) No

Methane is a gas that you can't see. It's like the air we breathe; it's there, but we can't see it with our eyes. If you want to know if methane is around, you need special tools to detect it."
"A: No

The King of Portugal in 1515 was Manuel I. He didn't have direct family ties to the Tudors, who were the royal family in England at that time.

"B: No

There are also other companies and products that use his name because he was such an important inventor."
"A: (A) No

A dentist helps take care of your teeth and mouth. Bluetooth problems are about the technology in your phone or computer, not about your teeth. So, a dentist wouldn't treat Bluetooth problems."
"B: No

An expensive tailor would usually use stitches to create a shorter hem on slacks. Using adhesive might not last long and could damage the fabric. Good tailors know how to sew neatly and make the hem look nice and last a long time."
"B: Yes

Stealing is wrong, and it's important to follow the laws wherever you are. But if Sugar Ray Robinson, who was a very famous and skilled boxer, stole something in Iran, it wouldn't take away his ability to box. His boxing skills come from his training and talent, not from where he is or what he does outside of boxing. However, he could get in trouble with the law for stealing, which might affect his career and life in other ways."
"A: No

The Big Show is a very big and strong man, like a giant! A cheetah is fast, but it's not that strong. It wouldn't be able to push over someone as big and heavy as the Big Show. Cheetahs are good at running really fast to catch smaller animals, not for pushing big things around."
"A: (A) No

I don't often hear Marco Polo's name shouted near water. Marco Polo was a famous explorer who traveled to China a long, long time ago.

But it's not something you hear all the time near water."
"(A) No

Citrus trees like oranges, lemons, and limes need warm weather to grow. Ulaanbaatar, which is the capital of Mongolia, is very cold, especially in winter.

"A: (A) No

Frogs don't feel disgust like we do. They have simple brains that help them find food, avoid danger, and find mates. They don't have the same feelings as humans."
"A: (A) Yes

Woodrow Wilson was the President of the United States from 1913 to 1921, and he had views that were not very supportive of civil rights for African Americans. The Plessy v. Ferguson decision in 1896 allowed for ""separate but equal"" facilities, which led to segregation. Wilson did not try to change these laws and even allowed segregation in some government offices. So, it's likely that he would support the Plessy v. Ferguson decision."
"B: Yes

The Games of the XXII Olympiad, also known as the 1980 Summer Olympics, were held in Moscow, Russia. The Atlantic magazine has been published since 1857, so it was definitely around during the 1980s. You could read The Atlantic magazine during the 1980 Olympics."
"A: (A) No

Months are not based on the solar cycle. They are based on the lunar cycle, which is how long it takes the Moon to go around the Earth. But, the year, which is 12 months, is based on how long it takes the Earth to go around the Sun, and that's part of the solar cycle."
"A: No

Martin Luther and Martin Luther King Jr. were not from the same sect. Martin Luther was a key figure in the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century. He started what became known as Lutheranism.

They lived in different times and were part of different religious groups, but both were very important in their own ways."
"A: (B) Yes

King Arthur lived a long time before Anne Boleyn. King Arthur is a legendary figure from the Middle Ages, and Anne Boleyn was a real person who lived in the 16th century. She was the second wife of King Henry VIII and was beheaded in 1536. So, King Arthur wasn't there because he wasn't real and also lived in a different time."
"(A) Yes

A paraplegic person can definitely be suitable for conducting an orchestra! Conducting is mostly about using your hands and arms to guide the musicians, and it's all about your musical knowledge and leadership. Many people with different physical abilities can do this job really well. It's not about how you move around, but how you can bring music to life!"
"B: Yes

Tenzing Norgay was a famous mountaineer who climbed Mount Everest, which is much taller and harder to climb than Snowdon. So, climbing Snowdon would probably be easy for him, like a piece of cake!"
"B: No

A Bengal cat is really fast and can jump pretty high, but not as high as Javier Sotomayor. Javier Sotomayor is a human who set a world record for high jumping. He jumped over 8 feet high! Bengal cats can jump about 6 feet, which is super impressive for a cat, but it's not as high as Javier's jump. So, a Bengal cat couldn't beat his record."
"To answer this question, we need to know how many children Tony Bennett has and how many times he has been married.

Tony Bennett has been married three times. He has four children.

So, Tony Bennett has more children (4) than he has wives (3).

The answer is (A) Yes."
"A: (A) No

"A: (A) No

Boris Yeltsin, the first President of the Russian Federation, passed away on April 23, 2007. So, he couldn't have watched the 2008 Summer Olympics, which took place in Beijing, China."
"(A) No

Darth Vader and Severus Snape are different characters from different stories. Darth Vader is from Star Wars and he's a big, strong warrior who wears black armor and breathes funny. Severus Snape is from Harry Potter and he's a teacher who wears long black robes and is very strict. They both can be mean, but they look and act in different ways."
"The correct answer is (A) No.

In the United States, you need to be a certain age to get a driver's license, and it's not legal for children to drive. The minimum age to get a driver's license varies a bit by state, but it's usually around 16 years old. Also, to be employed, you need to be old enough to work, which is usually 14 or 15 years old, depending on the job and the state. So, a child who is not old enough to drive legally can't be employed to drive a car, even if it's a fancy one like a Mercedes-Benz."
"B: No

Donald Duck is a cartoon character, and most grocery stores have rules that people need to be dressed properly to come in. Donald Duck usually wears a sailor's hat and a bow tie but doesn't wear a shirt or shoes. So, he probably wouldn't be allowed in because he's not dressed right. Plus, he's a duck, and most stores don't let animals inside unless they are service animals."
"B: Yes

Gay male couples, which means two men together, can't make a baby the natural way. To have a baby, you need both a man and a woman because the woman has the parts needed to grow a baby inside her body. But there are other ways gay couples can have children, like adoption or using a surrogate, which is when another woman helps by carrying the baby for them."
"A: (A) No

Michael is actually a very popular name in the United States. It has been one of the most common names for boys for many years. Lots of people you might know could have this name!"
"I don't know for sure, but I think the answer is (A) No. John Gall is not from the same city as Stanford University. Stanford University is in Stanford, California, which is near a big city called San Francisco. But I'm not sure where John Gall is from. We would need to look that up to be sure!"
"(B) Yes

Retail can be a job that many people can do. It's about helping customers find what they need, making sure things are tidy, and sometimes using a cash register. If you're friendly, can follow rules, and don't mind being busy, you might like working in retail. It's a good place to learn how to talk to different people and solve problems."
"(A) No

The Battle of Actium happened a very, very long time ago, way back in 31 BC. It was a big sea battle between two groups in ancient Rome. The ships they used were very different from the ships we have today. The Brazilian Navy today has really advanced ships and technology, like big warships and submarines, and they use things like radar and sonar to find other ships and submarines in the water.

Even though the Brazilian Navy has all this cool stuff now, it wouldn't have been able to help in the Battle of Actium. The people back then didn't have the same kind of technology, and the way they fought was very different. Also, the battle was about more than just the ships; it was about the strategies and the number of soldiers and ships each side had. So, even if the Brazilian Navy could go back in time, it wouldn't have been the same kind of fight, and it's hard to say how it would have turned out. But most likely, the ancient people wouldn't have known how to use the modern ships, and the whole situation would have been too different."
"(A) No

Taco Bell doesn't sell injera. Injera is a special kind of flatbread from Ethiopia, and Taco Bell mostly has Mexican-style food like tacos and burritos. If you want injera, you might need to go to an Ethiopian restaurant."
"B: No

Lord Voldemort, also known as Tom Riddle, is not associated with a staff member of Durmstrang. He was a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and later became a dark wizard. The connection between Voldemort and Durmstrang is not mentioned in the Harry Potter series. Durmstrang is known for having a different headmaster, Igor Karkaroff, who was a former Death Eater but not directly linked to Voldemort in the way the question suggests."

"The answer is (B) Neil Brown, Jr. He plays Henry Mills in the show ""Once Upon a Time."""
"The answer is (B) Barry Bonds. The context tells us that 35 splash hits were by Diego Boneta, but it doesn't say how many Barry Bonds hit. However, it mentions that Barry Bonds is the only Giants player to have reached the Cove more than once, along with Pablo Sandoval and Brandon Belt. Since Barry Bonds is known for hitting a lot of home runs, and the context suggests he has more than one splash hit, it's likely that he has the most splash hits at AT&T Park. But the context doesn't give the exact number for Bonds, so we can't be 100% sure without more information. However, based on what we know, Barry Bonds is the best answer."
"The answer is (A) Eric Liddell. The movie ""Chariots of Fire"" is about two athletes, one of them is Eric Liddell, a devout Scottish Christian, and the other is Harold Abrahams, an English Jew.

"The correct answer is (B) Barry Bonds. The context you gave has a mistake. It's not Albert A. Michelson who holds the Major League Baseball home run record. It's Barry Bonds with 762 home runs. He did pass Hank Aaron, who is second with 755, on August 7, 2007."

"The answer is (A) Alan Shearer. Even though the context talks about Mike Maignan, it seems there's a mix-up because Mike Maignan is not known for scoring a lot of goals in the Premier League.

"The answer is (A) Jason Weaver. He plays John Hancock in the miniseries ""Sons of Liberty."""

The last person to be executed by electric chair in Virginia was actually Robert Gleason in 2013. So, the right answer should be (B) Robert Gleason."
"The answer is (B) Jim. The context given has some mixed-up information. In the TV show ""The Office,"" Pam is married to Jim.

Since the question and the context are a bit tricky, and the correct historical answer isn't listed, I would say the best answer from the choices given is:

(A) John Adams

So, the correct answer is not listed in the options given. The options (A) Lil Pump and (B) Kendrick Perkins are not correct because they are not women and are not mentioned as being in the video in the context provided.
