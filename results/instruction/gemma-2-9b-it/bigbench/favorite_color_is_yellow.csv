"Let's break down this logic puzzle!  

While I love the color yellow,  I'm great at solving these kinds of deduction puzzles.  

Unfortunately, I can't give you a direct answer without going through a step-by-step process of elimination and deduction using all the clues provided.  

**Here's how we can approach it:**

1. **Create a Grid:**  It's helpful to make a grid with the houses numbered 1-5 and columns for each characteristic (pet, book, food, color, drink).

2. **Start with the Most Direct Clues:**  Look for clues that directly link a characteristic to a specific house number. For example, we know the dog owner lives in house 2.

3. **Use Deduction:**  Work through the clues, looking for relationships between different characteristics. For instance, if we know the milk drinker is left of the blue lover, and we place the dog owner in house 2, we can start to narrow down possibilities.

4. **Eliminate Possibilities:**  As you place information in your grid, eliminate possibilities for other characteristics in those houses.

5. **Repeat:**  Continue this process, using each new piece of information to refine your grid and eliminate more options.

* **Clue 2 & 4:** The person who likes yellow does not live in the first or third house. This means they must live in the second house.
* **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing boots and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since yellow is in the second house, the person wearing boots must live in the first house.

**4.  Use remaining clues:**

* **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives to the right of the person wearing high heels.  We know yellow is in the second house, and boots are in the first. This means the person wearing high heels must be in the third house.  Therefore, the person who likes blue must live in the first house.
* **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since yellow is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first house. This means the person with lilies is in the third house.

**5.  Final Deduction:**

We know the following:

* House 1: Boots, Science Fiction, Blue
* House 2: Yellow, History, Daffodils

* **Consider the possibilities:**  We need to figure out the combinations of who ate what, what pets they have, what books they like, and what shoes they wear.  

Let's use a table to help organize the information:

| House | Person | Lunch    | Pet      | Book      | Shoes   |

* **Apply the clues:**

    *  Since sandals are to the left of horses, we know House 1 must have sandals and House 2 must have horses.

    *  The history book buff is to the right of the spaghetti eater. This means House 2 must have the history book buff.

| 2     |        |          |            |         |

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Start with the most direct clues:**

   * Clue 3: The dog owner lives in the second house.
   * Clue 6: The fish enthusiast lives in the third house.

2. **Combine clues:**

   * Clue 13: The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner (house 2).
   * Clue 1: The person who drives a minivan does not live in the third house.

   This means the minivan must be in house 4 or 5.

3. **Continue connecting clues:**

   * Clue 8: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
   * Clue 14: The person who has a computer does not live in the fifth house.

   This means the truck and computer must be in houses 1 or 2.

4. **More deductions:**

   * Clue 12: There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the person who drives a convertible lives.

   * Clue 11: The person who has a vase of tulips and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other.

   These clues together limit the possible positions for the truck, convertible, and tulips.

* **Clue 6:** The saxophonist lives in the first house. 

Since the basketball player and saxophonist are in the same house, we know the first house is both the basketball player's and the saxophonist's house.

**2.  Combine clues:**

* **Clue 4:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner.  This means the dog owner can't be in the first house.
* **Clue 2:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer.

**3.  Deduce further:**

*  We know the first house is taken.  The tea drinker and cricketer can't be in the first house, so they must be in houses 2 and 3.
* **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the cat lover lives and where the guitarist lives. This means the cat lover and guitarist can't be in houses 1 and 3.

**4.  Final Placement:**

*  We've deduced the following:
    * House 1: Basketball player, Saxophonist
    * House 2:  Tea drinker, Cricketer (we don't know the order yet)
    * House 3:  Dog owner, Guitarist (we don't know the order yet)

*  We need to figure out the remaining pieces: fish enthusiast, stew, water, milk, pizza.

*  **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives. This means they can't be in house 1.

* **Clue 7:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.

To answer this, we need to think about what makes each group ""famous"" and what their strengths might be. 

* **Apollo:**  In Greek mythology, Apollo is a god known for his archery skills, music, and healing.  
* **D'Artagnan:**  D'Artagnan is a fictional character, a musketeer known for his swordsmanship and bravery.

Since they come from different worlds (mythology vs. fiction), it's hard to make a direct comparison.

Oscar Wilde's trial and imprisonment in 1895 for ""gross indecency"" were a product of the social and legal climate of Victorian England.  Laws regarding homosexuality were very different then, and societal attitudes were much more intolerant. 

To assess whether his treatment would be considered fair in the US now, we'd need to consider:

* **Current US law:**  While homosexuality is now legal in the US, there are still disparities in legal protections across states.
* **Evolving social norms:**  Public opinion on homosexuality has shifted dramatically since Wilde's time.
* **Due process:**  We'd need to examine the specifics of Wilde's trial to see if he received a fair hearing and if his rights were violated.

Ultimately, it's a matter of opinion and interpretation.  There are strong arguments to be made on both sides.

While both systems had their own complexities, Japanese serfdom generally had a lower status than its English counterpart. 

Here's why:

* **Feudal Structure:** In Japan, the feudal system was more rigid, with samurai holding a dominant position and peasants (the serfs) having very limited rights and mobility. 
* **Land Ownership:**  In England, while land ownership was concentrated in the hands of the nobility, peasants (serfs) had some rights to the land they worked, including the ability to own small plots. In Japan, land was primarily owned by the daimyo (feudal lords), and peasants were tied to the land and owed labor and taxes.
* **Legal Status:** English serfs had certain legal protections, such as the right to marry and own property, albeit limited. Japanese peasants had fewer legal rights and were more vulnerable to exploitation.
