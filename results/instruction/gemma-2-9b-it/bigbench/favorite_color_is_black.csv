"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

* **Start with the knowns:**

    * Flutist lives in house 2.
    * Tulips are to the left of the guitarist.
    * Lilies are to the left of carnations.
    * One house between the flutist and the pianist.

* **Deduce:**

    * Since the flutist is in house 2, the pianist must be in either house 1 or 3. 
    *  The tulips and guitarist can't be in house 2 (flutist) or house 3 (pianist).

* **Consider the lilies and carnations:** They are together, so they must be in either houses 1 and 2, or houses 3 and 4.

* **The solution:**  The only arrangement that fits all the clues is:

    * House 1: Tulips, Guitarist
    * House 2: Flutist
    * House 3: Pianist
    * House 4: Lilies, Carnations

* **Let's start with the clues:**

    * Clue 1: Convertible driver is directly left of the history book buff.  
    * Clue 2: Boots wearer doesn't live in house 1.

* **Consider the possibilities:** Since we have two houses, we can use a simple grid to keep track:

    |---|---|---|---|---|
    | 1 |  |  |  |  |

    | 2 |  | Boots |  |  |

* **Use the clues to deduce more:**

    * Clue 1 tells us the convertible driver is left of the history book buff. This means they must be in house 1 and the history buff in house 2.

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

* **Start with the most definitive clues:**

    * Clue 3 tells us the root beer lover doesn't live in house 2.
    * Clue 4 tells us the orange eater doesn't live in house 2.

* **Combine clues:**

    * Clue 1 states the coffee drinker is to the left of the mango eater.  This means they can't both be in houses 2 or 3.

* **Deduction:**

    * Since the root beer lover isn't in house 2, and the orange eater isn't in house 2, the only remaining possibility for the root beer lover is **house 1** or **house 3**. 

* **We need more information to be certain.**

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

* **Clue 3:** The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
* **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. 

This means the person wearing loafers must live in either house 2 or 3.

Let's analyze the remaining clues:

* **Clue 1:** The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house.
* **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.

Since the person who ate fried rice can't be in house 2, and the person wearing boots lives to their left, the person wearing boots must live in house 1.

**Therefore, the person wearing loafers must live in house 3.**

**3.  Deduce and Connect**

Now we need to use the remaining clues and logic to fill in the rest of the grid.  Here's a breakdown of how to approach it:

* **Focus on pairs:**  Many clues link two things together (e.g., ""The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti"").  Use these to start connecting information.
* **Elimination:** As you fill in information, eliminate possibilities for other houses and items.
* **Look for patterns:**  Sometimes clues create patterns that can help you deduce further information.

   * House 4: Baseball Player, Loafers
   * House 3: Running Shoes
   * House 1: Not Mangoes
   * House 3: Not Oranges

"Let's break down this logic puzzle step-by-step.  

While I don't have a visual representation, I can use the clues to deduce the solution.  

**Here's a strategy:**

1. **Start with the most direct clues:** Look for clues that directly link a characteristic to a specific house number or position.

2. **Build connections:** Use clues that link different characteristics together. For example, if we know ""The baseball player lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese,"" we can start to place those two together.

3. **Eliminate possibilities:** As you make connections, eliminate houses and possibilities for each characteristic.

4. **Look for patterns:**  Sometimes clues create patterns or sequences that can help you narrow down the options.

**Let's apply this to the clues:**

* **Focus on clues related to the swimmer:**
    * Clue 7: ""There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the mystery book reader lives.""

"Let's break down this logic puzzle!  

While I don't have a preference for black, I'm great at solving these kinds of logic puzzles.  

Unfortunately, I can't provide a definitive answer to your question without a visual aid or a more structured way to represent the clues and their relationships.  

**Here's why:**

* **Too Many Variables:**  There are a lot of interconnected pieces of information (houses, people, characteristics). 
* **Indirect Relationships:**  Many clues involve ""between"" statements or ""to the left/right of"" which make it hard to track visually.

**How to Solve This Type of Puzzle:**

1. **Grid Method:** The best way to solve this is to create a grid with the houses numbered 1-5 and columns for each characteristic (flower, instrument, car, book, pet).

2. **Start with Direct Clues:**  Fill in the grid with any direct statements (e.g., ""The saxophonist and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other"").

3. **Process Indirect Clues:**  Use the ""between"" clues to deduce relationships and fill in more of the grid.

4. **Look for Patterns:**  As you fill in the grid, look for patterns and eliminate possibilities.

   * Clue 2: ""The baseball player does not live in the second house.""  We can mark ""House 2"" as unavailable for the baseball player.

3. **Look for Direct Links:**  Clues like ""The swimmer and the person who likes white live directly next to each other"" allow us to place those two together in the grid.

4. **Deduction:**  As we fill in more information, we can use logic to deduce where other people and their characteristics must live. For example, if we know the pianist is to the right of the coffee drinker, and we know the coffee drinker is in a specific house, we can place the pianist.

**Let's work together!**  Provide me with the clues one by one, and I'll help you fill in the grid and deduce the location of the pianist.

* **Clue 3:** Root Beer Lover - Guitarist (together)

**2.  Deduction:**

* Since the root beer lover and guitarist live together, they must occupy either houses 1 and 2.

* We know the cellist is to the left of the mystery book reader.  This means the cellist can't be in house 2.

*  The history book buff is to the left of the cat lover.  

**3.  Solution:**

Based on these deductions, the only possible arrangement is:

* **House 1:** Cellist, Tea Drinker, Horses
* **House 2:** Guitarist, Root Beer Lover, Cat Lover

 
**Therefore, the person who owns horses lives in House 1 (A).**
