* **Let's start with the clues:**

    * Clue 1: Convertible driver is directly left of the history book buff.  
    * Clue 2: Boots wearer doesn't live in house 1.

* **Consider the possibilities:** Since we have two houses, we can use a simple grid to keep track:

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

* **Clue 1:** The pianist lives in the first house. 
* **Clue 3:** The person who likes white does not live in the second house.

Let's use a table to keep track:

| House | Person | Pet    | Color | Drink | Instrument |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|--------|------------|
| 1     |        |         |       |        | Pianist     |
| 2     |        |         | White |        |            |

Now we need to use Clue 2: ""The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.""  This means the horse owner must live in House 1.

Let's update our table:

| House | Person | Pet    | Color | Drink | Instrument |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|--------|------------|
| 1     |        | Horses |       |        | Pianist     |
| 2     |        |         | White |        |            |

We know the dog owner and the root beer lover are the remaining two. Since the root beer lover is to the right of the horse owner, the root beer lover must live in House 2.

Let's update again:

| House | Person | Pet    | Color | Drink | Instrument |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|--------|------------|
| 1     |        | Horses |       |        | Pianist     |

2. **Start with Direct Clues:**  Fill in the grid with the information from the direct clues (e.g., ""The baseball player lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese"").

3. **Look for Relationships:**  Identify clues that establish relationships between different categories (e.g., ""There is one house between where the person who is wearing loafers lives and where the person who is wearing running shoes lives"").

4. **Deduce and Eliminate:** Use the relationships and direct clues to deduce the possibilities for each house.  Eliminate options as you go.

5. **Repeat:** Continue this process, working through the clues systematically.

**Remember:**  

* Pay close attention to words like ""directly left,"" ""directly right,"" ""one house between,"" etc.
*  Don't jump to conclusions.  Make sure your deductions are supported by the clues.

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

* **Start with the clues:**

    *  Clue 1: Sandals are to the left of horses.
    *  Clue 2: History book lover is to the right of the spaghetti eater.

* **Consider the possibilities:**  We need to figure out the combinations of who ate what, what pets they have, what books they like, and what shoes they wear.  

Let's use a table to help organize the information:

| House | Person | Lunch    | Pet      | Book      | Shoes   |
|-------|--------|----------|----------|-----------|---------|
| 1     |        |           |          |           |         |
| 2     |        |           |          |           |         |

* **Apply the clues:**

    *  Since sandals are to the left of horses, we know House 1 must have sandals and House 2 must have horses.

    *  The history book lover is to the right of the spaghetti eater. This means House 2 must have the history book lover.

* **Deduce the rest:**

    *  We know fried rice and spaghetti are the only lunch options left. Since House 2 has the history book lover, House 1 must have the spaghetti eater.
    *  This leaves fried rice for House 2.
    *  We can fill in the rest of the table based on the remaining options.



**Answer:** The person who ate fried rice lives in **House 2**.

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

* **Clue 1:** The sedan owner is to the left of the lilies. 
* **Clue 2:** The flutist doesn't live in house 1.

Let's use a table to keep track:

| House | Person | Flowers | Instrument | Car    |
|-------|--------|---------|------------|---------|
| 1     |        |          |            |         |
| 2     |        |          |            |         |

We know the flutist isn't in house 1, so let's place them in house 2:

| House | Person | Flowers | Instrument | Car    |
|-------|--------|---------|------------|---------|
| 1     |        |          |            |         |
| 2     |        |          | Flutist    |         |

Now, clue 1 tells us the sedan owner is to the left of the lilies.  Since the flutist is in house 2, the sedan owner must be in house 1.

| House | Person | Flowers | Instrument | Car    |
|-------|--------|---------|------------|---------|
| 1     |        |          |            | Sedan   |
| 2     |        |          | Flutist    |         |

Therefore, the person with the lilies must live in **house 2**.

**3.  Deduce further:**

* Since the swimmer and tennis player can't be in houses 1 and 2, and the fantasy book enthusiast is to the left of the swimmer, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in house 1.
* This means the swimmer lives in house 2.
* The tennis player must live in house 3 or 4.

**4.  Use remaining clues:**

* **Clue 5:** The golfer is to the right of the daffodils.
* **Clue 8:** There's one house between the daffodils and the roses.

"Let's break down this logic puzzle!  

While I don't have a preference for white, I'm great at solving these kinds of logic puzzles.  

Unfortunately, I can't provide a definitive answer to your question without a visual aid or a more structured way to represent the clues and their relationships.  

**Here's why:**

* **Too Many Variables:**  There are a lot of interconnected pieces of information (houses, people, characteristics). 
* **Indirect Relationships:**  Many clues involve ""between"" statements or relative positions, making it hard to track without a visual.

**How to Solve This Type of Puzzle:**

1. **Create a Grid:**  A grid with rows for each house and columns for each characteristic (flower, instrument, car, book, pet) is very helpful.

2. **Start with Direct Clues:**  Fill in the grid with any information you know for sure from the clues.

3. **Use Deduction:**  Look for clues that link different characteristics. For example, if you know the saxophonist lives next to the science fiction fan, you can place them together in your grid.

4. **Process of Elimination:**  As you fill in more information, you can eliminate possibilities for other houses and characteristics.
