"Here's how we can solve this puzzle:

* **Clue 1:** The flutist lives in the second house. 
* **Clue 4:** There's one house between the flutist and the pianist.  This means the pianist lives in either house 1 or 3.

Let's use a table to keep track:

| House | Person | Flower   | Instrument |
|-------|--------|----------|------------|
| 1     |        |           |            |
| 2     | Flutist |           |            |
| 3     |        |           | Pianist     |
| 4     |        |           |            |

* **Clue 2:** The tulips are to the left of the guitarist.  Since we don't know where the guitarist is yet, we can't place the tulips.

"Here's how we can solve this puzzle:

**1. Start with the most direct clues:**

* **Clue 5:** The person who likes green lives in the first house.
* **Clue 8:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

**2. Combine clues:**

* **Clue 1:** The root beer lover lives to the left of the grape eater.
* **Clue 3:** The water drinker lives to the left of the root beer lover.  This means the order so far is: Water - Root Beer - Grapes

Let's try to fit the rest of the pieces:

*  The blue lover and gameboy owner must be together, and there's one house between the cellist and gameboy. This means the cellist can't be in the first or last house.

* **Clue 1:** The convertible driver is to the left of the history book buff.  
* **Clue 2:** The person in boots doesn't live in house 1.

Let's think about it step-by-step:

    * House 1:  Let's call this person ""A""
    * House 2: Let's call this person ""B""

2.  **Clue 1:**  The convertible driver is left of the history book buff. This means:
    *  A could be the convertible driver and B the history buff.
    *  Or B could be the convertible driver and A the history buff.

* **Clue 8:** The person eating a banana lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast, so they must be in house #4.
* **Clue 6:** There is one house between where the person eating apples lives and where the person wearing boots lives. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in house #3, the person eating apples must be in house #1 and the person wearing boots must be in house #4.

**1. Start with the most direct clues:**

* **Clue 1:** The tea drinker lives in the third house.
* **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.

**2. Combine clues:**

* **Clue 2:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

This means the order so far could look something like this:

*  Running shoes - Stew -  ? - Spaghetti

* **Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.

* **Clue 7:** The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.

This means the grilled cheese person can't be in house 1.

**3.  Keep piecing it together:**

We know the tea drinker is in house 3.  We also know the high heels and water person are together.  

Let's try placing them:

*  Running shoes - Stew -  ? - Spaghetti

"
"Here's how we can figure this out:

* **Clue 1:** The pianist lives in the first house (house #1).

* **Clue 3:** The person who likes white doesn't live in the second house.

Let's use a table to keep track:

| House | Person | Pet   | Color | Drink | Instrument |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|--------|------------|
| 1     |        |        |       |        | Pianist     |
| 2     |        |        | White |        |           |

Now we need to use clue 2:

* **Clue 2:** The root beer lover lives to the right of the horse owner. This means the horse owner must live in house #1.

Let's update our table:

| House | Person | Pet   | Color | Drink | Instrument |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|--------|------------|
| 1     |        | Horses |       |        | Pianist     |
| 2     |        |        | White |        |           |

We know the dog owner and the root beer lover are still missing.  Since the root beer lover is to the right of the horse owner, the root beer lover must live in house #2.  

Let's fill that in:

| House | Person | Pet   | Color | Drink | Instrument |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|--------|------------|
| 1     |        | Horses |       |        | Pianist     |
| 2     |        |        | White | Root Beer |           |

This leaves the dog owner and the blue color lover. Since the white lover doesn't live in house #2, the blue lover must live there.

| House | Person | Pet   | Color | Drink | Instrument |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|--------|------------|
| 1     |        | Horses |       |        | Pianist     |
| 2     |        | Dog   | Blue  | Root Beer |           |

Putting it all together, we can start to fill in the houses:

* **House 1:**  We don't know yet
* **House 2:** Daffodils
* **House 3:** Roses
* **House 4:** Carnations

We know the fantasy book enthusiast and swimmer are together, and the mystery book reader is near the swimmer.  The tennis player is to the right of the mystery book reader and not in house 4. This means the mystery book reader must be in house 1.

* **House 1:** Mystery book reader
* **House 2:** Daffodils
* **House 3:** Roses
* **House 4:** Carnations

**2.  Combine clues:**

* **Clue 5:** The person wearing boots lives directly left of the person wearing high heels.

"Here's how we can solve this puzzle:

* **Start with the most direct clues:**

    * Clue 2 tells us the water drinker lives in house 2.
    * Clue 3 tells us the root beer lover lives in house 1.

* **Combine clues:**

    * Clue 1 says the daffodil person lives left of the phone person.  Since we know the root beer lover is in house 1, the daffodil person must be in house 2 (because there's no house to the left of house 1).
    * Clue 4 says the TV person doesn't live in house 2.

* **Deduce the rest:**

    * Clue 5 says the TV person lives to the right of the tulip person.  Since the daffodil person is in house 2, the tulip person must be in house 1. This means the TV person is in house 3.
    *  We know the root beer lover is in house 1, the water drinker is in house 2, and the TV person is in house 3.  The only drink left is milk, so the milk drinker must be in house 1.



**Answer:** The milk lover lives in house **1**. 
"
"Let's break this down step by step using the clues:

* **Clue 1:** The person with loafers lives in house 1.
* **Clue 3:** The person eating grapes lives to the left of the person who drinks only water. 
* **Clue 5:** The person eating kiwis lives to the left of the person who likes milk.
* **Clue 7:** The person eating kiwis does NOT live in house 1.

Combining these clues, we can start to arrange things:

* House 1: Loafers,  (We don't know the other things yet)
* House 2:  (We don't know)
* House 3: (We don't know)

We know the person with the phone is to the left of the person eating mangos (Clue 2), and the person with boots is to the right of the person with the gameboy (Clue 6).  

We also know the person with boots doesn't live in house 3 (Clue 4).

* **Clue 3:** The golfer and the baseball player live next to each other.  Let's represent them as ""G"" and ""B"". They could be in houses like this:  _GB_  or  _BG_
* **Clue 4:** The person with carnations and the horse owner live next to each other. Let's represent them as ""C"" and ""H"". They could be in houses like this: _CH_ or _HC_
* **Clue 6:** The rose bouquet is to the left of the daffodils. Let's represent them as ""R"" and ""D"". They could be in houses like this: _RD_

**2. Combine the clues:**

* **Clue 1:** The golfer doesn't live in house 3.  
* **Clue 2:** The fish enthusiast (let's call them ""F"") lives to the left of the horse owner. So, it has to be  _FHC_ or _FCH_
* **Clue 5:** The carnations are to the left of the baseball player. This means the order has to be  _CGB_ or _CBG_
* **Clue 7:** The cricketer (let's call them ""Cr"") doesn't live in house 3.

**3.  Deduce the solution:**

By carefully looking at all the clues and possible arrangements, you'll find that the only solution that fits all the clues is:

 **House 1:**  Fish Enthusiast (F)
 **House 2:**  Carnations (C)
 **House 3:**  Golfer (G)

"Here's how we can solve this:

* **Clue 1 tells us the violinist lives in house 1.** 
* **Clue 2 tells us the computer owner is to the left of the bird keeper.**

This means the bird keeper must live in **house 2**.

Let's put this together:

Now we know:

* House 1: Cat lover, High heels
* House 2: Boots

* **The only shoe left is running shoes, so the person wearing running shoes must live in house 2.**




**Answer: (A) 2** 
"

* **Clue 2** says the kiwi eater is to the left of the blue lover.

* **Clue 6** says the boots wearer is to the left of the green lover.
