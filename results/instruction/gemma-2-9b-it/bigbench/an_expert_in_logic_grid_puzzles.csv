"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Start with the most direct clues:**

* **Clue 1:** The flutist lives in the second house. 
* **Clue 3:** The person with lilies lives directly left of the person with carnations.

**2.  Combine clues:**

* **Clue 2:** The tulip person lives directly left of the guitarist.  

**3.  Deduce:**

* Since we know the flutist is in house 2, and there's one house between the flutist and the pianist, the pianist must be in house 4.
*  We can now place the lilies and carnations together, as they are next to each other.  

**4.  Final Placement:**

Let's represent the houses with numbers and the characteristics with letters:

* House 1:  ?  ?
* House 2:  Flutist
* House 3:  ?  ?
* House 4:  Pianist

**3.  Deduce and Fill:**

Now, carefully analyze the remaining clues and use them to deduce information and fill in the grid.  Remember to consider the relationships between clues (e.g., ""to the left of"").

**Example Deduction:**

* **Clue 1:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.  Since we know the kiwi eater is in house 1, the root beer lover cannot be in house 1.

Continue this process, carefully noting down each deduction and updating your grid.

"Let's break down this logic puzzle step-by-step.  I'll use a grid to help keep track of the information:

**Setting up the Grid**

| House | Person | Flower | Instrument | Car      | Book      | Pet      |
|-------|--------|---------|------------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| 1     |        |          |            |           |           |          |
| 2     |        |          |            |           |           |          |
| 3     |        |          |            |           |           |          |
| 4     |        |          |            |           |           |          |
| 5     |        |          |            |           |           |          |

**Entering the Clues**

We'll start by entering the ""direct"" clues into the grid.  Remember, direct clues tell us exactly where something is located.

* **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives. 
* **Clue 2:** The saxophonist and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.
* **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who drives a convertible lives and where the bird keeper lives.
* **Clue 4:** The pianist lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
* **Clue 11:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the cat lover.
* **Clue 12:** The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
* **Clue 13:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
* **Clue 16:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.

...and so on.

**Using Deduction**

Once we have the direct clues in, we can start using deduction to fill in the rest of the grid.  Here are some deduction techniques we can use:

* **Elimination:** If we know something *can't* be in a certain house, we can eliminate that possibility.
* **Logical Linking:** If we know two things are related (e.g., the saxophonist and the science fiction book fanatic live next to each other), we can use that to deduce where they must be located.
* **Looking for Patterns:** Sometimes, patterns emerge in the clues that can help us make deductions.

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

**1. Set up a Grid**

It's helpful to create a grid to keep track of the information:

| House | Person | Instrument | Fruit |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |

**2.  Analyze the Clues**

* **Clue 1:** The pianist and the kiwi eater live next to each other.  We can represent this in the grid with ""P"" for pianist and ""K"" for kiwi:

   | House | Person | Instrument | Fruit |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | 1 |  |  |  |
   | 2 |  |  |  |
   | 3 |  |  |  |

   We know they could be in houses 1 & 2, or 2 & 3.

* **Clue 2:** The flutist lives to the right of the violinist. Let's represent them as ""F"" and ""V"":

   | House | Person | Instrument | Fruit |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | 1 |  |  |  |
   | 2 |  |  |  |
   | 3 |  |  |  |

   This means the violinist can't be in house 3.

* **Clue 3:** One house between grapes (""G"") and kiwis:

   | House | Person | Instrument | Fruit |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | 1 |  |  |  |
   | 2 |  |  |  |
   | 3 |  |  |  |

* **Clue 4:** One house between the violinist and kiwis:

   | House | Person | Instrument | Fruit |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | 1 |  |  |  |
   | 2 |  |  |  |
   | 3 |  |  |  |

**3. Deduction**

Now we need to combine the clues and see what fits.  

Since the pianist and kiwi eater are together, and the flutist is to the right of the violinist, the only possible arrangement is:

| House | Person | Instrument | Fruit |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  | Violinist | Grapes |
| 2 | Pianist |  | Kiwis |
| 3 | Flutist |  | Oranges |



**Answer:** The pianist lives in **house 2**.  **(B)**"
"The fantasy book enthusiast lives in **house 2**. 

Here's how we know:

* **Clue 1:** The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
* **Clue 2:** The person eating kiwis lives in the first house.

"Let's break down this logic grid puzzle step-by-step.  

**1. Set up your Grid:**

Create a grid with the following columns:

* House Number (1-4)
* Instrument
* Color
* Sport
* Fruit
* Drink

**2. Start Filling in the Grid:**

Use the clues to start filling in the grid.  Here's how to approach it:

* **Direct Clues:**  Clues that directly link a characteristic to a specific house or position are the easiest to start with. For example, Clue 2 tells us the baseball player doesn't live in house 2.
* **Relative Clues:** Clues that use words like ""between,"" ""left,"" ""right,"" ""next to"" require careful placement.  

**3. Look for Deductions:**

As you fill in the grid, look for opportunities to deduce information. For example, if you know the swimmer lives to the left of the water drinker, and you know the swimmer and white-lover are next to each other, you can start to narrow down possibilities.

**4. Process of Elimination:**

Use the process of elimination to rule out possibilities. If you know a certain fruit can't be in a particular house, eliminate that fruit from the possibilities for that house.

**5. Repeat:**

Keep going through the clues, filling in the grid, making deductions, and eliminating possibilities.

To answer this, we need to consider the specific rules Voldemort likely had in mind when he created the ""pure-blood"" supremacy ideology.  

Here's why it's complex:

* **Voldemort's Rules:**  We know Voldemort believed in ""pure-blood"" superiority.  He likely would have seen Muggle-borns as inherently inferior and unworthy of Hogwarts.
* **Hogwarts' Acceptance:** Hogwarts, at its core, is a school for witches and wizards of *all* backgrounds.  It's founded on the principles of magic education, not blood purity.

**The Catch:**

Voldemort's rules were based on prejudice, not logic or Hogwarts' founding principles.  He wouldn't have been barred by the school itself, but his own beliefs would have led him to try and *destroy* Hogwarts and its inclusive nature.
