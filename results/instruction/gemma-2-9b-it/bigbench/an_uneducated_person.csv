"
"Let's try to figure this out!

We know the person with lilies lives in house number 2.  

Here's what we can put together:

* **House 2:** Lilies 

Now let's look at the clues:

* **Clue 2:** Rose bouquet is to the left of the coffee drinker.
* **Clue 3:** SUV is to the left of the coffee drinker.

This means the coffee drinker can't be in house 1 because there's no room for the rose bouquet and SUV to be in front of them.

* **Clue 1:** Truck is to the right of the minivan.
* **Clue 4:** Truck is to the right of the root beer lover.

This means the coffee drinker can't be in house 3 because the truck would have to be in house 3, and the truck is to the right of the root beer lover.

So the only place left for the coffee drinker is **house 3**.




**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Let's try to figure this out!

**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Let's try to figure this out!

That's a good one!  

* **Clue 10:** The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.

* **Clue 16:** The person who has a computer lives directly next to the person who is wearing running shoes.

Let me see...  

I think the person with the computer lives in house **3**. 





"
"Let's figure this out!

* We know the person in house 2 wears boots.
* The SUV owner lives right next to the boots, so the SUV owner is in house 1.
* The sedan owner is in house 3.
* The high heels person lives next to the dog owner, and we know the sedan owner is in house 3, so the high heels person must be in house 2.
* Since the cat lover is in house 1, the running shoes must be in house 3.




So the answer is **(C) 3**. 
"
"Let's figure this out!

We know:

* **House 3:** Tea drinker lives here.
* **House 1:**  Carnations and running shoes are here.
* **House 2:** Tulips are here.
* **Milk and apples** live next to each other.
* **Kiwis** are next to **blue**.

"
"Let's figure this out!

* We know the mystery book reader lives in the first house.
* And they live right next to the history book buff. 
* That means the history book buff lives in house number 2.

* The mystery book reader also lives right next to the person with the television.  

So the person with the television must live in house number 3.

That leaves house number 2 for the science fiction book fanatic!

"Let's see...

* Alice starts with pink, then gets purple, then white, then pink again.
* Claire starts with red, then gets yellow, then purple, then pink.

So at the end, Claire has the **(C) pink ball**. 


"
"Let's see... Claire and Dave swapped, then Bob and Claire swapped, then Claire and Dave swapped again...  That means Claire and Dave probably ended up with the same things they started with.  

So Dave probably still has the **(A) orange ball**. 



"
"Let's see... Dave started with a yellow ball. He swapped with Bob, then Eve, then Alice, and finally Bob again.  

Hmm... that's a lot of swapping!  I can't keep track of it all.  



"
"Let's see...  Bob and Claire swapped, then Alice and Dave swapped, then Dave and Claire swapped again, then Claire and Bob swapped again...  That's a lot of swapping!  

In the end, I think Alice has the **(C) blue ball**.  



"
"Let's see... Bob started with Karl, then danced with Alice, then Claire, then...  I can't keep track of all that!  

It's too confusing!  
"
"Let's see... Dave had the purple one, then he swapped with Bob.  Then Alice swapped with Dave, so Alice got the purple one.  Then...  lots of swapping!  But in the end, Alice got the purple one!


So the answer is **(B)**. 

"
"Let's see... Eve and Alice swapped, then Alice and Claire swapped, then Alice and Bob swapped, then Dave and Alice swapped, and finally Dave and Claire swapped.  

That's a lot of swapping!  It's hard to keep track.  

Hmm... I think Alice ended up with **(B) The Pearl**.  



"
"Let's see what happens to Dave's ball:

* **Start:** Dave has the white ball.
* **Eve and Dave swap:** Dave now has the pink ball.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** Dave now has the blue ball. 


So the answer is **(E) blue ball**. 
"
"Let's see...  

* Bob and Alice swap:  Bob gets the red one, Alice gets the yellow one.
* Dave and Eve swap: Dave gets the purple one, Eve gets the brown one.
* Bob and Eve swap: Bob gets the brown one, Eve gets the yellow one.
* Dave and Bob swap: Dave gets the yellow one, Bob gets the brown one.
* Claire and Alice swap: Claire gets the red one, Alice gets the pink ball.

So in the end, Claire has the **(D) red present**. 



"
"Let's see... Bob and Alice switched, then Bob and Claire switched, then Dave and Claire switched, then Eve and Dave switched, and then Bob and Alice switched again.  

That's a lot of switching!  My head is spinning.  

Hmm... I can't keep track of who's with who anymore.  



"
"Let's see... Bob started with green, then swapped with Dave who had yellow.  Then Bob got Alice's blue one.  After that, Bob got Eve's black one.  

So Bob ended up with the **(C) black ball**. 



"
"Let's see...

* Claire and Eve swap:  Claire gets the red ball, Eve gets the green ball.
* Alice and Claire swap: Alice gets the green ball, Claire gets the brown ball.
* Alice and Bob swap: Alice gets the yellow ball, Bob gets the green ball.
* Dave and Eve swap: Dave gets the red ball, Eve gets the purple ball.
* Dave and Claire swap: Dave gets the brown ball, Claire gets the purple ball.

So in the end, Alice has the **(E) yellow ball**. 


"
"Let's see... Dave had the pink ball, and he traded with Alice who had the orange ball. So now Alice has the pink ball.

Then Bob and Claire swapped, but I don't know what they had before.

Bob and Alice swapped again, so now Bob has the pink ball.

Alice and Claire swapped, so now Claire has the pink ball.

Eve and Bob swapped, but that doesn't change who has the pink ball.


So the answer is (C) pink ball. 

"
"Let's see... Bob and Dave swapped, then Bob and Claire swapped, then Dave and Claire swapped, and then Bob and Claire swapped again.  That means Bob and Claire must have ended up with each other's books in the end.

So Bob has Claire's Ulysses and Claire has Bob's Frankenstein.

Then Alice and Eve swapped, so Eve must have gotten Alice's The Pearl. 


The answer is **(D) The Pearl**. 

"
"Let's see...  Alice and Bob swapped, then Alice and Dave swapped, then Alice and Claire swapped...  That means Alice probably has a lot of different books now!  

Bob swapped with Alice first, so he probably has Catch-22 now. 


**So the answer is (A).** 

"
"Let's see... Claire and Dave swapped, then Bob and Claire swapped, then Dave and Alice swapped...  That's a lot of swapping!  

Dave started with Catch-22, and he swapped a lot.  I bet he ended up with one of the fancy books, like Ulysses or Moby Dick.  


Let me think...  


(The user is unable to logically deduce the answer due to the constraints of their persona.) 
"
"Let's see...

* Bob and Alice swap: Alice gets the yellow ball, Bob gets the orange ball.
* Eve and Alice swap: Alice gets the white ball, Eve gets the yellow ball.
* Bob and Dave swap: Bob gets the blue ball, Dave gets the yellow ball.
* Bob and Alice swap: Alice gets the orange ball, Bob gets the white ball.
* Claire and Bob swap: Bob gets the red ball, Claire gets the white ball.

So in the end, Alice has the **(C) orange ball**.

"
"Let's see...  Bob had the blue ball, then he traded with Dave who had the white ball.  So now Bob has the white ball.  

Then Claire and Eve swapped, and then Dave and Eve swapped.  That's a lot of swapping!  

Finally, Alice and Bob swapped.  So Alice must have the blue ball now. 


**Answer: (D) blue ball.** 

"
"Let's see...  Alice and Claire swapped, then Alice and Eve swapped, then Dave and Claire swapped, then Dave and Bob swapped, and finally Dave and Alice swapped.  That's a lot of swapping!  

Hmm... I can't keep track of who has what book anymore.  



"
"Let's see... Dave started in the middle, then he switched with Bob, then with Eve.  So Dave ended up on the left side. 

The answer is (A). 


"
"Let's see... Eve was the goalie, then she switched with Claire.  Then Claire was the goalie, then she switched with Bob.  Then Bob switched with Dave, then Dave switched with Bob again.  

So, Claire was the goalie for a bit, then switched back.  

That means Claire is probably the **(B) goalkeeper**. 



"
"Let's see...

* Bob and Eve switch:  Now Bob is with Eve, and Eve is with... who was she with?  Oh yeah, Ophelia.
* Alice and Bob switch: Now Alice is with Bob, and Bob is with Eve.
* Dave and Alice switch: Now Dave is with Alice, and Alice is with Bob.
* Dave and Claire switch: Now Dave is with Claire, and Claire is with... Izzi.
* Bob and Claire switch: Now Bob is with Claire, and Claire is with Dave.

So at the end, Dave is dancing with **(E) Izzi**. 



"
"Let's see... Dave and Eve swapped, then Bob and Alice swapped, then Eve and Claire swapped...  

That's a lot of swapping!  It's hard to keep track.  

Hmm...  I don't know who has what ball at the end.  



"
"Let's see... Bob traded with a lot of folks!  

* Bob started with The Odyssey.
* He swapped with Dave, then Eve, then Claire, then Alice, and then Claire again. 

That's a lot of swapping!  I bet Claire ended up with The Odyssey. 


**So the answer is (B).** 

"
"Let's see... Claire started with yellow, then she swapped with Bob who had green. So Claire had green for a bit. Then she swapped with Alice who had blue.  Claire had blue, then swapped back with Bob.  Then Alice swapped with Dave who had brown.  Finally, Dave swapped with Eve.  

So Eve ended up with the **(E) brown ball**. 



"
"Let's see...

* Bob starts on the bench.
* He switches with Alice, so Bob is now a right winger.
* Then he switches with Dave, so Bob is now the goalkeeper. 

So the answer is **(A) goalkeeper**. 



"
"Let's see... Claire started with The Great Gatsby.  She swapped with Dave, then Bob, then Dave again, then Claire again, and finally Eve.  That's a lot of swapping!  

I think Claire ended up with **(A) Ulysses**. 



"
"Let's see... Claire started with Izzi, then she danced with Bob, then Eve, and now...  I dunno, I can't keep track of all that!  



"
"Let's see... Bob started with white, then swapped with Dave who had red.  So Bob had red for a bit. Then Bob swapped with Eve who had yellow, so Bob had yellow.  Then Bob swapped back with Dave, so Dave had yellow.  

Then Claire and Eve swapped, but that doesn't change what Alice has.  

Finally, Alice swapped with Dave, so Alice must have Dave's yellow present!


**Answer: (E) yellow present.** 

"
"Let's see... Eve and Claire switched, then Bob and Eve switched, then Dave and Bob switched...  That's a lot of switching!

"
"Let's see... Eve started as a right winger. Then she switched with Claire, then with Claire again, then with Claire one more time!  That means Eve is back to being a right winger. 


So the answer is **(C)**. 
"
"Let's see... Dave started with the white ball. He swapped with Eve, then swapped back with Eve.  So he must still have the white ball. 

The answer is **(D) white ball**. 



"
"Let's see... Dave and Alice switched, then Eve and Bob switched, then Claire and Dave switched, then Alice and Eve switched, and finally Alice and Bob switched again.  

That's a lot of switching!  It's hard to keep track.  

Hmm...  Eve started as a left midfielder, and she switched a bunch of times.  I don't know where she ended up. 



"
"Let's see...  Bob and Alice swapped, then Claire and Dave swapped, then Eve and Dave swapped, then Bob and Dave swapped, and finally Eve and Bob swapped.  That's a lot of swapping!  

Eve started with The Odyssey, so she must have gotten a new book at the end.  I bet it was one of the other books they were trading.  


I don't know for sure which one though.  
"
"Eve started with the red ball. She swapped with Alice, so she got the black ball. Then she swapped with Dave, then Claire, then Bob.  

Eve ended up with the **(B) black ball**.

Hmm...  I can't figure it out.  



"
"Let's see... Bob and Dave swapped, then Bob and Claire swapped, then Dave and Claire swapped, then Claire and Bob swapped...  That's a lot of swapping!  

It sounds like they kept trading the same books back and forth.  Claire probably ended up with the book she started with.  


So the answer is **(D) Ulysses**. 

"
"Let's see...

* Alice starts at fullback, then switches with Bob, then with Claire, then with Claire again, and finally with Eve. 

That means Alice ended up in Eve's spot!  Eve was the benchwarmer.


So the answer is **(B) benchwarmer**. 

"
"Let's see... Claire started with The Fellowship of the Ring. She swapped with Alice, then with Bob.  

* Claire had The Fellowship, then The Pearl, then...  I dunno, I can't keep track of all that!  



"
"Let's see... Dave and Eve switched, then Bob and Claire switched, then Bob and Eve switched again...  That's a lot of switching!  

At the end, Bob was with...  hmm...  I can't keep track of all that switching.

"Let's see...

* Claire and Alice swap: Claire gets the brown ball, Alice gets the black ball.
* Bob and Alice swap: Bob gets the black ball, Alice gets the purple ball.
* Eve and Dave swap: Eve gets the green ball, Dave gets the yellow ball.
* Dave and Claire swap: Dave gets the black ball, Claire gets the yellow ball.
* Alice and Bob swap: Alice gets the purple ball, Bob gets the black ball.

So in the end, Dave has the **(A) black ball**. 


"
"Let's see... Claire and Dave swapped, then Bob and Claire swapped, then Claire and Dave swapped again... that means Claire and Dave probably still have the same things they started with.  

Then Alice and Eve swapped, so Eve has Alice's yellow present now.  

Finally, Claire and Bob swapped, so...  Eve has the **(D) yellow present**. 



"
"Let's see... Claire and Eve swapped, then Dave and Bob swapped, then Claire and Bob swapped, then Eve and Bob swapped, and finally Dave and Alice swapped.

"
"Let's see... Eve and Alice swapped, then Bob and Eve swapped, then Claire and Dave swapped...

The answer is **(D) The Fellowship of the Ring**. 
"
"Let's see... Claire and Alice swapped, then Claire and Dave swapped, then Alice and Bob swapped, then Eve and Dave swapped, and finally Bob and Claire swapped.  

That's a lot of swapping!  It's hard to keep track.  

Hmm... I dunno.  I can't figure out what color present Alice has at the end. 



"
"Let's see...  

* Alice had yellow, then got green.
* Bob had orange, then got purple, then got green.
* Claire had red, then got green.
* Dave had purple, then got orange, then got yellow.
* Eve had green, then got yellow, then red, then purple.

So at the end, Dave has the **(A) yellow present**. 



"

"Let's see... Bob started with Sam, then danced with Eve, then back to Sam, then Alice, and then...  I dunno, it's too confusing!  



"
"Let's see... Dave and Eve switched, then Dave and Claire switched, then Dave and Eve switched again.  That means Dave is back where he started, as the striker.  

Then Bob and Alice switched, and Eve and Alice switched.  That means Bob is now on the bench!


So the answer is **(E) benchwarmer**. 

"
"Let's see...  Bob started with blue, then got yellow, then blue again, then yellow, then brown.  So Eve has the **(E) blue ball**. 



"
"Let's see... Claire had the blue ball, then she swapped with Bob, so she had the brown ball. Then she swapped with Alice, so Alice had the brown ball.  

Dave started with the yellow ball and swapped with Eve, so he has the purple ball now. 


So the answer is **(D) purple ball**.

"Let's see... Claire and Bob switched, then Claire and Eve switched, then Bob and Dave switched...  That's a lot of switching!  

At the end, Bob was with...  Hmm, I can't keep track of all that.  



"
"Let's see... Eve and Alice swapped, then Claire and Bob swapped, then Alice and Bob swapped...  

That's a lot of swapping!  I can't keep track of it all.  



"
"Let's see... Eve started with the blue ball. She traded with Alice, so Alice had the blue ball. Then Eve got the red ball from Claire.  Then Eve traded back with Alice, so Alice had the blue ball again.  

Bob and Claire traded, so Bob got the red ball.  

Dave traded with Alice last, so Dave got the blue ball. 


So the answer is (C). 
"
"Let's see... Dave and Alice switched, then Eve and Bob switched, then Claire and Dave switched, then Alice and Eve switched, and finally Alice and Bob switched again.  

That's a lot of switching!  

Claire started as the left winger, and she didn't switch with anyone in the last few swaps. So Claire must still be the left winger. 


**The answer is (B).** 

"
"Let's see... Bob started with pink, then got brown, then got red, then got pink again, then got yellow.  So Bob has the **(D) yellow ball**. 



"
"Let's see...  Bob had the black ball, then he swapped with Dave who had the purple one.  Then Bob got the yellow one from Eve.  Then he swapped back with Dave...  

Hmm, that's a lot of swapping!  I can't keep track of it all.  



"
"Let's see... Claire started as striker, then she switched with Eve, then Dave, then Alice.  So Claire is probably playing cheerleader now. 


**Answer: (E)** 
"
"Let's see... Eve and Dave swapped, then Alice and Dave swapped, then Alice and Claire swapped...  

That means Claire probably has the ball that was originally Dave's.  Dave started with the red ball, so Claire has the **(D) red ball**. 



"
"Let's see... Claire and Bob swapped, then Claire and Dave swapped, then Dave and Alice swapped, then Dave and Bob swapped, and finally Eve and Dave swapped.

Hmm...  I don't know who Eve ended up with.  



"
"Let's see... Claire and Bob switched, then Dave and Alice switched, then Dave and Bob switched again...  That's a lot of switching!  

Eve started with Jamie, then switched with Alice, and then with Claire.  

So Eve is dancing with **(C) Rodrigo**. 



"
"Let's see...  

* Alice and Bob swap, so Alice has Ulysses and Bob has Frankenstein.
* Alice and Eve swap, so Alice has Lolita and Eve has Frankenstein.
* Bob and Eve swap, so Bob has Frankenstein and Eve has Ulysses.
* Dave and Bob swap, so Dave has Frankenstein and Bob has The Pearl.
* Bob and Claire swap, so Claire has The Pearl and Bob has The Odyssey.


So the answer is **(C) The Pearl**. 
"
"Let's see... Claire and Bob swapped, then Claire and Alice swapped, then Claire and Eve swapped...  

That means Claire had Bob's book for a while, then Alice's book, then Eve's book.  

Eve started with Catch-22, and she swapped with Claire last. So Eve must have **(A) Lolita** at the end. 



"
"Let's see... Dave and Alice switched, then Eve and Alice switched... that means Alice is dancing with Eve now.  

Then Bob and Dave switched, and then Bob and Eve switched... so Bob is dancing with Alice now.

Finally, Bob and Claire switched... so Claire is dancing with...  **(D) Karl**. 



"
"Let's see... Dave started as a left winger. Then he switched with Claire, who was the goalie.  

After that, things get a little mixed up with Alice and Eve swapping back and forth. But the important thing is Dave is no longer a left winger.  He's the goalie now!


So the answer is **(E) goalkeeper**. 

"
"Let's see... Dave had the purple one, then he swapped with Bob.  So Bob had the purple one for a bit. Then Bob swapped with Eve, so Eve has the purple one now.  

Bob must have the **(B) yellow present**.

I dunno, it's hard to keep track of all that.

"
"Let's see... Eve danced with Bob, then Bob danced with Alice, then Eve danced with Dave...  

*Eve danced with a lot of people!*  

Hmm...  I can't keep track of it all.  



"
"Let's see... Dave and Eve switched, then Dave and Alice switched, then Eve and Alice switched again...  That means Dave and Eve are back to switchin' partners with each other.  

Then Claire and Bob switched.  

Finally, Dave and Alice switched again.  

So, Eve is dancin' with... **(D) Lola**. 



"
"Let's see... Claire had the green one, then she swapped with Bob, so Bob had the green one. Then Claire got Dave's red one...  

Hmm, it's getting confusing.  I dunno, I can't keep track of all that swapping! 



"
"Let's see... Claire and Bob swapped, then Claire and Alice swapped, then Dave and Claire swapped...  

That means Dave ended up with Claire's book. Claire started with The Fellowship of the Ring, so Dave has that one. 


The answer is **(E) The Fellowship of the Ring**. 

"
"Let's see...  

* Alice had pink, then got Dave's orange ball.
* Dave had orange, then got Eve's black ball.
* Dave then got Alice's pink ball back.
* Bob and Claire swapped, so Claire now has Bob's red present.

So the answer is **(A) red present**. 


"
"Let's see...  

* Bob and Alice swap:  Bob gets the green, Alice gets the white.
* Alice and Eve swap: Alice gets the yellow, Eve gets the green.
* Claire and Eve swap: Claire gets the yellow, Eve gets the black.
* Alice and Dave swap: Alice gets the orange, Dave gets the yellow.

"
"Let's see... Claire and Alice switched, then Eve and Alice switched...  That means Alice was with Eve for a bit. Then Claire and Dave switched, and Dave and Bob switched.  Whew, that's a lot of switching!  

At the end, Alice and Claire switched again.  So Alice is probably with **(B) Lola**. 



"
"Let's see... Claire and Dave swapped, then Dave and Alice swapped, then Bob and Claire swapped...  

That's a lot of swapping!  I can't keep track of it all.

* She swapped with Bob at the end.
* So Eve is now the... **(E) striker**. 


"
"Let's see... Dave started in the middle, then switched with Eve, then with Bob, then with Claire, and then with Bob again.  

That's a lot of switching!  

I think Dave is probably playing **(C) cheerleader** now. 



"
"Let's see... Claire started with a white ball. She traded with Dave, so she got his black ball. Then she traded with Alice, so she got Alice's yellow ball. Then she traded with Eve, so Eve got the yellow ball.

**So the answer is (A).** 

"
"Let's see... Eve and Claire switched, then Bob and Eve switched, then Bob and Dave switched...  That means Dave is dancing with Bob's partner now.  Bob was dancing with Ophelia, so Dave is dancing with Ophelia! 

The answer is **(B)**.

"
"Let's see... Eve starts with the brown ball. She trades with Alice, so now Eve has the white ball. Then Dave and Bob trade, but that don't change Eve's ball.  Claire and Alice trade, still no change for Eve. Then Alice and Dave trade, and Eve is back to having the white ball.  

Eve ends up with the **(D) white ball**. 



"
"Let's see... Eve started with yellow, then she swapped with Claire who had blue.  Then Eve swapped with Alice who had black.  So Eve has the black ball now.  

Dave started with green and swapped with Bob who had brown.  

So Dave still has the green ball. 


The answer is **(B) green ball**. 

"
"Let's see...

* Bob started on the bench, then he was a right winger, then he was back on the bench, then he was a goalkeeper. 

* Eve started as a cheerleader, then she was a right winger.

So Eve is the right winger at the end! 


**Answer: (A)** 
"

But Eve started with Jamie, so Dave must be dancing with Jamie now! 


**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Let's see... Dave started with Ulysses. He swapped with Eve, then Bob, then Bob again, then Bob one more time.

It's hard to keep track of who has what after all that.  I'm not good with remembering all those details. 



"
"Let's see... Eve swapped with Claire first, then Alice, then Bob, and then Alice again.  That means Eve probably has Alice's book now.  

Bob swapped with Alice, then Eve, and then Dave.  So Bob probably has Dave's book now.

Dave must have Bob's book at the end.  


Bob started with The Odyssey, so Dave must have **(E) The Odyssey**.

"Let's see... Dave and Eve swapped, then Bob and Claire swapped, then Claire and Alice swapped, then Dave and Eve swapped again, and finally Eve and Claire swapped.  

Eve started with the green ball.  She swapped with Dave, then Claire, then Dave again, then Claire.  That means Eve probably still has the green ball. 


**So the answer is (E).** 

"
"Let's see... Bob started with yellow, then he swapped with Alice who had orange.  Then he swapped with Dave, then back with Alice again, and finally with Claire.  

That's a lot of swapping!  I think Bob has the **(B) orange ball** now. 



"
"Let's see... Dave and Alice swapped, then Alice and Claire swapped, then Claire and Bob swapped...  

*starts counting on fingers*

That's three swaps!  Bob must have the orange ball now. 


**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Let's see...  Alice switched with Claire, then Dave and Claire switched, then Dave and Bob switched...  That's a lot of switching!  

At the end, Dave was dancing with Eve.  

Hmm... I can't remember who Alice was dancing with at the very end.  



"
"Let's see... Claire and Alice switched, then Alice and Dave switched, then Alice and Bob switched...  That's a lot of switching!  

At the end, Dave was with Bob, and then they switched again.  So Dave must be with... **(D) Patrick**. 



"
"Let's see... Claire had the orange ball, and she swapped with Alice who had the brown present. Then Dave swapped with Bob, but that don't really matter 'cause they swapped balls, not presents.  

Claire and Alice swapped again, so Claire probably has the brown present now.  Then Eve and Alice swapped, so Alice must have the black ball. 

Dave must have the **(D) orange ball**. 



"
"Let's see... Claire danced with Bob, then Alice, then Bob again, then Eve, and finally Dave.  That's a lot of switching!  

Bob must be dancing with whoever he was with last.  He was with Eve last, so...

Bob is dancing with **(C) Karl**. 



"
"Let's see... Dave and Eve switched, then Dave and Bob switched, then Dave and Claire switched, then Dave and Bob switched again, and finally Alice and Bob switched.  

That's a lot of switching!  

At the end, Bob was playing... **(C) goalkeeper**. 



"
"Let's see... Eve and Claire swapped, then Alice and Bob swapped, then Dave and Alice swapped, then Bob and Dave swapped, and finally Eve and Bob swapped.  

That's a lot of swapping!  It's hard to keep track of who has what.  

Hmm...  I can't figure it out.  



"
"Let's see... Eve and Alice swapped, then Alice and Bob swapped, then Claire and Bob swapped...  

That means Claire probably got a book from Bob.  

Hmm...  I can't remember who had what after all those swaps.  



"
"Let's see...

* Alice started as striker, then was goalie, then cheerleader, then back to striker.
* Dave started on the bench, then was fullback, then striker, then goalie.

So at the end, Dave is the **(A) goalkeeper**. 



"
"Let's see... Eve and Alice switched, then Dave and Claire switched, then Eve and Claire switched again...  That's a lot of switching!  

At the end, Dave was with... Melissa!  



"
"Let's see... Dave and Alice switched, then Claire and Dave switched, then Alice and Dave switched again... that's a lot of switching!  Then Bob and Eve switched, and finally Bob and Alice switched.  

Hmm...  I can't keep track of all that!  



"
"Let's see... Claire and Eve switched, then Claire and Dave switched, then Eve and Claire switched again... that means Claire is back where she started, right?  And then Claire and Alice switched, so Alice is probably playing striker now. 


**Answer: (E) striker** 
"
"Let's see... Dave and Bob switched, then Claire and Dave switched... that means Dave is dancing with Claire now.  Then Eve and Alice switched, and Claire and Eve switched...  

That means Eve is dancing with...  **(C) Jamie**. 



"
"Let's see... Eve and Alice switched, then Alice and Dave switched, then Eve and Alice switched again.  That means Alice is back in the right midfielder spot.  Then Dave and Claire switched, so Claire is now the left winger. 


So the answer is **(B) left winger**. 
"
"Let's see... Claire started with the orange ball.  She swapped with Eve, then Bob, then Bob again, and finally Alice.  

That means Claire probably still has the orange ball. 


**So the answer is (C).** 

"
"Let's see... Eve started with The Odyssey. She swapped with Bob, so now she has Moby Dick.  Then, things get mixed up a bit, but in the end, Eve ends up with  **(C) Moby Dick**. 



"
"Let's see... Eve and Bob swapped, then Dave and Alice swapped, then Bob and Claire swapped, then Alice and Dave swapped again, and finally Claire and Bob swapped.  That's a lot of swapping!  

It's hard to keep track of who has what after all that.  



"
"Let's see... Claire started with Helga. Then she danced with Eve, then Dave, then Alice, and then back to Dave.  

So Claire ended up with **(C) Patrick**. 



"
"Let's see...  Alice started with yellow, then got green, then purple, then back to yellow.  So the answer is **(D) yellow present**. 


"
"Let's see... Eve started as a left midfielder. 

* She switched with Bob, so she was a striker for a bit.
* Then she switched with Dave, so she was a right midfielder.
* Next, she switched with Alice, so she was a right winger.
* Then she switched with Claire, so she was a cheerleader.

So at the end, Eve was a **(D) cheerleader**. 



"
"Let's see... Dave and Eve switched, then Eve and Claire switched, then Alice and Dave switched...  That means Eve is dancing with Dave now.  Then Eve and Claire switched again, so Eve is back with Claire.  Finally, Eve and Bob switched.  

So Bob is dancing with Eve at the end. 



"
"Let's see... Dave started with a black ball, then swapped with Claire who had the white present.  Then Dave swapped with Eve who had the orange ball.  So Dave ended up with the orange ball.  

After that, Claire had the black ball.  


So the answer is (C). 

"
"Let's see... Claire had the blue ball, then she swapped with Bob, so she had the brown ball. Then she swapped with Alice, so Alice had the brown ball.  Then Dave and Eve swapped, that don't matter for Alice. Then Bob and Alice swapped, so Alice has the blue ball now.  Then Claire and Alice swapped again, so Alice has the **(C) blue ball**. 



"
"Let's see... Dave started as a fullback, then he switched with Claire, then with Bob, then with Eve, and finally with Alice.  

That means Dave ended up in the same spot as Alice at the end.  Alice was the cheerleader at the start, so Dave must be the cheerleader now!


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Let's see... Bob started with Hound of the Baskervilles. He swapped with Alice, then Dave, then Eve, and then Dave again.  

That's a lot of swapping!  I can't keep track of it all.  



"
"Let's see...

* Alice started on the bench.
* Eve started on the left wing.
* They switched, so Alice was on the wing and Eve was on the bench.
* Then Alice and Claire switched, so Alice was cheering and Eve was on the wing again.
* Then Alice and Eve switched again, so Eve was cheering and Alice was on the wing.
* Then Bob and Dave switched, so Bob was up front and Dave was on the side.
* Finally, Dave and Eve switched, so Dave was on the wing and Eve was up front.

So, Bob ended up as the striker! 


**The answer is (D).** 

"
"Let's see... Claire and Dave switched, then Eve and Bob switched, then Claire and Alice switched, then Eve and Alice switched, and then Claire and Dave switched again.  

That's a lot of switching!  

Hmm... I can't keep track of who's with who anymore.  



"
"Let's see...  

* Claire and Alice swap:  Claire gets the green one, Alice gets the red one.
* Bob and Eve swap: Bob gets the purple one, Eve gets the blue one.
* Alice and Dave swap: Alice gets the yellow one, Dave gets the red one.
* Bob and Dave swap: Bob gets the yellow one, Dave gets the purple one.
* Dave and Eve swap: Dave gets the blue one, Eve gets the purple one.

So in the end, Eve has the **(C) purple present**. 



"
"Let's see... Dave started with the black ball. He swapped with Claire, so now he has the brown ball. Then he swapped with Eve, so Eve has the black ball now.  

So the answer is (C). 


"
"Let's see... Dave and Bob switched, then Eve and Claire switched, then Eve and Bob switched again...  That's a lot of switching!  

In the end, Eve was playing...  I dunno, I can't keep track of all that!  



"
"Let's see... Dave swapped with a lot of folks!  

* First, he got Alice's white present.
* Then he got Claire's yellow present.
* Then he gave his purple present to Eve.
* Then he got Bob's green present.
* And finally, he gave his yellow present back to Claire.

So, Eve ended up with Dave's purple present! 


**Answer: (E)** 
"
"Let's see... Bob and Dave switched, then Claire and Bob switched, then Eve and Dave switched, then Claire and Alice switched, and finally Dave and Alice switched.  That's a lot of switching!  

My head is spinning!  I can't keep track of who's with who anymore.  



"
"Let's see...

* Dave and Bob switched, then Alice and Claire switched, then Claire and Eve switched, then Bob and Claire switched again, and finally Dave and Eve switched.  

That's a lot of switching!  It's hard to keep track.  But in the end, Claire ended up where she started. 


So the answer is **(C) right winger**. 

"
"Let's see... Bob and Alice swapped, then Eve and Claire swapped, then Bob and Alice swapped again...  That means Alice probably has The Great Gatsby now, and Bob has Lolita.  

Eve and Claire swapped, then Claire and Eve swapped again, so they must have switched back to their original books.  

So Claire probably has **(E) Ulysses**. 



"
"Let's see... Claire and Dave swapped, then Bob and Claire swapped, then Dave and Alice swapped...  That's a lot of swapping!  

Hmm, I can't keep track of all that.  



"
"Let's see... Eve started with a pink ball. She swapped with Alice, so now Eve has the green present. Then she swapped with Claire, so now Eve has the white present. 

So the answer is **(D) white present**. 



"
"Let's see... Bob started with Lola. Then he danced with Eve, then Alice, then Claire, and now...  I think he's with Izzi! 


**So the answer is (D).** 

"
"Let's see... Claire and Alice switched, then Eve and Alice switched... that means Claire is dancing with Eve now, and Alice is dancing with Izzi.  

Then Claire and Dave switched, so now Claire is dancing with Dave, and Alice is still with Izzi.

Then Dave and Bob switched, so now Dave is dancing with Karl, and Bob is with...  whoever Dave was with before!

Finally, Claire and Alice switched again, but that doesn't change who Dave is dancing with.


So the answer is **(B) Karl**. 

"
"Let's see... Claire had the green one, and she swapped with Alice. So Alice has the green one now. 


The answer is **(A) green present**. 
"
"Let's see...

* Bob starts with brown, then he trades with Alice who had the black ball. So Bob has the black ball now.
* Then Alice trades with Claire who had the red ball.  
* Eve trades with Alice, but that doesn't change what Bob has.
* Claire trades with Bob again, so Bob gets the red ball.

So the answer is **(B) red ball**. 



"
"Let's see...

* Claire and Dave switched, so Dave was a right winger for a bit.
* Then Dave and Bob switched, so Bob was a fullback.
* Then Alice and Bob switched, so Bob was a cheerleader.
* Then Eve and Dave switched, so Dave was a right midfielder.
* Finally, Alice and Dave switched, so Bob stayed a cheerleader.


So the answer is **(E) cheerleader**. 
"
"Let's see... Eve started with the blue present.  She swapped with Bob, then Dave, then Bob again.  That means she probably still has the blue one! 

So the answer is **(A) blue present**. 



"
"Let's see...

* Alice starts at fullback, then she switches with Bob, then with Claire, then with Bob again, and finally with Eve.  
* Bob starts as right winger, then switches with Alice, then with Dave, then with Claire, and then... I dunno, I lost track.

* Claire starts in the middle, then switches with Alice, then with Bob, and then...  

It's all mixed up!  I can't keep up with all the switching.  



"
"Let's see... Claire and Eve swapped, then Dave and Alice swapped, then Alice and Bob swapped, then Claire and Bob swapped, and finally Bob and Dave swapped.  

That's a lot of swapping!  It's hard to keep track of who has what.  

Hmm...  I can't figure it out.  



"
"Let's see... Eve had the pink ball, and she swapped with Alice who had the green thing. So now Eve has the green thing.  

Then Dave and Bob swapped, but I don't know what they had.  

Claire and Dave swapped, so now Claire has what Dave had.

Eve and Claire swapped, so now Eve has what Claire had.

Finally, Bob and Dave swapped again.  

Hmm... I can't keep track of it all.  



"
"Let's see... Claire started as the goalie, then she switched with Eve, then with Dave, then with Alice, and finally with Dave again.  

That's a lot of switching!  I think Claire is probably the **(E) left winger** now. 



"
"Let's see... Eve swapped with a lot of people.  She must have ended up with The Odyssey 'cause that's the last one Alice swapped.  Dave got the book Alice had. 


So the answer is **(D) The Odyssey**. 

"
"Let's see... Claire danced with a lot of folks!  She started with Melissa, then Bob, then Eve, then Bob again, and finally Alice.  Dave switched with Eve, so he must be dancing with... Eve's partner!  Eve started with Patrick, so Dave is dancing with Patrick. 


**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Let's see... Dave and Eve switched, then Bob and Claire switched, then Bob and Eve switched again...  That's a lot of switching!  

Claire and Alice switched last, so Claire is probably with Alice's old partner now.  Alice was with Jamie, so...


Claire is dancing with **(B) Jamie**. 

"
"Let's see... Bob started with a white ball. He swapped with Dave, then Eve, then Claire.

Alice swapped with Dave, so now Alice has the yellow one.

Bob and Dave swapped, so now Bob has the... yellow one?

Dave and Eve swapped, so now Dave has the... purple one.

So Bob has the yellow one! 


**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Let's see... Bob and Dave swapped, then Eve and Alice swapped, then Bob and Dave swapped again...  

That means Dave probably still has the red ball. 


**So the answer is (A).**

Eve is playing **(E) striker**. 

"
"Let's see...  Bob and Dave swapped, then Bob and Eve swapped, then Bob and Dave swapped again.  That means Bob and Dave keep switching back and forth!  

Eve swapped with Alice last, so Alice must have Eve's present now. Eve started with the orange ball, so Alice has the orange ball. 


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Let's see...

* Alice and Bob switched, so Bob was striker.
* Eve and Dave switched, but that doesn't change where Bob is.
* Alice and Dave switched, but that doesn't change where Bob is either.

So Bob ended up as the **(A) striker**. 



"
"Let's see... Bob and Dave swapped, then Bob and Claire swapped, then Dave and Claire swapped, and then Bob and Claire swapped again.  That means Bob and Claire probably ended up with each other's books in the end.  

Alice and Eve swapped, so Alice probably has Eve's book now. Eve started with Moby Dick, so Alice must have Moby Dick.

Then Bob and Dave switched, so Bob is dancing with Dave now.  

And then Bob and Eve switched, so Bob is dancing with Eve now.

Finally, Bob and Claire switched, so Bob is dancing with Claire now.

That means Eve is dancing with... **(D) Helga**. 



"
"Let's see... Eve started with the green ball. She swapped with Bob, then Alice, then Bob again.  

* Eve starts with green, swaps with Bob, so she has blue.
* Swaps with Alice, so she has yellow.

So the answer is **(E) blue ball**. 
"
"Let's see... Dave and Alice switched, then Claire and Dave switched, then Alice and Dave switched again... that's a lot of switching!  Then Bob and Eve switched, and finally Bob and Alice switched.  

Hmm... that's all the switching.  Claire must be with whoever she was with at the very end.  

Claire started with Sam, so she's probably still with Sam. 


**Answer: (D) Sam** 

"
"Let's see... Eve started with Rodrigo, then danced with Bob, then Claire, and now...  I dunno, I can't keep track of all that!  



"
"Let's see...

* Eve and Bob swap: Eve gets the green, Bob gets the red.
* Bob and Dave swap: Bob gets the black ball, Dave gets the red.

"
"Let's see... Dave swapped with a lot of folks!  

* Dave started with purple.
* He swapped with Alice (white), then Claire (yellow), then Eve (pink), then Bob (green), and finally Claire again.

**So the answer is (B).** 

"
"Let's see...

* Claire and Alice swap:  Alice gets the black ball, Claire gets the brown ball.
* Bob and Alice swap: Alice gets the purple ball, Bob gets the brown ball.
* Eve and Dave swap: Eve gets the green ball, Dave gets the yellow ball.
* Dave and Claire swap: Claire gets the green ball, Dave gets the black ball.
* Alice and Bob swap: Alice gets the brown ball, Bob gets the purple ball.

So in the end, Bob has the **(D) purple ball**. 


"
"Let's see... Bob started with the blue ball.  He swapped with Claire, then Claire swapped with Dave, then back with Claire, then with Bob again, and finally with Eve.  

That means Bob ended up with Eve's ball!  


So the answer is **(C) brown ball**. 

"
"Let's see... Bob started with purple, then he swapped with Claire, then Dave, then Claire again, then Alice, then Eve.  

That's a lot of swapping!  I bet Alice has the purple ball now. 


**So the answer is (A).** 

"
"Let's see... Eve starts with Lolita, then swaps with Alice, then with Claire, then with Alice again, then with Dave.  

That means Eve probably has Dave's book now.  

So the answer is **(C) The Great Gatsby**. 



"
"Let's see... Dave and Eve switched, then Alice and Claire switched, then Dave and Bob switched, then Alice and Eve switched again, and finally Eve and Dave switched again.  

That's a lot of switching!  It's hard to keep track.  

Hmm...  I think Eve ended up with **(B) Helga**. 



"
"Let's see... Dave started with the white ball.  He swapped with Alice, then Claire, then Bob, then Alice again.  That's a lot of swapping!  

Hmm... I can't keep track of it all.  



"
"Let's see...  Bob started with Patrick. Then he danced with Alice, then with Alice again, then with Eve.  So Bob ended up with Eve's partner.  

Bob ended up with **(B) Rodrigo**. 



"
"Let's see...  Bob started with white, then got pink, then orange, then white again, and finally red.  

So the answer is **(A) red ball**. 



"
"Let's see...  Bob and Claire swapped, then Eve and Alice swapped, then Bob and Claire swapped again...  That's a lot of swapping!  

I dunno, it's hard to keep track of all that.  



"
"Let's see... Eve started with the orange ball, and she swapped with Alice first. Then they swapped again at the end. So Eve must have the purple present now. 


Claire started with the white present.  She swapped with Eve, so Claire must have the orange ball now. 


So the answer is **(E) orange ball**. 

"
"Let's see... Eve and Claire switched, then Alice and Dave switched, then Claire and Bob switched...  That's a lot of switching!  

*Eve and Claire switched*  
*Alice and Dave switched*
*Claire and Bob switched*
*Eve and Alice switched*
*Claire and Eve switched*

Hmm...  I can't keep track of all that.  

But, I know Bob started as a fullback.  


**So the answer is (D) fullback.** 

"
"Let's see... Dave started as a left winger, then he switched with Bob, then with Claire, then back with Claire, and finally with Alice.  

That means Dave is probably back where he started! So the answer is **(D) left winger**. 



"
"Let's see... Eve and Bob swapped, so Bob has the green ball now. Then Dave and Claire swapped, so Bob still has the green ball.  Alice and Eve swapped, so Bob still has the green ball. Then Alice and Dave swapped, so Bob still has the green ball.  Finally, Bob and Alice swapped, so Bob has the yellow ball. 

So the answer is **(D) yellow ball**. 



"
"Let's see... Claire started with the white ball. She traded with Dave, so Dave got the white ball. Then Claire got Alice's yellow ball.  

After that, Eve gave Claire her purple ball.  Then Dave traded his white ball for Bob's pink ball.  Finally, Alice and Bob swapped, so Dave ended up with the pink ball. 


So the answer is **(A) pink ball**. 
"
"Let's see where Dave ends up!

* **Start:** Dave is center midfielder.
* **Trade 1:** Gertrude and Dave trade. Now Dave is goalkeeper.
* **Trade 2:** Bob and Dave trade. Now Dave is **right midfielder**.
