"Let's figure this out!

* **Golfer is in house 1:**  We know this for sure.
* **Swimmer is left of the romance lover:**  This means they can't be in house 4.

We know daffodils aren't in house 2, so they can't be in house 3 or 4.

"This is a tricky puzzle!  

Let's try to solve it step-by-step using the clues.  

I can't give you the exact answer without drawing a picture and figuring out where everyone lives, but I can tell you this:

* **We know some things for sure:**
    * The history book buff lives in house number 2.
    * The fantasy book enthusiast lives in house number 4.

* **We can use the clues to figure out who lives near each other.** For example, we know the person with the rose bouquet lives next to the person who likes yellow.

"Let's try to figure this out!

* **Clue 2:** The flutist is to the right of the violinist.
* **Clue 3:** There's one house between the grape eater and the kiwi eater.
* **Clue 4:** There's one house between the violinist and the kiwi eater.

Hmm... this is tricky!  Let me think... 



"
"Here's how we can solve this:

* We know the kiwi eater lives in house 1.
* We know the fantasy book lover doesn't live in house 1. 

So the fantasy book lover must live in house 2! 

The answer is **(B) 2**. 


"
"The answer is **(D) 3**. 

Here's why:

Clue 8 says the person who likes red lives in the third house.  


"
"Here's how we can solve this:

* **Clue 1:** The root beer lover doesn't live in house 2.
* **Clue 2:** The pianist lives to the left of the cellist.

Since we know the root beer lover isn't in house 2, they must live in house 1. 


**Answer: (A) 1** 
"
"Let's use the clues to figure out where everyone lives!

* **Clue 7** tells us the person with carnations lives in house 5.
* **Clue 1** says boots and carnations are next to each other, so boots must be in house 4.
* **Clue 2** says tulips are to the left of loafers.
* **Clue 6** says tulips aren't in house 4.

Putting those together, tulips must be in house 3 and loafers in house 4.

* **Clue 8** says daffodils and running shoes are next to each other. 
* **Clue 5** says tulips are to the right of daffodils.

This means daffodils and running shoes must be in houses 1 and 2.

* **Clue 3** says sandals aren't in house 5.

That leaves house 5 for sandals.

Now we know:

1. Daffodils
2. Running shoes
3. Tulips
4. Boots
5. Carnations

**So the person with lilies must live in house 2!**

"Here's how we can solve this puzzle:

* **Start with what we know for sure:**

    * The person with the rose bouquet lives in house number 2.
    * The person with the rose bouquet lives next to the science fiction book fanatic.

* **Use the clues to figure out the rest:**

    * Clue 1 tells us the fantasy book enthusiast is to the left of the science fiction fan. Since the rose bouquet is next to the science fiction fan, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 1.
    * Clue 3 says the romance book lover is directly left of the tulips.
    * Clue 2 says the romance book lover is to the right of the carnations.

* **Putting it all together:**

    * House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast, Rose bouquet
    * House 2: Rose bouquet, Science fiction book fanatic
    * House 3:  Romance book lover, Tulips
    * House 4: Carnations, Lilies 



**So the answer is (C) 4** 
"
"Here's how we can solve this:

* **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker is to the left of the sandals wearer.
* **Clue 2:** The science fiction fan lives in house 1.

Since the science fiction fan is in house 1, they can't be the coffee drinker or the sandals wearer.

"
"Here's how we can solve this:

"Here's how we can solve this:

Since we know house 2 is the kiwi house, and the water drinker can't be in house 2, the water drinker must be in house 1.  

**Therefore, the high heel wearer must live in house 2.**


The answer is **(B) 2**.

"Let's figure this out!

* **Clue 3:** Tea drinker is to the left of the TV person.

Hmm...  I think the person with the grapes and sandals must live in house 1 because clue 2 says they are next to each other.  

Since high heels are to the left of sandals, the person with high heels must live in house 1 too! 

That means the person eating kiwis must live in **house 2**.

* **Clue 2** says the person who likes green and the person who likes red live next to each other.

Putting those clues together, it seems like the red and green people are together, and the white person is somewhere before them.

* **Clue 4** says the person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.

This means the order has to be something like this:

Green - Yellow - Red - White

We know grapes are in house 2, so it can't be the green person.  

Since the person who likes red lives to the right of the person eating kiwis, and the red person is in the order, the kiwi person must be in house 1.

"
"Here's how we can figure this out:

* **Clue 4 tells us the soccer player lives in house 2.** 

* **Clue 1 says the blue lover lives to the left of the root beer lover.**  Since the soccer player is in house 2, the blue lover must be in house 1.

* **Clue 3 says the root beer lover is to the right of the grilled cheese eater.**  

Since the blue lover is in house 1, the root beer lover must be in **house 2**.




**So the answer is (B).** 
"
"Let's try to solve this puzzle! 

Here's what we know so far:

* **House 2:**  Has daffodils.
* **Soccer player:** Not in houses 1 or 4.
* **Cricketer:** To the right of the soccer player.
* **Green:** To the left of the swimmer.
* **Lilies:** To the right of the swimmer.
* **Yellow:** Directly left of daffodils (house 2).
* **Red:** Directly left of lilies.
* **Tulips and Baseball:** Next to each other.
* **White:** Not in house 2.

"
"Here's how we can figure this out:

* We know the violinist lives in house number 1.
* We also know the computer person lives to the left of the bird keeper.

That means the bird keeper must live in **house 2**.


So the answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Let's use the clues to figure this out!

"Here's how we can solve this puzzle:

* **Clue 4:** The SUV owner lives to the left of the person in house 2 (who wears boots). 
* **Clue 3:** The sedan owner lives in house 3.
* **Clue 5:** The cat lover lives in house 1.

Let's put it all together:

* **House 1:** Cat lover 
* **House 2:** Boots
* **House 3:** Sedan

Now we know the person in house 2 wears boots and the person in house 3 drives a sedan.  

* **Clue 2:** The high heels wearer lives to the left of the dog owner.  Since we don't know where the dog owner lives yet, we can't figure out where the high heels wearer lives.

* **Clue 4:** The SUV owner lives to the left of the boots wearer (house 2). This means the SUV owner must live in house 1.

Since we know who lives in houses 1, 2, and 3, the person wearing running shoes must live in **house 3**.




**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Here's how we can solve this puzzle:

* **Clue 4:** The person with carnations lives in house 1.
* **Clue 5:** The person with tulips lives in house 2.
* **Clue 7:** The person with running shoes lives in house 1.
* **Clue 1:** The tea drinker lives in house 3.

Now let's look at the clues that tell us about the apples:

* **Clue 3:** The milk drinker and the apple eater live next to each other.

Since we know the houses, we can figure out where the apple eater must live! 


Let me know if you want to try and figure out the rest! 

"
"Here's how we can solve this puzzle:

* **Clue 4 says the mystery book reader lives left of the person with the television.**  This means the person with the television lives in house 3.

* **That leaves house 2 for the science fiction book fanatic!**
