"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

* **Start with the knowns:**

    * Flutist lives in house 2.
    * Tulips are to the left of the guitarist.
    * Lilies are to the left of carnations.
    * One house between the flutist and the pianist.

* **Deduce:**

    * Since the flutist is in house 2, the pianist must be in either house 1 or 3. 
    *  We know lilies are to the left of carnations, so they can't be in house 4.

* **Consider the tulips clue:** Tulips are to the left of the guitarist.  This means the guitarist can't be in house 1 (because there's no house to the left of it).

* **Conclusion:** The guitarist must be in house 4, and the tulips are in house 3.




**Therefore, the answer is (D) 3**

* **Clue 1:** The pianist lives in the first house. 
* **Clue 3:** The person who likes white does not live in the second house.

Let's use a table to keep track:

| 2     |        |         | White |        |            |

Now let's consider Clue 2: ""The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.""  This means the horse owner must live in house 1.

* **Updated Table:**

| House | Person | Pet    | Color | Drink | Instrument |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|--------|------------|
| 1     |        | Horses |       |        | Pianist     |
| 2     |        |         | White |        |            |

We know the dog owner and the root beer lover are still unaccounted for.  Since the root beer lover is to the right of the horse owner, the root beer lover must live in house 2.

* **Updated Table:**

| House | Person | Pet    | Color | Drink | Instrument |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|--------|------------|
| 1     |        | Horses |       |        | Pianist     |
| 2     |        |         | White | Root Beer |            |

This leaves the dog owner and the blue color preference.  

* **Final Table:**

"Let's break down this logic puzzle step-by-step.  I can't give you the exact house number for the swimmer without more information.  

Here's why:

* **Too Many Variables:** We have a lot of information about different characteristics (food, books, shoes, sports, fruit) and their relationships to each other. 
* **Interconnected Clues:** The clues are interconnected.  Solving one clue often gives us information that helps us solve another.

**How to Approach This:**

1. **Create a Grid:** The best way to solve this is to create a grid with the house numbers (1-5) and columns for each characteristic (food, book, shoes, sport, fruit).

2. **Start with the Most Direct Clues:** Look for clues that directly link a characteristic to a specific house number.

3. **Use Deduction:**  Work through the clues, using the information you have to eliminate possibilities and deduce where things must go.

4. **Look for Patterns:**  See if you can find patterns or relationships between the clues. For example, if you know ""X lives to the left of Y,"" you can rule out any houses where the order is reversed.

* **Clue 2:** The golfer lives in the fourth house.
* **Clue 5:** The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
* **Clue 9:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player.

**2. Combine clues:**

"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

* **Clue 2 and 3 tell us:** The violinist lives in house 2. 
* **Clue 2 also tells us:** The basketball player lives in house 2.

Since the violinist and basketball player are the same person, we know:

* **The violinist/basketball player lives in house 2.**

Now let's look at clue 1:

* **Clue 1:** The cellist lives to the right of the cricketer.

This means the cricketer cannot live in house 3 (because there's no house to the right of it).  

Therefore, the cricketer must live in house 1.

**2.  Combine clues:**

* **Clue 4:** The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
* **Clue 7:** The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fourth house.

Since the fourth house is taken, the history book buff and the lilies must be in houses 1 and 2.

**3.  Continue piecing together:**

* **Clue 8:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
* **Clue 9:** The tea drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.

This means the tea drinker can't be in the first house (because the carnations person is to their right).

* **Clue 6:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the first house.

**4. Deduction:**

We know the following:

* House 1: History book buff, Lilies
* House 2:  ?
* House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast
* House 4: Mystery book reader, Water

The only remaining options for the tea drinker are houses 2 or 3.  We know the tea drinker is to the right of the red-lover, and the history book buff is in house 1.  Therefore, the tea drinker must be in **house 2**.

**3.  Deduce further:**

* **Clue 1:** The tulip person lives to the left of the convertible driver. We know the daffodil person is in the third house, so the tulip person must be in the second house.
* **Clue 5:** The sedan owner lives to the right of the carnations person.  We know the minivan driver is in the fifth house, so the sedan owner must be in the third or fourth house.

The social acceptability of wearing an icon depicting crucifixion depends heavily on cultural context, individual beliefs, and the specific design of the icon. 

* **Religious Context:** For some religions, like Christianity, the crucifixion is a central symbol of faith and sacrifice. Wearing an icon depicting it could be a deeply meaningful expression of belief. 

* **Cultural Sensitivity:** In other cultures, the image of crucifixion might be seen as offensive or disrespectful. It's important to be mindful of the potential impact on others.

* **Context of Wear:**  The setting in which the icon is worn also matters. A religious service would likely be more accepting than a secular event.

**Ultimately, it's best to err on the side of caution and consider the potential impact on others before wearing an icon depicting crucifixion.**

"It's impossible to say definitively whether Japanese serfdom had ""higher status"" than English serfdom.  

Here's why:

* **""Status"" is complex:**  What constitutes ""higher status"" is subjective and depends on many factors like economic security, legal rights, social mobility, and even cultural perceptions. 
* **Different systems:** Japanese and English serfdom were distinct systems with different historical contexts, legal frameworks, and social structures.  Direct comparisons are difficult.

**Some points to consider:**

* **Japanese:**  Japanese peasants (often called *ryōmin*) had some land ownership and could theoretically move up the social ladder through service to a lord.
* **English:** English serfs were tied to the land and had limited rights. They were obligated to work for their lord and pay dues.

**Conclusion:**

Rather than focusing on which was ""higher,"" it's more helpful to understand the unique characteristics of each system and how they functioned within their respective societies. 

"
"This question is a bit tricky!  

* **Andrew Johnson** was the **17th President of the United States**.

"It's impossible to say for certain whether any work of literature directly influences someone to commit a crime, including murder.  

While J.D. Salinger's ""The Catcher in the Rye"" is a widely read and influential book, it's important to remember that:

* **Correlation does not equal causation:** Just because some individuals who commit crimes have read a particular book doesn't mean the book caused them to commit the crime. 
* **People are complex:**  There are many factors that contribute to violent behavior, and it's rarely the result of a single influence.

It's more helpful to focus on understanding the complex social and psychological factors that contribute to violence rather than attributing it to specific books.
