"Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

* **Start with the knowns:**

    * Flutist lives in house 2.
    * Tulips are to the left of the guitarist.
    * Lilies are to the left of carnations.
    * One house between the flutist and the pianist.

* **Deduce:**

    * Since the flutist is in house 2, the pianist must be in either house 1 or 3. 
    *  The tulips and guitarist can't be in house 2 (flutist) or house 3 (pianist).

* **Consider the lilies and carnations:** They are together, so they must be in either houses 1 and 2, or houses 3 and 4.

* **The solution:**  The only arrangement that fits all the clues is:

    * House 1: Tulips, Guitarist
    * House 2: Flutist
    * House 3: Pianist
    * House 4: Lilies, Carnations 



**Therefore, the person with the vase of tulips lives in house 1. The answer is (C).**

"Let's break down this logic puzzle!  

While I don't have a favorite color (as a language model, I don't have feelings!), I'm great at solving these kinds of deduction problems.  

Here's how we can approach it:

1. **Start with the most direct clues:**  Look for clues that tell you exactly where someone lives or who is next to whom.

2. **Create a grid:**  It can be helpful to make a grid with the houses numbered 1-5 and columns for each characteristic (device, pet, instrument, car, flowers).

3. **Fill in the grid:**  As you find clues, start filling in the grid.  

4. **Look for patterns and connections:**  See if you can use the clues to deduce relationships between people or objects.

5. **Eliminate possibilities:**  As you fill in the grid, you'll be able to eliminate houses as possibilities for certain people or items.

Let me know if you'd like me to walk through the solution step-by-step, or if you want to try it yourself first!

| 4     |        |        |        |         |        |

**3.  Deduce and Connect**

Now we can use the remaining clues to deduce more information:

* **Clue 2:** The person wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
* **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other.
* **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.

While I don't have a favorite color (as a language model, I don't have feelings!), I'm great at solving these kinds of deduction problems.  

Here's how we can approach it:

1. **Create a Grid:**  It's helpful to set up a grid with the houses numbered 1-5 and columns for each characteristic (flower, instrument, car, book, pet).

2. **Start with the Most Direct Clues:** Look for clues that directly link a characteristic to a specific house number.  For example, clue 11 tells us the daffodil person lives directly left of the cat lover.

3. **Look for Pairs:**  Clues that link two things together (like clue 2, the saxophonist and science fiction fan) are valuable.

4. **Process of Elimination:**  As you fill in your grid, use the clues to eliminate possibilities for each house.

5. **Keep Track:**  Be careful not to jump to conclusions too quickly.  Double-check your work as you go.

* **Deduce:**

Since the percussionist isn't in house 2, and the bird keeper can't be there either, the bird keeper must live in house 1.  

We still have a lot to figure out, but we've made progress!

"Let's break down this logic puzzle!  

While I don't have a favorite color (as a language model, I don't have feelings or preferences), I'm great at solving these kinds of deduction problems. 

Here's how we can approach it:

**1. Set up a Grid:**

It's helpful to create a grid with the following columns:

* House Number
* Person
* Drink
* Food
* Shoes
* Sport

**2. Start Filling in the Grid:**

Use the clues to start filling in the grid.  For example:

* **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker does not live in the fourth house.
* **Clue 2:** The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. 

Continue filling in the grid based on each clue.

**3. Look for Deductions:**

As you fill in the grid, look for opportunities to make deductions. For example, if you know the tea drinker lives to the left of the pizza eater, and you know the pizza eater is in a specific house, you can deduce the tea drinker's house.

**4.  Keep Going:**

Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you have enough information to determine the house number of the tea drinker.

The acceptability of wearing an icon depicting crucifixion varies greatly depending on cultural context, personal beliefs, and the specific design of the icon. 

**Here are some factors to consider:**

* **Religious beliefs:** For some religions, crucifixion is a sacred symbol with deep religious significance. For others, it may be seen as offensive or disrespectful.
* **Cultural norms:** In some cultures, religious symbols are more widely accepted in public than in others.
* **Context:** The setting in which the icon is worn can also influence its acceptability. For example, wearing a crucifixion icon to a religious service might be appropriate, while wearing it to a secular event might be considered inappropriate.
* **Design:** The specific design of the icon can also play a role. A stylized or abstract depiction of crucifixion might be more acceptable than a realistic and graphic one.

**Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide whether or not they feel comfortable wearing an icon depicting crucifixion.** It is important to be mindful of the potential impact of your clothing choices on others and to avoid causing offense.

Oscar Wilde's trial and imprisonment in 1895 for ""gross indecency"" were a product of the social and legal climate of Victorian England.  Laws regarding homosexuality were significantly different then, and societal attitudes were much more intolerant. 

To assess whether his treatment would be considered fair in the US now, we'd need to consider:

* **Current US law:**  While homosexuality is now legal in the US, there are still disparities in legal protections across states.
* **Evolving social norms:**  Public opinion on homosexuality has shifted dramatically since Wilde's time.
* **Due process:**  We'd need to examine the specifics of Wilde's trial to determine if he received a fair hearing and if his rights were violated.

Ultimately, it's a matter of historical and legal analysis, and there's no single, definitive answer.
