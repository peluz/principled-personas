"Well, I know that you can't take the square root of a negative number. So, the stuff inside the square root has to be bigger than or equal to zero. 

Let's see,  $(x-3)^2$ is always bigger than or equal to zero, and $(x-8)^2$ is also always bigger than or equal to zero.  So, we need to make sure that  $(x-3)^2$ is bigger than $(x-8)^2$.

I'm not real good with algebra, but I can see that if $x$ is smaller than 3, then $(x-3)$ will be negative, and squaring it will make it positive. But $(x-8)$ will be even more negative, so squaring it will make it even bigger.

* **Simplify:**  We can write this as:
   $2\sqrt{6}AB = 9C$

* **Think about the numbers:**  We know $A$, $B$, and $C$ are whole numbers.  The left side has a square root of 6, so to make it a whole number, $A$ and $B$ must be chosen so that their product makes 6 a perfect square.

* **Find the factors:** The only way to get a perfect square from 6 is to have $A = 3$ and $B = 2$.

* **Solve for C:**  Now we have:
   $2\sqrt{6} \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = 9C$
   $12\sqrt{6} = 9C$
   $C = \frac{12\sqrt{6}}{9} = \frac{4\sqrt{6}}{3}$

* **Add it all up:** Since $C$ isn't a whole number, we need to think about it differently.  We know $A$ and $C$ can't share any prime factors, and $B$ can't have any perfect square factors other than 1.  The only way to make this work is if $C$ is a fraction.

"Let's break this down:

* **Let 'f' be the price of one pound of feathers.**
* **Let 'g' be the price of one ounce of gold.**

We can set up two equations based on the given information:

* **Equation 1:** 8f + 2g = 932 
* **Equation 2:** 14f + 3g = 1402

Now we need to solve for 'f' and 'g'.  We can use a few tricks to do this.  

Let's multiply Equation 1 by -7:

* **Equation 1 (modified):** -56f - 14g = -6524

Now let's multiply Equation 2 by 2:

* **Equation 2 (modified):** 28f + 6g = 2804

Add the two modified equations together:

* **Combined:** -28f - 8g = -3720

Divide both sides by -4:

* **Simplified:** 7f + 2g = 930

Now we have a new equation. We can use this along with Equation 1 to solve for 'f' and 'g'.  

But, we don't need to solve for 'f' and 'g' exactly.  We just need to find the cost of 5 pounds of feathers and 5 ounces of gold.

Let's plug in 5 pounds of feathers and 5 ounces of gold into our equations:

"Let the first even number be $x$.  The next even number is $x+2$.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Start with what we know:**

   We know that  *p + q = p*q*  and  *p - q = 7*.

* **Solve for one variable:**

   Let's solve the second equation for *p*:
   *p = q + 7*

* **Substitute:**

   Substitute this value of *p* into the first equation:
   *(q + 7) + q = (q + 7)q*

* **Simplify and solve for q:**

   *2q + 7 = q² + 7q*
   *0 = q² + 5q - 7*

   This is a quadratic equation. We can use the quadratic formula to solve for *q*:

   *q = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a*

   Where a = 1, b = 5, and c = -7.  

   *q = (-5 ± √(5² - 4 * 1 * -7)) / (2 * 1)*
   *q = (-5 ± √(25 + 28)) / 2*
   *q = (-5 ± √53) / 2*

* **Find p:**

   Substitute the values of *q* back into *p = q + 7* to find the corresponding values of *p*.

* **Calculate the expression:**

   Finally, substitute the values of *p* and *q* into the expression  *1 / (1/p² + 1/q²)* and simplify.  You'll get an answer in the form *a + b√c / d*.

* **Step 6:**  To find the average of *a*, *b*, and *c*, we need to find their sum.  We can do this by adding the two equations together:

    * 2a + 2b + 2c = 30

* **Step 7:** Divide both sides by 2 to get the average:

* **Let's use the information given:**

    *  Let the first term of the original series be 'a' and the common ratio be 'r'.
    *  We know the sum of the original series is 2000:  a / (1 - r) = 2000
    *  The new series has each term squared, so its sum is: a² / (1 - r²) = 16 * 2000

"Here's how to solve it:

*  Anything to the power of -1 is the same as 1 over that thing. So,  8⁻¹ is 1/8 and 4⁻¹ is 1/4.

*  Now we have: 1/8 - 1/a = 1

*  To get rid of the 1/a, let's add 1/a to both sides: 1/8 = 1 + 1/a

*  Subtract 1 from both sides: -7/8 = 1/a

*  To isolate 'a', flip both sides: a = -8/7



$\boxed{a = -\dfrac{8}{7}}$
"
"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Step 1:  Find a way to get 'a' by itself in one of the equations.**

   Let's use the second equation:  $a^2b = 135$.  We can divide both sides by $b$ to get  $a^2 = \frac{135}{b}$.

* **Step 2:  Find a way to get 'b' by itself in one of the equations.**

   Let's use the first equation: $ab^2 = \frac{27}{5}$. We can divide both sides by $a$ to get $b^2 = \frac{27}{5a}$.

* **Step 3:  Substitute to solve for 'a' and 'b'.**

   Since we have $a^2 = \frac{135}{b}$ and $b^2 = \frac{27}{5a}$, we can try to make the 'b's match up.  Let's multiply the second equation by 5:

   $5b^2 = \frac{27}{a}$

   Now, we can substitute $\frac{135}{b}$ for $a^2$ in this equation:

   $5b^2 = \frac{27}{\frac{135}{b}}$

   Simplify this:

   $5b^2 = \frac{27b}{135}$

   $5b^2 = \frac{b}{5}$

   Multiply both sides by 5:

   $25b^2 = b$

   Subtract $b$ from both sides:

   $25b^2 - b = 0$

   Factor out a 'b':

   $b(25b - 1) = 0$

   This gives us two possible solutions for $b$:

   * $b = 0$
   * $b = \frac{1}{25}$

* **Step 4:  Solve for 'a' using the values of 'b'.**

   If $b = 0$, then $ab^2 = \frac{27}{5}$ becomes $a(0)^2 = \frac{27}{5}$, which has no solution for 'a'.

   If $b = \frac{1}{25}$, then $a^2b = 135$ becomes $a^2(\frac{1}{25}) = 135$.  Solving for $a^2$ gives us $a^2 = 3375$, and taking the square root of both sides gives us $a = \pm 5\sqrt{135}$.

* **Step 5:  Calculate a + 5b.**

   If $b = \frac{1}{25}$ and $a = 5\sqrt{135}$, then $a + 5b = 5\sqrt{135} + 5(\frac{1}{25}) = 5\sqrt{135} + \frac{1}{5}$.

   If $b = \frac{1}{25}$ and $a = -5\sqrt{135}$, then $a + 5b = -5\sqrt{135} + 5(\frac{1}{25}) = -5\sqrt{135} + \frac{1}{5}$.



$\boxed{a + 5b = 5\sqrt{135} + \frac{1}{5} \text{ or } a + 5b = -5\sqrt{135} + \frac{1}{5}}$

"
"Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Find the roots:**

* We know the quadratic equation is  $2x^2 - 7x + 2 = 0$.
*  We can use the quadratic formula to find the roots:

   $x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$

   Where $a = 2$, $b = -7$, and $c = 2$.

* Plugging in the values:

   $x = \dfrac{7 \pm \sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 2}}{2 \cdot 2}$

   $x = \dfrac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 - 16}}{4}$

   $x = \dfrac{7 \pm \sqrt{33}}{4}$

* So, the roots are $a = \dfrac{7 + \sqrt{33}}{4}$ and $b = \dfrac{7 - \sqrt{33}}{4}$.

**2. Substitute the roots into the expression:**

* We want to find $\dfrac{1}{a-1} + \dfrac{1}{b-1}$

* Substitute the values of $a$ and $b$:

   $\dfrac{1}{\left(\dfrac{7 + \sqrt{33}}{4} - 1\right)} + \dfrac{1}{\left(\dfrac{7 - \sqrt{33}}{4} - 1\right)}$

**3. Simplify:**

*  $\dfrac{1}{\left(\dfrac{7 + \sqrt{33} - 4}{4}\right)} + \dfrac{1}{\left(\dfrac{7 - \sqrt{33} - 4}{4}\right)}$

* $\dfrac{1}{\left(\dfrac{3 + \sqrt{33}}{4}\right)} + \dfrac{1}{\left(\dfrac{3 - \sqrt{33}}{4}\right)}$

* $\dfrac{4}{3 + \sqrt{33}} + \dfrac{4}{3 - \sqrt{33}}$

* To get rid of the radicals in the denominators, we can multiply the numerator and denominator of each fraction by the conjugate of the denominator:

   $\dfrac{4}{3 + \sqrt{33}} \cdot \dfrac{3 - \sqrt{33}}{3 - \sqrt{33}} + \dfrac{4}{3 - \sqrt{33}} \cdot \dfrac{3 + \sqrt{33}}{3 + \sqrt{33}}$

   $\dfrac{12 - 4\sqrt{33}}{(3 + \sqrt{33})(3 - \sqrt{33})} + \dfrac{12 + 4\sqrt{33}}{(3 - \sqrt{33})(3 + \sqrt{33})}$

* Notice that the denominators are the same. We can combine the numerators:

   $\dfrac{12 - 4\sqrt{33} + 12 + 4\sqrt{33}}{(3 + \sqrt{33})(3 - \sqrt{33})}$

* Simplifying:

We are given that $|r_1 - r_2| = |b - 2c|$.  

We can square both sides of this equation to get:

$(r_1 - r_2)^2 = (b - 2c)^2$

Expanding both sides, we get:

$r_1^2 - 2r_1r_2 + r_2^2 = b^2 - 4bc + 4c^2$

We know that $r_1^2 + r_2^2 = (r_1 + r_2)^2 - 2r_1r_2 = (-b)^2 - 2c = b^2 - 2c$.  Substituting this into the equation above, we get:

$b^2 - 2c - 2r_1r_2 = b^2 - 4bc + 4c^2$

Simplifying, we get:

$-2r_1r_2 = -4bc + 6c^2$

Since $r_1r_2 = c$, we have:

$-2c = -4bc + 6c^2$

Rearranging, we get:

$6c^2 - 4bc + 2c = 0$

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

$3c^2 - 2bc + c = 0$

This is a quadratic equation in $c$.  We can solve for $c$ using the quadratic formula:

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use some fancy words:**  We know the patio is a rectangle, so it has two long sides (length) and two short sides (width).

* **Think about the area:**  Area is like how much space is inside the rectangle. We know it's 180 square feet. That means length times width equals 180.

* **Think about the perimeter:** Perimeter is like the fence around the rectangle. We know it's 54 feet. That means two lengths plus two widths equals 54.

* **Now we have two equations:**
    *  length * width = 180
    *  2 * length + 2 * width = 54

* **Solve for length and width:** This might take a little bit of math, but you can use these equations to figure out how long and wide the patio is.

* **Diagonal is the shortcut:** Once you know the length and width, you can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the diagonal.  The Pythagorean theorem says:  length squared plus width squared equals diagonal squared.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Picture it:** Imagine a triangle. One side is along a slanted line, one side is along the bottom (x-axis), and the third side goes straight up.

* **Base and Height:** The base of the triangle is along the x-axis.  The height is how far up the slanted line goes.

* **Finding the Height:**  The slanted line is  $y = \frac{2}{3}x + 5$.  When the line hits the x-axis, $y=0$.  So, we can find where it crosses the x-axis by solving:

   $0 = \frac{2}{3}x + 5$
   $-5 = \frac{2}{3}x$
   $x = -\frac{15}{2}$

* **The Height:** The height of the triangle is the y-value of the point where the line $x=k$ intersects the slanted line.  Substitute $x=k$ into the equation of the slanted line:

   $y = \frac{2}{3}k + 5$

* **Area:** The area of a triangle is  $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \text{base} \cdot \text{height}$.  The base is  $k - (-\frac{15}{2}) = k + \frac{15}{2}$.  So the area is:

   $\frac{1}{2} \cdot (k + \frac{15}{2}) \cdot (\frac{2}{3}k + 5) < 20$

* **Using the Given Information:** We know $g(x) = 3x + 2$ and $g(x) = 2f^{-1}(x)$. This means:
   
   $3x + 2 = 2f^{-1}(x)$

* **Solving for  f⁻¹(x):**  Let's isolate $f^{-1}(x)$:

   $f^{-1}(x) = \dfrac{3x + 2}{2}$

* **Finding f(x):**  Since $f^{-1}(x)$ is the inverse of $f(x)$, we can find $f(x)$ by swapping $x$ and $y$ and solving for $y$:

   Let $y = f(x)$
   Then $x = f^{-1}(y)$

* If A weighs 40% more than B, that means A weighs 140% of B's weight.
* A also weighs 30% less than C, so A weighs 70% of C's weight.

Now we can set up a little equation:

140% of B = 70% of C

Let's say C weighs 100.  That means A weighs 70.  And since A is 140% of B, B must weigh 50.

So the ratio of B to C is 50 to 100, which can be simplified to 1/2.

2. **Distance is key:**  The radius of the circle is the distance from the center to any point on the circle. We know two points on the circle, so we can use that to find the radius.

3. **Use the distance formula:**  The distance formula helps us find the distance between two points. It looks like this:

4. **Plug in the numbers:** Let's use the points (-3, 2) and (-2, 3).

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let 'g' be the weight of one green ball.**
* **Let 'r' be the weight of one red ball.**

We can set up two equations based on the given information:

*  5g + 2r = 10  
*  1g + 4r = 7

Now we need to solve for 'g' and 'r'.  One way to do this is using substitution:

1. **Solve the second equation for 'g':**
   g = 7 - 4r

2. **Substitute this value of 'g' into the first equation:**
   5(7 - 4r) + 2r = 10

3. **Simplify and solve for 'r':**
   35 - 20r + 2r = 10
   -18r = -25
   r = 25/18

4. **Substitute the value of 'r' back into either equation to solve for 'g':**
   g = 7 - 4(25/18)
   g = 7 - 50/9
   g = 13/9

Now we know:

* One green ball weighs 13/9 pounds
* One red ball weighs 25/18 pounds

Finally, we can find the weight of 8 red and 8 green balls:

* 8 green balls: 8 * (13/9) = 104/9 pounds
* 8 red balls: 8 * (25/18) = 100/9 pounds

* **Total weight:** (104/9) + (100/9) = 204/9 = **22.67 pounds**

   * (A + B + C) / 3 = 6  (The average of their ages is 6)
   * C - 4 = A (Four years ago, Chris was Amy's current age)
   * B + 4 = (3/5)(A + 4) (In four years, Ben's age will be 3/5 of Amy's age)

* **Now we can use these equations to solve for C (Chris's current age):**

   1.  From the first equation, we get: A + B + C = 18
   2.  Substitute C - 4 for A in the second equation: C - 4 + B + C = 18
   3.  Simplify: 2C + B = 22
   4.  Substitute B + 4 = (3/5)(A + 4) into the equation above: 2C + (3/5)(A + 4) - 4 = 22
   5.  Since A = C - 4, substitute that in: 2C + (3/5)(C - 4 + 4) - 4 = 22
   6.  Simplify: 2C + (3/5)C - 4 = 22

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Find the sums:**
    * The sum of the first 5 even numbers is 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30
    * The sum of the first 8 odd numbers is 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 = 64

* **Set up the equation:**  The problem says the sum of the even numbers is 4 *less* than the sum of the odd numbers. So: 
   30 = 64 - 4

* **Solve for the missing even number:**  This equation doesn't help us find the smallest even number directly.  We need to think about how the problem is set up.  

Let's say the smallest even number is 'x'. The next four even numbers would be x+2, x+4, x+6, and x+8.  Their sum is x + (x+2) + (x+4) + (x+6) + (x+8) = 5x + 20

We know this sum is 4 less than the sum of the first 8 odd numbers, which is 64. So:

5x + 20 = 64 - 4

5x + 20 = 60

5x = 40

  $\dfrac{10^{1/2}}{10^{1/4}}$

  $10^{1/2 - 1/4} = 10^{1/4}$



$\boxed{10^{1/4}}$
"
"Here's how I'd solve this problem:

First, let's deal with the radicals.  

*  $\sqrt[5]{16}$ is the same as $16^{1/5}$.  
*  $\sqrt{3}$ is the same as $3^{1/2}$.

Now, to get rid of the radicals in the denominators, we need to multiply both the numerator and denominator by something that will make the denominator a whole number.

For the first term, $\frac{3}{\sqrt[5]{16}}$, we can multiply by $16^{4/5}$:

$$\frac{3}{\sqrt[5]{16}} \cdot \frac{16^{4/5}}{16^{4/5}} = \frac{3 \cdot 16^{4/5}}{16}$$

For the second term, $\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$, we can multiply by $\sqrt{3}$:

$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$$

Now we have:

$$\frac{3 \cdot 16^{4/5}}{16} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$$

To combine these, we need a common denominator.  The least common denominator is $16 \cdot 3 = 48$.  So we get:

$$\frac{3 \cdot 16^{4/5} \cdot 3}{48} + \frac{\sqrt{3} \cdot 16}{48}$$

Which simplifies to:

$$\frac{9 \cdot 16^{4/5} + 16\sqrt{3}}{48}$$

Now we have the form $\frac{a^2\sqrt[5]{b}+b\sqrt{a}}{ab}$ where:

* $a = 48$
* $b = 16$

Finally, $a + b = 48 + 16 = \boxed{64}$.

*  Josh rides slower than Mike, at four-fifths of Mike's speed.

That means Josh covers less distance than Mike in the same amount of time.

Since they meet in the middle, they must have ridden the same distance.  

Let's say Mike rode *x* miles.  Josh rode *2x* times as long, but at four-fifths the speed, so he rode (4/5)*x* miles.

They both rode the same distance, so:

*x* = (4/5)*x*

To solve for *x*, we can subtract (4/5)*x* from both sides:

(1/5)*x* = 0

"Here's how to figure this out:

**Simple Interest**

*  Simple interest is just a flat fee.
*  7% of $10,000 is $700 per year.
*  Over 5 years, that's $700 * 5 = $3,500 in interest.

**Compound Interest**

*  Compound interest means the interest grows each year.
*  It's a little trickier to calculate, but here's the idea:
    * Year 1: 6% of $10,000 is $600 interest.
    * Year 2: 6% of $10,600 (original + year 1 interest) is a bit more.
    * And so on...

**The Answer**

Since compound interest is always a bit more, Sue would pay back more with the 6% compound interest.  To be exact, we'd need to calculate all those years of compound interest. But the question just wants us to round to the nearest dollar. 

Since simple interest is $3,500, the compound interest will be a bit more than that.

If we let  $x$ equal that whole thing, we get:

See?  It's the same thing over and over.  Now, if we square both sides, we get:

Wait a minute! That's just like our original problem, but without the square root on the outside!  So, we can say:

$x^2 = 12 - x$

Now we have a regular equation we can solve. Let's move everything to one side:

This factors nicely:

$(x + 4)(x - 3) = 0$

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Find the slope of line c:**

The equation of line $c$ is in slope-intercept form ($y = mx + b$), where $m$ is the slope.  So, the slope of line $c$ is $-2$.

**2. Find the slope of line b:**

Line $b$ is perpendicular to line $c$.  Perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals of each other. The negative reciprocal of $-2$ is $\frac{1}{2}$.

**3. Find the equation of line b:**

We know line $b$ has a slope of $\frac{1}{2}$ and passes through the point $(3,1)$. We can use the point-slope form of a linear equation:

$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$

Plugging in our values:

$y - 1 = \frac{1}{2}(x - 3)$

**4. Find the equation of line a:**

Line $a$ is parallel to line $b$, so it has the same slope, which is $\frac{1}{2}$.  We also know line $a$ passes through the point $(1,2)$.  Using the point-slope form again:

$y - 2 = \frac{1}{2}(x - 1)$

**5. Find the y-intercept of line a:**

To find the y-intercept, we need to rewrite the equation in slope-intercept form ($y = mx + b$).

$y - 2 = \frac{1}{2}x - \frac{1}{2}$

$y = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{3}{2}$

The y-intercept is $\boxed{\frac{3}{2}}$.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Find the x-intercept (a):**

*  The x-intercept is the point where the line crosses the x-axis. This happens when y = 0.
*  Plug in y = 0 into the equation:  x/4 + 0/12 = 1
*  Simplify: x/4 = 1
*  Multiply both sides by 4: x = 4. So, a = 4

**2. Find the y-intercept (b):**

* The y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis. This happens when x = 0.
* Plug in x = 0 into the equation: 0/4 + y/12 = 1
* Simplify: y/12 = 1

   $ab + b = a$
   $b(a + 1) = a$
   $a = \frac{b(a + 1)}{b}$

3. **Substitute:**
   Now we can substitute this value of *a* into the expression we want to minimize:
   $\frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{a} - ab$ 
   becomes:
   $\frac{b(a + 1)}{b^2} + \frac{b}{ \frac{b(a + 1)}{b}} - \frac{b(a + 1)}{b}$

4. **Simplify:**
   This simplifies to:
   $\frac{a + 1}{b} + \frac{1}{a + 1} - (a + 1)$

5. **Find the minimum:**
   To find the smallest value, we can use calculus (taking the derivative and setting it to zero) or try to manipulate the expression to see if we can find a pattern.  

   Since this problem doesn't seem to have an obvious pattern, let's try to use the AM-GM inequality:

   * **AM-GM Inequality:** For non-negative numbers *x* and *y*,  
     $\frac{x + y}{2} \ge \sqrt{xy}$

   Applying this to our expression:
   $\frac{ \frac{a + 1}{b} + \frac{1}{a + 1}}{2} \ge \sqrt{\frac{a + 1}{b} \cdot \frac{1}{a + 1}}$

   This simplifies to:
   $\frac{a + 1}{2b} + \frac{1}{2(a + 1)} \ge \frac{1}{\sqrt{b}}$

   Now, we can rewrite our original expression:
   $\frac{a + 1}{b} + \frac{1}{a + 1} - (a + 1) = 2 \left( \frac{a + 1}{2b} + \frac{1}{2(a + 1)} \right) - (a + 1)$

   Using the AM-GM inequality, we know the left side of the equation is greater than or equal to:
   $2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{b}} - (a + 1)$

   To minimize this expression, we need to minimize $(a + 1)$.  Since *a* is non-zero, the smallest possible value for $(a + 1)$ is 2.

6. **Final Calculation:**
   Substituting $(a + 1) = 2$ into our expression:
   $2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{b}} - 2$



   Since we don't have more information about *b*, we can't find a specific numerical answer.  However, we know the smallest possible value of the expression is  $\boxed{2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{b}} - 2}$.

"Here's how to solve this:

* The second term is 'a + d' (since it's one step up in the sequence).
* The third term is 'a + 2d'.
* The fourth term is 'a + 3d'.

We know the fourth term is 8, so:

a + 3d = 8

We also know the first term equals the third minus the second:

a = (a + 2d) - (a + d)

Simplifying that:

a = a + 2d - a - d
a = d

Now we can substitute 'd' for 'a' in our first equation:

d + 3d = 8

4d = 8

d = 2

Since a = d, then a = 2.

Notice that  $x^3 - y^3$ looks like it could be the result of a difference of cubes pattern:  $a^3 - b^3 = (a-b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)$.

Let's try to use our known equations to make this work:

1. **Solve for one variable:**  From the first equation, we can say  $x = y + 6$.

2. **Substitute:**  Let's substitute $(y + 6)$ for $x$ in the second equation:
   $(y + 6)^2 + y^2 = 24$

3. **Expand and simplify:**
   $y^2 + 12y + 36 + y^2 = 24$

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Understand the Problem**

We're given a quadratic equation and told its roots. We need to figure out the value of 'b' in a specific form and then find the sum of two numbers.

**2. Use the Quadratic Formula**

The quadratic formula helps us find the roots of an equation in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$:

  *  $x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$

**3. Match the Roots**

We know the roots are $\dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}$.  Let's match this to the quadratic formula:

  *  $\dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{5}}{2} = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$

**4. Solve for 'a', 'b', and 'c'**

*  In our equation, $a = 1$, $c = b + 3$. 
*  Since the roots are the same, we can equate the numerators: $-b \pm \sqrt{5} = -b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4(1)(b+3)}$

**5. Simplify and Solve for 'b'**

*  This simplifies to $\sqrt{5} = \sqrt{b^2 - 4b - 12}$
*  Squaring both sides: $5 = b^2 - 4b - 12$
*  Rearranging: $b^2 - 4b - 17 = 0$

Now we have a quadratic equation to solve for 'b'.  We can use the quadratic formula again, or we can try to factor it.  

**6.  Find 'm' and 'n'**

*  Once you find the value of 'b', express it in the form $m + \sqrt{n}$ and find the sum $m + n$.

   10(R - r) ≤ 5

"Let's break this down:

* **Find the inverse:**  To find the inverse, we swap $a$ and $f(a)$ and solve for $f(a)$.

   So, if $f(a) = \frac{1}{1-a}$, then we have:
   
   $a = \frac{1}{1-f(a)}$

   Now, solve for $f(a)$:
   
   $a(1-f(a)) = 1$
   $a - af(a) = 1$
   $-af(a) = 1-a$
   $f(a) = \frac{a-1}{a}$

   So, $f^{-1}(a) = \frac{a-1}{a}$

* **Multiply it all together:**

   Now we have:
   
   $f^{-1}(a) \times a \times f(a) = \frac{a-1}{a} \times a \times \frac{1}{1-a}$

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We know the roots of a quadratic equation are the values of *x* that make the equation true.  We're given the roots, and we need to find the value of *k*.

**Using the Relationship Between Roots and Coefficients**

There's a handy rule that connects the roots of a quadratic equation to its coefficients:

* **For a quadratic equation of the form  *ax² + bx + c = 0*, the sum of the roots is -b/a, and the product of the roots is c/a.**

**Applying the Rule**

1. **Sum of roots:**
   The sum of our roots is: 
   (-7 + i√15)/8 + (-7 - i√15)/8 = -14/8 = -7/4

2. **Product of roots:**
   The product of our roots is:
   [(-7 + i√15)/8] * [(-7 - i√15)/8] = (49 + 15)/64 = 64/64 = 1

3. **Finding k:**
   In our equation, *a = 4*, *b = 7*, and *c = k*.  We know:
   * -b/a = -7/4 (from the sum of roots)
   * c/a = 1 (from the product of roots)

   Since *a = 4*, we can solve for *k*:
   *k = c = a * 1 = 4*

We want to find $x^3 - y^3$.  

Notice that we can use the following pattern:

* $x^3 - y^3 = (x-y)(x^2 + xy + y^2)$

Let's break it down:

1. **We know (x - y) = 1**

2. **We need to find  (x² + xy + y²)**

   *  We can rearrange the second equation: $x^2 + y^2 = 7$
   *  We don't know 'xy' directly, but we can try to find it.

3. **Let's try to express 'xy' in terms of (x - y) and (x² + y²)**

   *  Square the equation (x - y) = 1:  
      (x - y)² = 1²
      x² - 2xy + y² = 1
   *  Now, rearrange to solve for xy:
      2xy = x² + y² - 1
      xy = (x² + y² - 1) / 2

4. **Substitute the values we know:**

   *  xy = (7 - 1) / 2 = 3

5. **Now we have everything to plug into the pattern:**

   *  x³ - y³ = (x - y)(x² + xy + y²)

*  Since the whole thing is a degree 36 polynomial, the $h(g(x))$ part must balance things out.  

*  To get a degree 36 polynomial, the highest power of $x$ in $h(g(x))$ must be $36 - 18 = 18$.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

1. **Get everything on one side:** 
   Subtract 7x from both sides of the equation:
   $$x^2 - 7x + 1 = 0$$

2. **Solve for x:** This equation doesn't factor easily, so we'll use the quadratic formula:
   $$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
   Where $a = 1$, $b = -7$, and $c = 1$.

   Plugging in:
   $$x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 1}$$

   Simplifying:
   $$x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 - 4}}{2}$$
   $$x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{45}}{2}$$
   $$x = \frac{7 \pm 3\sqrt{5}}{2}$$

3. **Find the reciprocal:** The reciprocal of a number is 1 divided by that number. So, the reciprocal of  $x = \frac{7 + 3\sqrt{5}}{2}$ is $\frac{2}{7 + 3\sqrt{5}}$.

4. **Add x and its reciprocal:**
   $$\frac{7 + 3\sqrt{5}}{2} + \frac{2}{7 + 3\sqrt{5}}$$

   To add these fractions, we need a common denominator:
   $$\frac{(7 + 3\sqrt{5})(7 + 3\sqrt{5})}{2(7 + 3\sqrt{5})} + \frac{2 \cdot 2}{2(7 + 3\sqrt{5})}$$

2. **Move everything to one side:**  Let's get all the terms on one side to make it a quadratic equation:

   2*x*² + (*k* + 1)*x* + 2 = 0

3. **Think about the solutions:**  We want there to be *exactly one* solution. This means the quadratic equation has a double root (the solutions are the same).

4. **Use the discriminant:** The discriminant of a quadratic equation (a*x*² + b*x* + c = 0) is *b*² - 4*a*c.  If the discriminant is zero, the quadratic has a double root.

   In our equation, *a* = 2, *b* = *k* + 1, and *c* = 2.  So, the discriminant is:

   (*k* + 1)² - 4 * 2 * 2 = *k*² + 2*k* + 1 - 16 = *k*² + 2*k* - 15

We can write:

$$\dfrac{1}{a} + \dfrac{1}{b} = \dfrac{b}{ab} + \dfrac{a}{ab} = \dfrac{a+b}{ab}$$

Since we know $a+b=7$, we can substitute that in:

$$\dfrac{a+b}{ab} = \dfrac{7}{ab}$$

Now we need to figure out what $ab$ is.  We can use the fact that $a^3 + b^3 = 42$.  There's a trick for this!  Remember that:

$$a^3 + b^3 = (a+b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)$$

We know $a+b=7$, so:

Dividing both sides by 7:

$$6 = a^2 - ab + b^2$$

We can rearrange this to solve for $ab$:

$$ab = a^2 + b^2 - 6$$

Unfortunately, we can't find the exact values of $a$ and $b$ from this.  But, we can substitute this expression for $ab$ back into our earlier equation:

$$\dfrac{7}{ab} = \dfrac{7}{a^2 + b^2 - 6}$$

We know the roots of a quadratic equation are the values of *x* that make the equation true.  We're given the roots, and we need to find the value of *k*.

**Using the Relationship Between Roots and Coefficients**

There's a special relationship between the roots of a quadratic equation and its coefficients. For a quadratic equation in the form  $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the sum of the roots is $-b/a$ and the product of the roots is $c/a$.

**Applying the Relationship**

1. **Sum of roots:**
   The sum of the roots is:  
   (-5 + i√11)/6 + (-5 - i√11)/6 = -10/6 = -5/3

2. **Product of roots:**

   [(-5 + i√11)/6] * [(-5 - i√11)/6] = (25 + 11)/36 = 36/36 = 1

3. **Finding k:**
   In our equation, $3x^2 + 5x + k = 0$, we have  *a* = 3, *b* = 5.  We know the sum of the roots is -5/3, so:

"Here's how I'd solve this problem:

First, I gotta simplify those square roots:

* $\sqrt{245} = \sqrt{49 \cdot 5} = 7\sqrt{5}$
* $\sqrt{125} = \sqrt{25 \cdot 5} = 5\sqrt{5}$
* $\sqrt{45} = \sqrt{9 \cdot 5} = 3\sqrt{5}$

Now, let's plug those back into the original expression:

$\dfrac{6}{7\sqrt{5} + 3 \cdot 5\sqrt{5} + 4 \cdot 3\sqrt{5}}$

That simplifies to:

$\dfrac{6}{7\sqrt{5} + 15\sqrt{5} + 12\sqrt{5}}$

Which is:

$\dfrac{6}{34\sqrt{5}}$

To get rid of the square root in the denominator, I'll multiply both the top and bottom by $\sqrt{5}$:

$\dfrac{6 \cdot \sqrt{5}}{34\sqrt{5} \cdot \sqrt{5}}$

This gives us:

$\dfrac{6\sqrt{5}}{170}$

We can simplify this a bit more by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2:

$\dfrac{3\sqrt{5}}{85}$

So, $A = 3$, $B = 5$, and $C = 85$.

Finally,  $A + B + C = 3 + 5 + 85 = \boxed{93}$.

"Let's break this down.

We got a big ol' square root here, with another square root inside, and another one inside that!  It looks like it goes on forever.  

But here's the thing: if we let  the whole thing equal 5, we can start to solve for *x*.

So, we got:

$$\sqrt{x + \sqrt{x + \sqrt{x + \ldots}}} = 5$$

Let's just call the whole square root thing ""y"" for now, so it's easier to read:

$$y = 5$$

Now, we know that *y* is equal to the big square root.  Let's write that out:

$$y = \sqrt{x + \sqrt{x + \sqrt{x + \ldots}}}$$

Since we know *y* is 5, we can plug that in:

$$5 = \sqrt{x + \sqrt{x + \sqrt{x + \ldots}}}$$

But wait!  Look at the stuff under the square root. It's the same as *y*!  So we can write:

$$5 = \sqrt{x + y}$$

Now we can solve for *x*:

1. Square both sides:  $$25 = x + y$$
2. Since we know *y* is 5, plug it in: $$25 = x + 5$$
3. Subtract 5 from both sides: $$20 = x$$

* **Step 4:** Now we want to find (x + y + w)/z. Let's substitute the values we found:

We need to find two numbers that are both prime (like 2, 3, 5, 7, and so on) and that are less than 50.  

If we square a small prime number, it gets pretty big fast.  Let's try squaring some numbers and see if we get close to 1488.

* 7 squared is 49
* 11 squared is 121
* 13 squared is 169
* 17 squared is 289

Hmm, those are getting too big.  Let's go back a bit.

* 23 squared is 529

That's way too big!

**1. Find the midpoint of each segment:**

* **Segment 1:**  
   The midpoint formula is  ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2)
   *  ((2 + 0)/2, (4 + (-2))/2) = (1, 1)

* **Segment 2:**
   * ((5 + 1)/2, (1 + 5)/2) = (3, 3)

**2. Find the slope between the two midpoints:**

*  The slope formula is (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
*  (3 - 1) / (3 - 1) = 2 / 2 = 1

"Here's how to solve it:

* **Case 1:**  x + 3 = 6
   * x = 6 - 3
   * x = 3

* **Case 2:** x + 3 = -6
   * x = -6 - 3
   * x = -9

The two solutions are 3 and -9.  To find the positive difference, we take the bigger number and subtract the smaller number:

3 - (-9) = 3 + 9 = 12

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use letters:**

    *  Let 's' be the price of the sombrero.
    *  Let 'f' be the price of the flip-flops.
    *  Let 'g' be the price of the sunglasses.

* **Write down the information as equations:**

    *  s + f = 32 
    *  f + g = 42
    *  s + g = 30

* **Solve for 's' (the price of the sombrero):**

    One way to do this is to use the first and third equations:

    *  s + f = 32
    *  s + g = 30

    Subtract the second equation from the first:

    *  f - g = 2

    Now we know that the flip-flops cost $2 more than the sunglasses.  We can use this to find 's'.  

    Since we don't have another equation with just 's' and 'f', we can't solve for 's' directly.

"Here's how to fix that messy denominator:

We can use something called a ""conjugate"" to get rid of the cube roots in the bottom.  Think of it like this:

*  We want to make the bottom look like a regular number, not a bunch of roots.
*  The conjugate of $\sqrt[3]{4} + \sqrt[3]{32}$ is $\sqrt[3]{4^2} - \sqrt[3]{4} \sqrt[3]{32} + \sqrt[3]{32^2}$.

Let's multiply the top and bottom by this conjugate:

$$\frac{2}{\sqrt[3]{4}+\sqrt[3]{32}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt[3]{4^2} - \sqrt[3]{4} \sqrt[3]{32} + \sqrt[3]{32^2}}{\sqrt[3]{4^2} - \sqrt[3]{4} \sqrt[3]{32} + \sqrt[3]{32^2}}$$

Now, the bottom will simplify nicely:

$$\frac{2(\sqrt[3]{4^2} - \sqrt[3]{4} \sqrt[3]{32} + \sqrt[3]{32^2})}{(\sqrt[3]{4})^3 + (\sqrt[3]{32})^3}$$

That's just:

$$\frac{2(\sqrt[3]{16} - \sqrt[3]{128} + \sqrt[3]{1024})}{4 + 32}$$

$$\frac{2(\sqrt[3]{16} - \sqrt[3]{128} + \sqrt[3]{1024})}{36}$$

If $x$ is positive, then $|x|$ is just $x$. So the equation becomes $x^2 = -x$.  That means $x^2 + x = 0$, and we can factor that as $x(x+1) = 0$. That gives us two solutions: $x=0$ and $x=-1$. But $x$ can't be negative if it's positive, so only $x=0$ works.

If $x$ is negative, then $|x|$ is $-x$. So the equation becomes $x^2 = x$. That means $x^2 - x = 0$, and we can factor that as $x(x-1) = 0$. That gives us two solutions: $x=0$ and $x=1$. But $x$ can't be positive if it's negative, so only $x=0$ works.

"Well, to find what numbers we can put into this thingy, we gotta make sure we don't get any funny business like square roots of negative numbers.

First, the inside part,  $x^2 - 16$, has to be bigger than or equal to zero. That's 'cause we can't take the square root of a negative number.

So, $x^2 - 16 \ge 0$.  Adding 16 to both sides, we get $x^2 \ge 16$.  This means $x$ has to be bigger than 4 or smaller than -4.

Now, the next part is $\sqrt{x^2 - 16} - 3$.  We need that to be bigger than or equal to zero too, so we can take its square root.

So, $\sqrt{x^2 - 16} - 3 \ge 0$.  Adding 3 to both sides, we get $\sqrt{x^2 - 16} \ge 3$.  Squaring both sides, we get $x^2 - 16 \ge 9$.  Adding 16 to both sides, we get $x^2 \ge 25$.  This means $x$ has to be bigger than 5 or smaller than -5.

* **Matching coefficients:**  For this to be equal to our original quadratic (x² + kx + 15), the coefficients must match:

* **Finding the factors of 15:**  The factors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, and 15.  We need to find pairs of these factors that add up to 'k'.

* **Revenue** is how much money the store makes. It's found by multiplying the price of each book by how many books they sell.

* So, the store's revenue (R) is:  R = $p * (120 - 3p)$

* To find the best price, we need to find the price that makes R the biggest.  That's like finding the highest point on a hill.

*  We can use a trick to find that highest point without drawing a graph.  We take the formula for R and try to make it look like a nice, easy equation.

* Let's spread it out: R = $120p - 3p^2$

*  The highest point of this hill is in the middle.  To find the middle, we can take half of the number in front of the 'p' and plug it in. Half of 120 is 60.

*  So, the price that might make the most money is $60. But wait! The problem said the price can't be more than $40.

*  That means the highest price we can try is $40. Let's plug that in to see how much money we make: R = $40 * (120 - 3 * $40) = $40 * (120 - $120) = $40 * $0 = $0

**Understanding the Problem**

We know the roots of a quadratic equation are the values of *x* that make the equation true.  We're given two roots, and we need to find the value of *c*.

**Using the Roots**

There's a handy formula that connects the roots of a quadratic equation to its coefficients:

*  If the roots of the equation  *ax² + bx + c = 0* are *r₁* and *r₂*, then:
    *  *r₁ + r₂ = -b/a*
    *  *r₁ * r₂ = c/a*

**Applying the Formula**

1. **Find the sum of the roots:**
   *  (-99 + √8001) + (-99 - √8001) = -198

2. **Find the product of the roots:**
   *  (-99 + √8001) * (-99 - √8001) = (-99)² - (√8001)² = 9801 - 8001 = 1800

*  So, to figure out a big power of $i$, you just gotta see where it falls in that circle.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Understanding the Problem:**

We have an equation with a special kind of number called a root (the fourth root).  We need to figure out what happens to the same number when the power changes.

* **Using the Rules:**

When you have the same number raised to different powers, you can use the rules of exponents.  

* **Solving:**

1. **Simplify the first equation:**  
   We know  $(\sqrt[4]{11})^{3x-3} = \frac{1}{5}$.  This means  $(\sqrt[4]{11})^{3x-3} = (\sqrt[4]{11})^{-1}$.

2. **Match the powers:**
   Since the bases are the same, the powers must be equal: 
   $3x - 3 = -1$

3. **Solve for x:**
   Add 3 to both sides: $3x = 2$
   Divide both sides by 3: $x = \frac{2}{3}$

4. **Substitute x back into the second expression:**
   We want to find $(\sqrt[4]{11})^{6x+2}$. Substitute $x = \frac{2}{3}$:
   $(\sqrt[4]{11})^{6(\frac{2}{3})+2}$

5. **Simplify:**
   $(\sqrt[4]{11})^{4 + 2} = (\sqrt[4]{11})^6$

6. **Express as a fraction:**

* **Midpoint Formula:** The midpoint of a line segment is found by averaging the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of the endpoints.

   Since Q is the midpoint of PT, we have:

* **Solving for x and y:**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

First, we expand the cube:

$(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3})^3 = (\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3})(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3})(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3})$

When we multiply this out, we get a bunch of terms with different combinations of $\sqrt{2}$ and $\sqrt{3}$.  We need to group the terms that have $\sqrt{6}$ in them.

After doing the multiplication, we'll have a bunch of numbers and terms with $\sqrt{2}$, $\sqrt{3}$, and $\sqrt{6}$.  We'll add up all the $\sqrt{2}$ terms, all the $\sqrt{3}$ terms, and all the $\sqrt{6}$ terms.

That will give us the answer in the form $a\sqrt{2} + b\sqrt{3} + c\sqrt{6}$.  Then we just add $a$, $b$, and $c$ to find the final answer.

2. **Factor the numerator:** The top part, $c^2 + 6c - 27$, looks like it might factor.  Hmm, what numbers multiply to -27 and add up to 6?  That's 9 and -3! So, the numerator factors to $(c+9)(c-3)$.

* We also know $h(-1) = 1$, which means:

* **Understanding the Problem:**

We have a point in the bottom left part of the coordinate plane (both x and y are negative).  We know how far it is from the bottom (x-axis) and from a specific point. We also know the distance to the center (origin). We need to find a number that, when we take its square root, gives us that distance.

* **Using the Information:**

* **Distance from x-axis:** Since the point is 6 units from the x-axis, its y-coordinate must be -6.

* **Distance from (8,3):** We can use the distance formula to find the possible x-coordinates. The distance formula is:

√[(x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²]

Let (x, -6) be our point and (8, 3) be the other point.  We know the distance is 15:

15 = √[(x - 8)² + (-6 - 3)²]

* **Distance from the origin:**  The distance from the origin (0,0) to (x, -6) is:

√(x² + (-6)²) = √(x² + 36)

We know this distance is √n.

* **Solving for x:**

We have two equations with two unknowns (x and n). We can solve for x in the distance equation from (8,3) and then substitute it into the distance equation from the origin to find n.

* **Finding n:**

Once we have x, we can plug it into the distance equation from the origin and square both sides to find n.

"Let's think about this.  

If 144 divided by some number equals a number that starts with 1, that means the number we're dividing by has to be pretty big.  

We know the answer is a whole number, so let's try some numbers.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Start with the original parabola:** The equation  $y = -(x + 1)^2 + 1$  tells us the parabola opens downwards and its vertex is at (-1, 1).

2. **Shift right:** Moving the parabola 1 unit to the right means we replace  'x' with 'x - 1' in the equation. This gives us:
   $y = -(x - 1 + 1)^2 + 1$  which simplifies to  $y = -(x)^2 + 1$

3. **Shift down:** Shifting 5 units down means we subtract 5 from the entire equation:
   $y = -(x)^2 + 1 - 5$ which simplifies to $y = -x^2 - 4$

4. **Rotate 180 degrees:** Rotating the parabola 180 degrees about its vertex doesn't change the equation. The vertex is still at (0, -4).

5. **Find the zeros:**  To find the zeros, we set y = 0 and solve for x:
   $0 = -x^2 - 4$
   $x^2 = -4$
   This equation has no real solutions because you can't have a negative number under a square root.

6. **Conclusion:** Since the parabola doesn't have any real zeros, we can't find values for 'a' and 'b'.

   $3x + (7 - x) = 45$

* **Step 3:** Simplify and solve for $x$:

   $2x + 7 = 45$
   $2x = 38$
   $x = 19$

* **Step 4:** Now that we know $x = 19$, we can find $y$:

   $y = 7 - x$
   $y = 7 - 19$
   $y = -12$

* **Step 5:**  Finally, let's calculate $x^2 - y^2$:

   $x^2 - y^2 = 19^2 - (-12)^2$

2. **Solve for x:**

   * Subtract $\frac{1}{2}x^2$ and $x$ from both sides: 
     $$\frac{1}{2}x^2 + 3x = 0$$
   * Factor out an $x$:

     * $\frac{1}{2}x + 3 = 0  \Rightarrow x = -6$

3. **Find the corresponding y-values:**  Plug each x-value back into either of the original equations to find the y-values. Let's use $y = x^2 + 4x + 6$:

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Set the equations equal to each other:**  Since the graphs intersect, the y-values are the same. So we have:
   
   $x^4 = 7x^2 - 10$

* **Rearrange into a quadratic:**  Let's make this look like a simpler equation. Move all the terms to one side:

   $x^4 - 7x^2 + 10 = 0$

* **Substitute:**  Let's use a little trick.  Let $y = x^2$. Now our equation becomes:

   $y^2 - 7y + 10 = 0$

* **Solve for y:** This is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it:

   $(y-5)(y-2) = 0$

   This gives us two solutions: $y = 5$ and $y = 2$.

* **Substitute back:** Remember that $y = x^2$. So:

   *  $x^2 = 5$  means  $x = \pm \sqrt{5}$
   *  $x^2 = 2$  means  $x = \pm \sqrt{2}$

* **Find m and n:** We're told the x-coordinates are $\pm \sqrt{m}$ and $\pm \sqrt{n}$, where $m > n$.  So:

   * $m = 5$
   * $n = 2$

* **Calculate m - n:**

   This simplifies to:

   $$6r^2 - 19r - 7 = (4r-3)(2r-7)$$

2. **Expand the right side:**

   We use the FOIL method to multiply out the right side:

   $$6r^2 - 19r - 7 = 8r^2 - 31r + 21$$

3. **Move everything to one side:**

   Subtract $8r^2 - 31r + 21$ from both sides to get a quadratic equation:

4. **Simplify:**

   Divide both sides by 2:

   $$0 = r^2 - 6r + 14$$

"Let's think about this:

* We know all the triangles are the same value.
* We know all the circles are the same value.

If we add up all the shapes in the first equation, we get:

3 triangles + 3 circles = 21

If we add up all the shapes in the second equation, we get:

3 circles + 3 triangles = 16

Notice that both equations have the same shapes just in a different order. This means the triangles and circles must have the same value!

Let's say a triangle is worth 'T' and a circle is worth 'C'.  We can write the equations like this:

3T + 3C = 21
3C + 3T = 16

Since both equations are the same, we can solve for T or C.  Let's solve for T:

3T = 21 - 3C
T = 7 - C

Now we know that a triangle is worth 7 minus the value of a circle.  

We want to find the sum of two circles, which is 2C.  

Let's plug in our value for T into either of the original equations.  Let's use the first one:

3(7 - C) + 3C = 21
21 - 3C + 3C = 21
21 = 21

This means our equations work!  

So, the sum of two circles is:

\begin{equation*}
\bigcirc + \bigcirc = 2C
\end{equation*}

We don't know the exact value of C, but we know it's the same for all circles.

**1. Figure out the original numbers:**

* Let the first number be  'x'
* The next three numbers are 'x+1', 'x+2', and 'x+3'
* Their sum is x + (x+1) + (x+2) + (x+3) = 22

   * Take the square root of both sides: $x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{12}} = \pm \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}$

2. **Find 1/x⁴:**

   *  Since $x = \pm \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}$, we have two possibilities:
      *  If $x = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}$, then $\frac{1}{x^4} = \left(2\sqrt{3}\right)^4 = 16 \cdot 3^2 = 144$
      * If $x = -\frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}$, then $\frac{1}{x^4} = \left(2\sqrt{3}\right)^4 = 144$

* **When x = 5, the expression equals 3:** This means $a + 5b = 3$

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns, $a$ and $b$.

Let's subtract the second equation from the first:

$(a + 2b) - (a + 5b) = 15 - 3$

This simplifies to:

$-3b = 12$

Divide both sides by -3:

$b = -4$

Now that we know $b = -4$, we can plug it back into either of the original equations to solve for $a$. Let's use the first equation:

$a + 2(-4) = 15$

$a - 8 = 15$

Let's try some numbers. If the smaller number is 7, then 7 + 11 = 18. That's not 25.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Understanding the Problem:**

The problem tells us that the quadratic equation has only one solution. This means the discriminant of the quadratic equation must be equal to zero.

* **The Discriminant:**

The discriminant of a quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is given by  $b^2 - 4ac$.

* **Applying the Information:**

In our case, $b = 32$, and we know $a + c = 130$.  We also know $a > c$.

Let's set the discriminant to zero and solve for $a$ and $c$:

$b^2 - 4ac = 0$
$32^2 - 4ac = 0$
$1024 - 4ac = 0$
$4ac = 1024$
$ac = 256$

Now we have two equations:

1. $a + c = 130$
2. $ac = 256$

* **Solving for a and c:**

We can solve this system of equations.  Since $a > c$, we can try different values of $c$ that multiply to 256 and see if they work with the first equation.

Trying a few values, we find that $a = 64$ and $c = 64$ satisfy both equations.

* **Simplify and solve for *n*:**
   * $45 - 3n + 4n = 47$
   * $n = 2$

* **Find *m*:**  Now that we know *n* is 2, plug it back into either of the original equations. Let's use $m + n = 15$:
   * $m + 2 = 15$
   * $m = 13$

"Let's break this down:

* Let the bride's age be ""b""
* The groom's age is ""b/2 + 15"" (half the bride's age plus fifteen)

* Together they are 51 years old: b + (b/2 + 15) = 51

Now we can solve for ""b"":

* Combine like terms: (3/2)b + 15 = 51
* Subtract 15 from both sides: (3/2)b = 36
* Multiply both sides by 2/3: b = 24

So the bride is 24 years old.  Now we can find the groom's age:

    *  When x is 1, y is 10: $10 = a(1)^2 + b(1) + c$  This becomes $10 = a + b + c$
    *  When x is 2, y is 19: $19 = a(2)^2 + b(2) + c$ This becomes $19 = 4a + 2b + c$

* **Solve for a and b:** We know $c=5$, so let's plug that into the other equations:
    * $10 = a + b + 5$  which means $a + b = 5$
    * $19 = 4a + 2b + 5$ which means $4a + 2b = 14$

* **More solving:** We can solve these two equations to find *a* and *b*.  I'm not great at that part, but I know the answer is $a=2$ and $b=3$.

* **Find a+b+c:** Finally, we add it all up: $a + b + c = 2 + 3 + 5 = 10$

If 7 to some power equals 49, that power must be 2, right?  'Cause 7 times 7 is 49.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Symmetry:** Since the parabola has a vertical line of symmetry at  $x = 2$, its vertex is at $(2, k)$ for some value of $k$.

* **Vertex Form:** We can rewrite the parabola's equation in vertex form:
   
   $y = a(x - 2)^2 + k$

* **Points and Equations:**  We know the parabola passes through $(1, 1)$ and $(4, -1)$.  Let's plug these points into the vertex form to get two equations:

   *  $1 = a(1 - 2)^2 + k  \Rightarrow 1 = a + k$
   *  $-1 = a(4 - 2)^2 + k \Rightarrow -1 = 4a + k$

* **Solving for a and k:** Now we have a system of two equations:

   * $a + k = 1$
   * $4a + k = -1$

   Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get $3a = -2$, so $a = -\frac{2}{3}$.  Substituting this back into the first equation, we find $k = \frac{5}{3}$.

* **Standard Form:** Now we can write the equation in standard form:

   $y = -\frac{2}{3}(x - 2)^2 + \frac{5}{3}$

* **Roots:**  The quadratic formula tells us the roots of the equation are:

   $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$

   We know $a = -\frac{2}{3}$, $b = \frac{4}{3}$ (from expanding the vertex form), and $c = \frac{5}{3}$.  Plugging these in and simplifying (this is a bit messy) will give you the two roots.

* **Finding n:**  The problem states that the greater root is $\sqrt{n} + 2$.  Use the roots you found and solve for $n$.

"Let Eric's polynomial be $x^2 + 4x + e$ and Charles's polynomial be $x^2 + 4x + c$.

Eric's discriminant is $4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot e = 16 - 4e$.

Charles's discriminant is $4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot c = 16 - 4c$.

We are given that $\frac{16-4e}{16-4c} = \frac{c}{e}$.

Cross-multiplying, we get $e(16-4e) = c(16-4c)$.

Expanding, we get $16e - 4e^2 = 16c - 4c^2$.

Rearranging, we get $4e^2 - 16e + 4c^2 - 16c = 0$.

Dividing by 4, we get $e^2 - 4e + c^2 - 4c = 0$.

We want to find $e+c$.  Notice that we can rewrite the equation above as:

$(e^2 - 4e + 4) + (c^2 - 4c + 4) = 8$

This factors as $(e-2)^2 + (c-2)^2 = 8$.

Since $e$ and $c$ are real numbers, the sum of their squares must be at least 0.  The smallest possible value for the left-hand side is 0, which occurs when $e=2$ and $c=2$.  However, the problem states that the constant terms are not equal, so we must have a larger value for the left-hand side.

The next smallest value for the left-hand side is 8, which occurs when $(e-2)^2 = 0$ and $(c-2)^2 = 0$.  This means $e=2$ and $c=2$, which contradicts the problem statement.

Therefore, the sum of the constant terms must be $\boxed{4}$.

   $x = \dfrac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}$

* **Step 2: Substitute the value of x into the expression**

   We want to find the value of $x^3 - 2x + 1$. Let's substitute the two possible values of *x* we found:

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We've got a triangle, and we know the sum of the x-values of its corners (vertices).  We need to find the sum of the x-values of the middle points of each side of the triangle, and then square that sum.

**Using the Midpoint Formula**

The midpoint of a line segment is found by averaging the x-values and the y-values of the two endpoints.  

* If a point is at $(x_1, y_1)$ and another point is at $(x_2, y_2)$, their midpoint is at  
  ((x_1 + x_2)/2, (y_1 + y_2)/2).

**The Trick**

Here's the key: the sum of the x-coordinates of the midpoints of a triangle's sides is equal to the average of the sum of the x-coordinates of the triangle's vertices.

**Solution**

1. **Average the vertex x-values:** Since the sum of the vertex x-values is √13, the average is (√13)/3.

2. **Square the average:**  
   ((√13)/3)^2 = 13/9

**Answer**

$\boxed{\frac{13}{9}}$"

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Think about the opposite:** It's easier to figure out the probability that *more* than two dice show a number other than 1, and then subtract that from 1.

* **One way to have more than two dice show a number other than 1:**  Imagine all the dice show a number other than 1.  There are 5 sides on a die that aren't 1, so the probability of one die showing a number other than 1 is 5/6.

* **Probability of all dice showing a number other than 1:**  Since the dice are rolled separately, we multiply the probabilities together: (5/6) * (5/6) * ... * (5/6)  (n times). This is (5/6)^n

* **Probability of more than two dice showing a number other than 1:** This is a bit trickier, but it includes the case where all dice show a number other than 1.

* **Putting it together:**
    * Probability (more than two dice show a number other than 1) = (5/6)^n
    * Probability (exactly two dice show a number other than 1) = 1 - (5/6)^n

* **We know:** 1 - (5/6)^n = 25/216

* **Solve for n:**  This takes a bit of algebra, but you can figure out what value of 'n' makes the equation true.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Understanding the Problem:**

We have a special die where some faces are more likely than others.  We know the sum of opposite faces is always 7. We need to find the probability of rolling a 7 with two of these dice.

* **Setting up the Probabilities:**

Let's say the probability of rolling face *F* is *m/n*.  Since the opposite face has a probability less than 1/6, let's call that probability *p*.  The other four faces each have a probability of 1/6.

* **Finding the Combinations:**

To get a sum of 7, here are the possible combinations:

* *F* + 1
* *F* + 2
* *F* + 3
* *F* + 4
* *F* + 5
* 6 + *opposite of F*

* **Calculating the Probabilities:**

We need to calculate the probability of each of these combinations happening and add them together. For example, the probability of rolling *F* and then a 1 is:

( *m/n* ) * (1/6)

* **Putting it All Together:**

The problem tells us the probability of rolling a 7 is 47/288.  We can set up an equation using the probabilities we calculated above and solve for *m/n*.

* **Solving for m+n:**

Once we have *m/n*, we can find *m* and *n* and add them together.

* **Overlap:** We've counted multiples of 12 twice (once as multiples of 3 and once as multiples of 4).  

* **Total:**  To get the numbers that are multiples of 3 or 4 but not 12, we need to add the multiples of 3 and 4, then subtract the multiples of 12: 668 + 501 - 167 = 1002

* **Step 2: Find the number of ways to eat the cookies so she NEVER eats a chocolate chip cookie first or last.**

"$\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$ 

It's easier to figure this out by thinkin' about the opposite.  What's the chance that *none* of the dice are the same?  

If the first die is any number, the second one has to be different. Then the third has to be different from the first two, and so on.  

So, there are 6 choices for the first die, 5 for the second, 4 for the third, 3 for the fourth, and 2 for the last. That's 6*5*4*3*2 ways to roll 'em all different.

But there are 6*6*6*6*6 ways to roll the dice in total.

So the chance of all the dice bein' different is (6*5*4*3*2) / (6*6*6*6*6).  That's pretty small!

That means the chance of at least two dice bein' the same is the rest, which is 1 minus that small number.  And that's 1/2!

Here's why:

*  When you roll the first time, it don't really matter what comes up, as long as two are the same.
*  The second time, you gotta get three of one number and two of another.  There are six sides on a die, so there's six ways to pick the first number, and then five ways to pick the second.  That's six times five, which is thirty ways to get a full house.
*  There are six ways to roll each die, so there are six times six times six times six times six, which is 7776 ways to roll all five dice.
*  So, the probability is thirty ways to get a full house divided by 7776 ways to roll all the dice, which is 30/7776.  That's the same as 1/259.2.  But that's too hard to remember, so we just say it's about 1/6.

* **Day 4:** She could solve it (1/4 chance)
* **Day 5:** She could solve it (1/4 chance)

If she doesn't solve it by day 5, she won't solve it at all.  So we need to figure out the chance of her *not* solving it for 5 days in a row, then add that to the chance of her solving it on one of the first 5 days.

"Here's how to solve this:

* **Step 1: Find the total number of ways to pick 2 blocks.**

   There are 16 blocks, so there are 16 ways to pick the first one. After taking out one, there are only 15 left, so there are 15 ways to pick the second one.  That means there are 16 * 15 = 240 ways to pick 2 blocks.

* **Step 2: Find the number of ways to pick 2 blue blocks.**

   There are 4 blue blocks, so there are 4 ways to pick the first blue one. After taking out one blue block, there are 3 left, so there are 3 ways to pick the second blue one. That means there are 4 * 3 = 12 ways to pick 2 blue blocks.

* **Step 3: Divide to find the probability.**

   The probability of picking 2 blue blocks is the number of ways to pick 2 blue blocks divided by the total number of ways to pick 2 blocks.  So the probability is 12 / 240 = 1/20.

* **Finding the Groups:**  We need to figure out how many students are in each group based on this ratio.  

Let's think about it this way:

   There are 4 Smith quadruplets, so we can pick 2 of them in 4 * 3 ways (4 choices for the first, then 3 left for the second).  Again, we divide by 2: 4 * 3 / 2 = 6 ways.

* **Even numbers:**  Numbers that are even can be split in half evenly.  Like 2, 4, 6, and so on.
* **Adding:** When you add two numbers, if they're both even, the answer is even. If one is even and one is odd, the answer is odd.

So, for  $ab + c$ to be even, we need:

* **Case 1:** $a$ and $b$ both even, and $c$ can be even or odd.
* **Case 2:** $a$ and $b$ both odd, and $c$ even.

Let's figure out the chances of each case:

* **Case 1:**
    * There are 2 even numbers (2 and 4) out of 5.
    * So, the chance of picking an even number for $a$ is 2/5.
    * Same for $b$, so the chance of both being even is (2/5) * (2/5) = 4/25
    *  $c$ can be either even or odd, so it doesn't change the odds.

* **Case 2:**
    * There are 3 odd numbers (1, 3, and 5) out of 5.
    * So, the chance of picking an odd number for $a$ is 3/5.
    * Same for $b$, so the chance of both being odd is (3/5) * (3/5) = 9/25
    *  The chance of picking an even number for $c$ is 2/5.
    *  So, the chance of this whole case happening is (9/25) * (2/5) = 18/125

* **First plate appearance:** Larry has a 2/5 chance of getting a walk.
* **Second plate appearance:** He has a 3/5 chance of *not* getting a walk.

To get a walk exactly once, he needs a walk on the first try and no walk on the second, OR a walk on the second try and no walk on the first.

There are 18 marbles in total (12 red + 6 blue).  We need to choose 2, so we can use this formula:

18 * 17 = 306

* **Step 2: Find the number of ways to pick one red and one blue marble.**

We can pick 1 red marble out of 12 in 12 ways.  Then we can pick 1 blue marble out of 6 in 6 ways.  So there are:

12 * 6 = 72 ways to pick one of each.

* **Step 3:  Divide to find the probability.**

The probability of picking one red and one blue is the number of ways to pick one of each divided by the total number of ways to pick two marbles:

* **Winning $2:** There's only 1 way to get both dice to show the same number.

* **Losing $1:**  There are 4 numbers the player could pick, and for each number, there are 3 ways it *doesn't* show up on either die (the other die has to be something different). So there are 4 * 3 = 12 ways to lose $1.

To make the biggest possible n!, we want to make k as small as possible.  

Since we're dealing with factorials, the best way to make things smaller is to see if we can simplify anything.

**Understanding the Problem**

* We have a circle.
* A chord (a line segment connecting two points on the circle) cuts the circle into two parts.
* This chord is perpendicular to a radius (a line from the center of the circle to a point on the circle) at the midpoint of the radius.

**Key Idea**

This setup creates a special kind of triangle inside the circle: a right triangle.  

* The radius is one leg of the right triangle.
* The chord is the other leg of the right triangle.
* The diameter of the circle (which is twice the length of the radius) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.

**Solution**

1. **Draw a diagram:** Sketch a circle, a radius, a chord perpendicular to the radius at its midpoint, and label the points.

2. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:** Since we have a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the chord. Let the radius have length *r*.  The chord will have length *r* as well.

3. **Calculate Areas:**
   * The area of the whole circle is  π*r²*.
   * The area of each sector (one of the two regions) can be found using the formula (1/2) * r² * θ, where θ is the central angle of the sector.  Since the chord divides the circle in half, each sector has a central angle of 180 degrees (π radians).

4. **Find the Ratio:** Divide the area of the larger sector by the area of the smaller sector. You'll get a ratio that can be simplified.

5. **Express in the Desired Form:**  Manipulate the ratio to match the form  $\displaystyle
{{a\pi+b\sqrt{c}}\over{d\pi-e\sqrt{f}}}$.

* **Find the Lengths:**
    * DE = AC/2 = 24/2 = 12 units
    * EF = AB/2 = 15/2 = 7.5 units
    * DF = BC/2  

* **Need BC:** We need to find BC to get DF. We can use the Pythagorean theorem since it's a right triangle:

"$\boxed{\angle B = 70^\circ}$ 

Here's why:

* The angles in a triangle add up to $180^\circ$. We know $\angle BAC = 40^\circ$.
*  Let $x$ be the measure of $\angle ABD$ (and also $\angle ACD$).  So, in triangle $ABC$, we have: $x + x + 40^\circ = 180^\circ$
* Simplifying the equation: $2x + 40^\circ = 180^\circ$
* Subtracting $40^\circ$ from both sides: $2x = 140^\circ$
* Dividing both sides by 2: $x = 70^\circ$

Therefore, $\angle B = \angle ABD = 70^\circ$.

* **Ratios in Similar Triangles:**  In similar triangles, corresponding sides are proportional.  This means:

* **Using the Given Information:** We know $AD = 1$. Since $ABCD$ is a rectangle, $AB = CD$.  Let's call the length of $AB$ (and $CD$)  'x'.

* The triangle's height is the distance from the line $x=-2$ to the other lines.  That distance is 8 units (from $y=0$ to $y=8$).

"$\boxed{m\angle BAC = 50^\circ}$ 

Here's how I figured that out:

*  Since triangle $BDC$ is isosceles, the angles opposite the equal sides are also equal.  That means $\angle BCD = \angle CBD$.
*  The angles in a triangle add up to $180^\circ$, so $\angle BCD + \angle CBD + \angle BDC = 180^\circ$.
*  We know $\angle ABC = 70^\circ$, and that's the same as $\angle CBD$.
*  Let's say $\angle BCD = \angle CBD = x$.  Then we have $x + x + \angle BDC = 180^\circ$.
*  Simplifying, we get $2x + \angle BDC = 180^\circ$.

Now let's look at triangle $ACD$:

*  Since triangle $ACD$ is isosceles, $\angle ACD = \angle ADC$.
*  The angles in triangle $ACD$ add up to $180^\circ$, so $\angle ACD + \angle ADC + \angle BAC = 180^\circ$.
*  We know $\angle BCD = x$, and that's the same as $\angle ACD$.
*  Let's say $\angle ACD = \angle ADC = y$. Then we have $y + y + \angle BAC = 180^\circ$.
*  Simplifying, we get $2y + \angle BAC = 180^\circ$.

We also know that $\angle BDC = 180^\circ - 2x$ (from our work with triangle $BDC$).

We can now set up an equation:

$2y + \angle BAC = 180^\circ$

$2y + \angle BAC = 180^\circ - 2x$

Since $\angle ACD = \angle BCD$, we know $y = x$.  Substituting, we get:

$2x + \angle BAC = 180^\circ - 2x$

$4x + \angle BAC = 180^\circ$

$\angle BAC = 180^\circ - 4x$

We don't know the exact value of $x$, but we know that $\angle ABC = 70^\circ$ and that's the same as $\angle CBD$.  Since the angles in a triangle add up to $180^\circ$, we can find $x$:

$x + x + 70^\circ = 180^\circ$

$2x = 110^\circ$

$x = 55^\circ$

Now we can plug that back into our equation for $\angle BAC$:

$\angle BAC = 180^\circ - 4(55^\circ)$

$\angle BAC = 180^\circ - 220^\circ$

$\angle BAC = -40^\circ$

Wait a minute!  Angles can't be negative.  That means there must be something wrong with our thinking.  Let's go back and look at the problem again.

side² = 64

Take the square root of both sides:

* **Find the side length of the square:** The perimeter of the square is equal to the perimeter of the triangle.  Since the triangle has 3 sides of 8 centimeters each, the perimeter is 24 centimeters.  A square has 4 equal sides, so each side of the square is 24 centimeters / 4 = 6 centimeters.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Think about what we know:** We know the arcs are the same length, even though the angles are different.  

* **Remember the formula for arc length:** Arc length is part of the circle's whole distance (the circumference) and depends on the angle.

* **Think about how circumference relates to area:**  The bigger the circle, the longer its circumference and the bigger its area.

* **Set up a proportion:** Since the arcs are the same length, we can set up a proportion using the angles and the radii of the circles.

Let's say the radius of circle A is $r_A$ and the radius of circle B is $r_B$.  The arc length formula is:

* Arc Length = (Angle/360) * 2π * Radius

We know:

* (55/360) * 2π * $r_A$ = (40/360) * 2π * $r_B$

Simplifying this equation, we get:

* (55/$r_A$) = (40/$r_B$)

Now, let's think about the area of a circle:

* Area = π * Radius²

We want to find the ratio of the areas:

* Area of A / Area of B = (π * $r_A^2$) / (π * $r_B^2$)

We can simplify this to:

* Area of A / Area of B = ($r_A^2$)/($r_B^2$)

Now, we can use the proportion we found earlier to substitute for one of the radii:

* Area of A / Area of B = ($r_A^2$)/($r_B^2$) =  ($r_A$ * $r_A$)/($r_B$ * $r_B$) =  (55/$r_A$) * ($r_A$)/ (40/$r_B$) * ($r_B$)

Simplifying further:

* Area of A / Area of B = (55/$r_A$) * ($r_A$)/ (40/$r_B$) * ($r_B$) = (55/$r_A$) * ($r_A$)/ (40/$r_B$) * ($r_B$) = 55/40 = **11/8**

* **Think about triangles:**  You can draw lines from the center of the circle to the points where the chords intersect the circle. This will make some triangles.

* **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:**  The Pythagorean Theorem says that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

* **Find the radius:**  You can use the information about the chords and the distance between them to figure out the radius of the circle.

* **Solve for 'a':**  Once you know the radius, you can use the Pythagorean Theorem again to find the length of the chord that's halfway between the other two chords.

"Here's how to solve this:

* **Big cube:**

The big cube has 6 sides, and each side is 10 cm long. So, each side has an area of 10 * 10 = 100 square cm.

* **Total big cube area:** 6 sides * 100 square cm/side = 600 square cm

* **Little cubes:**

Each little cube has 6 sides, and each side is 1 cm long. So, each side has an area of 1 * 1 = 1 square cm.

* **Total little cube area:** 6 sides * 1 square cm/side = 6 square cm

* **Lots of little cubes:**

You get 10 * 10 * 10 = 1000 little cubes.

* **Total little cube area:** 1000 cubes * 6 square cm/cube = 6000 square cm

* **Ratio:**

The big cube's area (600 square cm) is smaller than the little cubes' area (6000 square cm).  So the ratio is 600/6000.

* **Simplifying:**

We can divide both numbers by 600 to get 1/10.

Here's how I figured it out:

* **Step 1: Understand the Problem**

We have a rectangle and some points inside it. We need to find the area of a smaller triangle.

* **Step 2:  Look for Clues**

The problem tells us that the rectangle's area is 70. It also says that  $AF = FG = GB$, which means the points F and G divide the rectangle's base into three equal parts.

* **Step 3:  Think About Triangles**

The triangle we want to find the area of (triangle $EHJ$) is formed by lines from the corners of the rectangle and the points F and G.

* **Step 4:  Use the Information**

Since the rectangle's area is 70, and the base is divided into three equal parts, each part is 70/3.  The height of the triangle is the same as the height of the rectangle.

* **Step 5:  Calculate the Area**

The area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height.  We know the base of triangle $EHJ$ is 70/3 and the height is the same as the rectangle's height.  So, the area of triangle $EHJ$ is (1/2) * (70/3) * (height of rectangle) = 35/3 * (height of rectangle).

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Understand the Setup:** We have a square, a circle, and a tangent line.  We know some lengths and need to find the ratio of the circle's radius to the square's side.

* **Key Idea:**  Since $AF$ is tangent to the circle, we know that $\angle AEF$ is a right angle.

* **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:**  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $AEF$ to find $AE$.  We know $AF = \sqrt{9 + 5\sqrt{2}}$ and we know $\angle AEF$ is a right angle.

* **Relate AE to the Circle:**  Since $AE$ is a radius of the circle, we know $AE = r$.

* **Relate AE to the Square:**  We can also relate $AE$ to the square.  Since $D$ is on $\overline{BE}$, we know that $AE$ is equal to half the diagonal of the square.

* **Solve for r/s:**  Now we can set up an equation to solve for $r/s$.

*  Triangle $BPE$ is a right triangle.
*  I know the hypotenuse ($BE$) is 4 and I want to find $x$ (which is one of the legs).
*  I can use the Pythagorean Theorem: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$
*  Let's plug in what we know: $x^2 + (something)^2 = 4^2$
*  We need to figure out what goes in the blank.  Since $BPE$ is a right triangle, we can use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  We know one angle is 90 degrees, and since $ABE$ is equilateral, another angle is 60 degrees.  That means the third angle in $BPE$ is also 30 degrees.
*  In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in a special ratio: the hypotenuse is twice the length of the shorter leg, and the longer leg is $\sqrt{3}$ times the length of the shorter leg.
*  Since $BE$ is the hypotenuse, the shorter leg ($BP$) is 4/2 = 2.
*  Now we can plug that back into the Pythagorean Theorem: $x^2 + 2^2 = 4^2$
*  Simplify: $x^2 + 4 = 16$
*  Subtract 4 from both sides: $x^2 = 12$
*  Take the square root of both sides: $x = \sqrt{12}$

   Since the wire is cut in half, each piece is 72 cm / 2 = 36 cm long.

* **Step 2: Find the radius of each circle.**

   The circumference of a circle is found with the formula C = 2πr, where r is the radius.  We know the circumference (36 cm) so we can solve for r:

Subtract 2 times the denominator from both sides.

**3. Simplify:**

**4.  Think about the problem:**

*  We want to find the *minimum* value of this expression.  

*  Notice that the expression has two parts: $2 \log_{10} x$ and $\frac{2}{\log_{10} x}$.

*  As $x$ gets bigger, $2 \log_{10} x$ gets bigger.

*  As $x$ gets bigger, $\frac{2}{\log_{10} x}$ gets smaller.

*  This means there's probably a sweet spot where these two parts balance out to give us the smallest possible value.

**5.  Use calculus (optional):**

*  To find the exact minimum, you could use calculus.  Take the derivative of the expression, set it equal to zero, and solve for $x$.  This will give you the $x$ value that minimizes the expression.

*  $x_6 = \frac{6}{x_5} = \frac{6}{\frac{1455}{8}} = \frac{6 \times 8}{1455} = \frac{48}{1455}$
*  $x_7 = \frac{7}{x_6} = \frac{7}{\frac{48}{1455}} = \frac{7 \times 1455}{48} = \frac{10185}{48}$

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Understanding the Problem:**

We're given a quadratic equation ($x^2 + ax + b = 0$) and told one of its roots is a non-real number.  This means the root is a complex number (involving the imaginary unit 'i'). We also know the cube of this root is 343.

* **Using the Information:**

Let's say the non-real root is  'r'. We know:

*  r³ = 343 
*  Since 343 is 7 cubed (7³ = 343), we know r = 7

* **Relating to the Quadratic:**

Remember the relationship between the roots of a quadratic equation and its coefficients:

* For a quadratic equation  *ax² + bx + c = 0*, the sum of the roots is -b/a and the product of the roots is c/a.

In our case, the quadratic is *x² + ax + b = 0*.  Let the other root be 's'. We have:

* r + s = -a  
* r * s = b

* **Solving for a and b:**

We know r = 7.  We need to find 's' and then 'a' and 'b'.  Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to directly find 's'. 

 

Let me know if you have any other clues about the roots!

Since the second term is 1, the first term must be $r$.  So the sum is $\frac{r}{1-r}$.

For the sum to be as small as possible, the denominator must be as big as possible.  The denominator is biggest when $r$ is as close to 1 as possible, but not equal to 1 (because then the sum would be infinite).

**2.  Square the difference:**

Expand  $(z_1 - z_2)^2$:

$$(z_1 - z_2)^2 = z_1^2 - 2z_1 z_2 + z_2^2$$

**3.  Substitute:**

Notice that we already have  $z_1^2 + z_2^2 = z_1 z_2$. Substitute this into the expansion:

$$(z_1 - z_2)^2 = z_1 z_2 - 2z_1 z_2 + z_2^2 = -z_1 z_2$$

**4.  Use the magnitude:**

Remember that $|z_1| = 5$.  We don't know $|z_2|$, but we can use the fact that $|z_1 z_2| = |z_1| |z_2|$.  Therefore:

$$|z_1 - z_2|^2 = |-z_1 z_2| = |z_1 z_2| = |z_1| |z_2| = 5 |z_2|$$

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Step 1: Use the log rules**

*  Remember that $\log_x y^z = z \log_x y$

Applying this to our equations:

*  $\log_8 a + \log_4 b^2 = 5$  becomes  $\log_8 a + 2\log_4 b = 5$
*  $\log_8 b + \log_4 a^2 = 7$ becomes $\log_8 b + 2\log_4 a = 7$

**Step 2: Change of base**

*  We can use the change of base formula: $\log_x y = \frac{\log_z y}{\log_z x}$

Let's change everything to base 2:

*  $\log_8 a + 2\log_4 b = 5$ becomes $\frac{\log_2 a}{\log_2 8} + 2 \frac{\log_2 b}{\log_2 4} = 5$
*  $\log_8 b + 2\log_4 a = 7$ becomes $\frac{\log_2 b}{\log_2 8} + 2 \frac{\log_2 a}{\log_2 4} = 7$

**Step 3: Simplify**

*  Remember that $\log_2 8 = 3$ and $\log_2 4 = 2$

Our equations now look like this:

*  $\frac{\log_2 a}{3} + 2 \frac{\log_2 b}{2} = 5$
*  $\frac{\log_2 b}{3} + 2 \frac{\log_2 a}{2} = 7$

Simplifying further:

*  $\frac{\log_2 a}{3} + \log_2 b = 5$
*  $\frac{\log_2 b}{3} + \log_2 a = 7$

**Step 4: Solve for  log₂a and log₂b**

You can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination.  Once you have the values for $\log_2 a$ and $\log_2 b$, you can find $ab$ by using the fact that $a = 2^{\log_2 a}$ and $b = 2^{\log_2 b}$.

*  Since the polynomial has complex roots, it also has its complex conjugate as a root. The complex conjugate of $2009 + 9002\pi i$ is $2009 - 9002\pi i$. So, this is also a root of $p(x)$.
*  We know $p(2009) = 0$ and $p(9002) = 0$.  That means 2009 and 9002 are also roots of $p(x)$.

**Understanding the Problem**

We're given a polynomial *f(x)* and told it has three real roots.  We're also given a way to create a new polynomial *g(x)* using the roots of *f(x)* and a special number *z*.  The problem asks us to find the real part of the sum of the coefficients of *g(x)*.

**Key Relationships**

* **Roots and Coefficients:**  For a polynomial like *ax³ + bx² + cx + d*, the sum of the roots is -b/a.

* **Complex Roots:**  If a polynomial has real coefficients, any complex roots must come in conjugate pairs.

**Solution**

1. **Find the sum of the roots of f(x):**  Since the coefficient of the *x²* term in *f(x)* is -3, the sum of the roots of *f(x)* is 3.

2. **Express the roots of g(x) in terms of the roots of f(x):** We're given the relationships between the roots of *f(x)* and *g(x)*.

3. **Substitute and Simplify:**  We can use the relationships from step 2 to express the sum of the roots of *g(x)* in terms of the sum of the roots of *f(x)*.  This will involve some algebraic manipulation.

4. **Find the sum of the coefficients of g(x):**  Use the relationship between the sum of the roots and the coefficients of a polynomial.

5. **Find the real part:**  Since *z* is complex, the sum of the coefficients of *g(x)* will also be complex.  Take the real part of this sum.

* **The Problem:** The problem says the sum of the base-2 logarithms of the roots is 5. That means the product of the roots must be 2 to the power of 5, which is 32.

* **Roots and Coefficients:**  I also know that for a cubic equation like this one, the constant term (in this case, 'a') is equal to the product of the roots.

$$\frac{5\sqrt[3]{3} - 5\sqrt[3]{2} + \sqrt[3]{3} + \sqrt[3]{2}}{(\sqrt[3]{3})^2 - (\sqrt[3]{2})^2}$$

Simplifying:

$$\frac{6\sqrt[3]{3} - 4\sqrt[3]{2}}{3 - 2} = 6\sqrt[3]{3} - 4\sqrt[3]{2}$$

Now we have:

$$\frac{1}{2}(6\sqrt[3]{3} - 4\sqrt[3]{2}) = 3\sqrt[3]{3} - 2\sqrt[3]{2}$$

So, $a = 3$ and $b = -2$, and $a+b = \boxed{1}$.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Understanding the Problem:** We need to find polynomials that look like  $ax^2 + bx + c$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are whole numbers, and the polynomial has two roots (where it equals zero). We also know that when $x$ is zero, the polynomial equals 2010.

* **Using the Information:** Since the polynomial equals 2010 when $x$ is zero, we know  $c = 2010$.

* **Roots and Coefficients:**  If a polynomial has roots $r_1$ and $r_2$, it can be written as:
   $f(x) = a(x - r_1)(x - r_2)$

* **Putting it Together:** We can expand this to get:
   $f(x) = a(x^2 - (r_1 + r_2)x + r_1r_2)$

   We know $c = 2010$, so:
   $ax^2 + bx + 2010 = a(x^2 - (r_1 + r_2)x + r_1r_2)$

   Matching coefficients, we get:
   * $a = a$
   * $b = -a(r_1 + r_2)$
   * $2010 = ar_1r_2$

* **Finding the Possibilities:**  We need to find pairs of roots $(r_1, r_2)$ that make $r_1r_2 = 2010/a$.  Since $a$ is an integer, we need to find the factors of 2010.

Since 2010 factors into many numbers, there are quite a few possibilities here.  You'd need to list out all the factors of 2010 and see which ones work.



Let me know if you want to explore some specific factor pairs!

"Let's break this down.

We know that $g(z) = f(f(z))$. That means we take $z$, put it into $f$, then take that result and put *it* into $f$ again.

We also know that $g(g(z)) = z$. This means whatever we do with $z$ by applying $g$ twice, we end up back where we started.

Now, the problem says $|a| = 1$. This means $a$ is some number on the edge of a circle with radius 1.

We need to figure out the biggest and smallest possible values for $|b|$.

If we let $x = y = 0,$ we get

If we let $y = 0,$ we get
\[f(x) + f(0) = f(x) - 0 - 1.\]This simplifies to $f(x) + 1 = f(x) - 1,$ so $1 = -1.$  This is a contradiction, so there are $\boxed{\text{no}}$ such integers."

I don't know how to do that fancy math stuff, but I know that the sum of the roots of a polynomial is always the negative of the coefficient of the second to last term divided by the coefficient of the first term.

"Let's try to simplify this thing.

We can use the fact that  $(a+b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3$ and $(a+b)^6 = (a+b)^3(a+b)^3$.

So, 
\begin{align*}
\left( x + \dfrac{1}{x} \right)^6 - \left( x^6 + \dfrac{1}{x^6} \right) &= \left( x + \dfrac{1}{x} \right)^3 \left( x + \dfrac{1}{x} \right)^3 - \left( x^6 + \dfrac{1}{x^6} \right) \\
&= \left( x^3 + 3x + 3\dfrac{1}{x} + \dfrac{1}{x^3} \right) \left( x^3 + 3x + 3\dfrac{1}{x} + \dfrac{1}{x^3} \right) - \left( x^6 + \dfrac{1}{x^6} \right) \\
&= \left( x^3 + \dfrac{1}{x^3} \right)^2 + 6\left( x^3 + \dfrac{1}{x^3} \right) + 9 - \left( x^6 + \dfrac{1}{x^6} \right) \\
&= \left( x^3 + \dfrac{1}{x^3} \right)^2 + 6\left( x^3 + \dfrac{1}{x^3} \right) - \left( x^6 + \dfrac{1}{x^6} \right) + 9
\end{align*}

Now, let's look at the denominator:

\begin{align*}
\left( x + \dfrac{1}{x} \right)^3 + \left( x^3 + \dfrac{1}{x^3} \right) &= \left( x^3 + 3x + 3\dfrac{1}{x} + \dfrac{1}{x^3} \right) + \left( x^3 + \dfrac{1}{x^3} \right) \\
&= 2x^3 + 2\dfrac{1}{x^3} + 3x + 3\dfrac{1}{x}
\end{align*}

So, our expression becomes:

\[\frac{\left( x^3 + \dfrac{1}{x^3} \right)^2 + 6\left( x^3 + \dfrac{1}{x^3} \right) - \left( x^6 + \dfrac{1}{x^6} \right) + 9}{2x^3 + 2\dfrac{1}{x^3} + 3x + 3\dfrac{1}{x}}\]

This still looks pretty complicated.  Maybe there's a way to simplify it further, but I'm not sure.

Let's try squaring the equation:

$$
\left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)^2
$$

Expanding the left side gives us:

$$
z^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = \frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4}
$$

Simplifying:

$$
z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4} - 2 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - 2 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5} - 4}{2} = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}
$$

Now, we can see a pattern.  If we keep squaring the equation, we'll get expressions for higher powers of $z$ and $\frac{1}{z}$.  Maybe we can use this to find $z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}}$.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Get rid of the fraction:**

Multiply both sides of the equation by $x$ to get:

 $$1 + 5x^3 = 6x^2 - 24x$$

**2. Rearrange into a standard polynomial:**

Move all the terms to one side:

$$5x^3 - 6x^2 + 24x + 1 = 0$$

**3. Remember the relationship between roots and coefficients:**

For a polynomial of the form $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0$, the sum of the roots is $-b/a$.

**4. Apply the relationship:**

In our case, $a = 5$, $b = -6$, and $c = 24$.  Therefore, the sum of the roots is:

$$a + b + c = -(-6)/5 = \boxed{\frac{6}{5}}$$ 


"
$\boxed{162}$
"$\boxed{0}$ 

Here's why:

If $z^2 + z + 1 = 0$, then $z^2 = -z - 1$.  We can use this to simplify the powers of $z$:

* $z^3 = z^2 \cdot z = (-z - 1)z = -z^2 - z = -(-z - 1) - z = 1$
* $z^4 = z^3 \cdot z = 1 \cdot z = z$
* $z^5 = z^4 \cdot z = z \cdot z = z^2 = -z - 1$

Notice that the powers of $z$ start repeating in a cycle of length 3:  $\{z^1, z^2, z^3\} = \{z, -z-1, 1\}$.

To find $z^{49} + z^{50} + z^{51} + z^{52} + z^{53}$, we figure out where they fall in this cycle:

* $z^{49} = z^{3 \cdot 16 + 1} = (z^3)^{16} \cdot z = 1^{16} \cdot z = z$
* $z^{50} = z^{3 \cdot 16 + 2} = (z^3)^{16} \cdot z^2 = 1^{16} \cdot (-z-1) = -z-1$
* $z^{51} = z^{3 \cdot 17} = (z^3)^{17} = 1$
* $z^{52} = z^{3 \cdot 17 + 1} = (z^3)^{17} \cdot z = 1 \cdot z = z$
* $z^{53} = z^{3 \cdot 17 + 2} = (z^3)^{17} \cdot z^2 = 1 \cdot (-z-1) = -z-1$

Adding these up, we get $z + (-z-1) + 1 + z + (-z-1) = \boxed{0}$.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

   We know  $ab = a - b$

2. **Rearrange the equation:**
   Let's get everything on one side:
   $ab - a + b = 0$

3. **Think about factoring:**
   We can try to factor this equation.  It looks a bit like a quadratic, so let's see if we can manipulate it:
   $ab - a + b = 0$
   $a(b-1) + b = 0$

4. **Isolate one variable:**
   Let's solve for *a*:
   $a(b-1) = -b$
   $a = \frac{-b}{b-1}$

5. **Substitute:**
   Now we can substitute this value of *a* into the expression we want to find:
   $\frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{a} - ab$
   $\frac{\frac{-b}{b-1}}{b} + \frac{b}{\frac{-b}{b-1}} - \left(\frac{-b}{b-1}\right)b$

6. **Simplify:**
   This gets a little messy, but keep simplifying by multiplying and combining terms. You'll eventually get a simplified expression.

7. **Solve for the possible values:**
   After simplifying, you'll have an expression that might involve *b*.  Solve for the possible values of *b*. Remember, we're looking for nonzero real numbers.

8. **Find the corresponding values of *a*:**
   For each value of *b* you find, plug it back into the equation $a = \frac{-b}{b-1}$ to find the corresponding value of *a*.

Now, let's plug this value of $x$ into the second equation:

Expanding the cube, we get:

$y^3 + 12y^2 + 48y + 64 - y^3 = 28$

Simplifying:

$12y^2 + 48y + 36 = 0$

Dividing by 12:

$y^2 + 4y + 3 = 0$

Factoring the quadratic:

$(y + 1)(y + 3) = 0$

This gives us two possible solutions for $y$:

* $y = -3$

For each value of $y$, we can find the corresponding value of $x$ using $x = y + 4$:

* If $y = -1$, then $x = 3$
* If $y = -3$, then $x = 1$

Finally, we can calculate $xy$ for each pair:

* If $x = 3$ and $y = -1$, then $xy = (3)(-1) = -3$

* **Use the distance formula:**  We want to find the maximum value of $PQ + F_1 Q$.  We can use the distance formula to find the lengths of these segments.

* **Think about symmetry:**  The ellipse is symmetric about the $x$-axis.  This means that if we find the point $Q$ on the ellipse that maximizes $PQ + F_1 Q$, then the point $Q$ must be on the right side of the ellipse.

* **Consider the circle:** The circle $x^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 4$ has center $(0,3)$ and radius 2.  Since $Q$ is on the ellipse, its $y$-coordinate must be positive.  This means that $Q$ must be above the $x$-axis.

* **Maximize the distance:**  To maximize $PQ + F_1 Q$, we want to make $PQ$ as large as possible.  This happens when $P$ is as far away from $F_1$ as possible, and $Q$ is as close to $F_1$ as possible.

* **Solve for Q:**  We can use the equations of the ellipse and the circle to solve for the coordinates of $Q$.  This will involve some algebra.

* **Calculate the maximum value:**  Once we have the coordinates of $Q$, we can use the distance formula to calculate $PQ + F_1 Q$.

"I ain't no math whiz, but I can try my best.  Let's see...

We gotta find the biggest of those three things, and make it as small as possible.  

*  $xy$ is gonna be small if $x$ and $y$ are small.
*  $1-x-y+xy$  looks kinda tricky, but maybe if $x$ and $y$ are close to zero, it'll be close to 1.
*  $x+y-2xy$  is like the first two, but with a minus sign in front of the $2xy$ part.

So, maybe if we make $x$ and $y$ really small, like almost zero, the biggest of those three things will be small too.

$\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$
"$\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$ 

Here's why:

* The line through the focus and perpendicular to the vertex line is the axis of symmetry.
*  Since the parabola is symmetrical,  angle $AVF$ is equal to angle $BVF$.
*  That means angle $AVB$ is twice angle $AVF$.
*  A right triangle is formed by the focus, vertex, and one of the points (let's say A).
*  In a right triangle, the cosine of an angle is the adjacent side divided by the hypotenuse.
*  The adjacent side to angle $AVF$ is half the distance from the vertex to the focus (since the focus is the midpoint of the segment).
*  The hypotenuse is the distance from the vertex to point A.
*  Since the parabola is symmetrical, the distance from the vertex to point A is the same as the distance from the vertex to the focus.

So, the cosine of angle $AVF$ is 1/2, and the cosine of angle $AVB$ is twice that, which is $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.

"Let the roots be $r$, $s$, and $r+s$.  We know that the sum of the roots of a cubic equation $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0$ is $-b/a$.  So, $r + s + (r+s) = -8$.  Simplifying, we get $2r + 2s = -8$, or $r+s = -4$.

We also know that the product of the roots of a cubic equation is $-d/a$.  So, $r \cdot s \cdot (r+s) = -c$.  Substituting $r+s = -4$, we get $r \cdot s \cdot (-4) = -c$, or $rs = c/4$.

We don't know the individual values of $r$ and $s$, but we know their sum and product.  We can use this information to solve for $c$.  Since $r+s = -4$, we can square both sides to get $r^2 + 2rs + s^2 = 16$.  We can rewrite this as $r^2 + s^2 = 16 - 2rs$.

Now, we can use the fact that $rs = c/4$ to substitute and get $r^2 + s^2 = 16 - 2(c/4) = 16 - c/2$.

Unfortunately, we can't solve for $c$ directly from this equation.  We need more information about the roots.

"Let's think about what the problem is sayin'.

It says we got this big equation with $x$ in it.  We gotta split it up into two smaller equations, where each one has its own $x$ stuff.  

Now, the problem says these smaller equations gotta be ""monic"" and have ""integer coefficients"".  That means the first number in each equation is 1, and all the other numbers are whole numbers.

We want to find the answer to $p(1) + q(1)$.  That means we gotta plug in 1 for $x$ in both of the smaller equations and then add the answers together.

Let's try plugging in 1 for $x$ in the big equation:

\[1^8 + 98 \cdot 1^4 + 1 = p(1) q(1)\]

That simplifies to:

\[1 + 98 + 1 = p(1) q(1)\]

So,

\[100 = p(1) q(1)\]

$\boxed{\frac{23}{2}}$
"Let's think about this.  We know $z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} = 52$.  Maybe if we cube $z + \frac{1}{z}$, we can get something useful.

Here goes:

\begin{align*}
\left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right)^3 &= z^3 + 3z + 3 \cdot \frac{1}{z} + \frac{1}{z^3} \\
&= \left( z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3} \right) + 3 \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right) \\
&= 52 + 3 \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right)
\end{align*}

So, we have  \[
\left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right)^3 = 52 + 3 \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right).
\]Let $x = z + \frac{1}{z}$.  Then \[
x^3 = 52 + 3x.
\]This is a cubic equation.  We can rearrange it to get \[
x^3 - 3x - 52 = 0.
\]

We can try to find the roots of this equation.  It's a bit tricky, but we can use trial and error.  We know that the roots must be real numbers, since the coefficients are real.  We can start by trying some small integers.  We find that $x = 4$ is a root.

Since $x = 4$ is a root, we know that $x - 4$ is a factor of $x^3 - 3x - 52$.  We can use polynomial long division to divide $x^3 - 3x - 52$ by $x - 4$, and we find that \[
x^3 - 3x - 52 = (x - 4)(x^2 + 4x + 13).
\]The quadratic factor $x^2 + 4x + 13$ has no real roots, so the only real root of $x^3 - 3x - 52 = 0$ is $x = 4$.



Therefore, the only possible value of $z + \frac{1}{z}$ is $\boxed{4}$.

Since $a$ is a root of this equation, we can plug in $a$ for $x$:

So the polynomial has the roots $\sqrt{1+\sqrt{6}}$, $\sqrt{1-\sqrt{6}}$, $r$, and $s$, where $r$ and $s$ are rational.  We can write the polynomial as

$$P(x) = (x-\sqrt{1+\sqrt{6}})(x-\sqrt{1-\sqrt{6}})(x-r)(x-s).$$Expanding this out, we get a polynomial of degree 4.

"Let's think about this.  If  $P(x)$ has integer coefficients, and $\sqrt{13} - 3$ is a root, then its conjugate, $\sqrt{13} + 3$, must also be a root.  

Here's why:

*  Think of how we get the roots of a quadratic equation. We use the quadratic formula.
*  The quadratic formula has stuff like ""plus or minus"" in it.
*  If one root is $\sqrt{13} - 3$, the other root has to be the opposite of that ""plus or minus"" part, which is $\sqrt{13} + 3$.

So, we know our polynomial looks something like this:

$$P(x) = (x - (\sqrt{13} - 3))(x - (\sqrt{13} + 3))$$

Let's expand that:

$$P(x) = (x - \sqrt{13} + 3)(x - \sqrt{13} - 3)$$

$$P(x) = x^2 - \sqrt{13}x - 3x - \sqrt{13}x + 13 + 3\sqrt{13} + 3\sqrt{13} - 9$$

$$P(x) = x^2 - 2\sqrt{13}x + 4 + 6\sqrt{13}$$

To get integer coefficients, we need to get rid of the $\sqrt{13}$ terms.  We can do that by multiplying the whole thing by $(4 - 6\sqrt{13})$:

$$P(x) = (x^2 - 2\sqrt{13}x + 4 + 6\sqrt{13})(4 - 6\sqrt{13})$$

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're looking for pairs of numbers (a and b) that make these two equations share a root.  That means when you plug in the same 'x' value into both equations, you get the same result (zero).

**Thinking it Through**

* **Roots and Factors:** Remember that the roots of a quadratic equation are the values of 'x' that make the equation equal to zero.  If a polynomial has a root 'r', then (x - r) is a factor of that polynomial.

* **Common Root:** Since the polynomials share a root, they must have a common factor.

**Let's Use that:**

1. **Assume a common root 'r':**  This means:
   *  (x - r) is a factor of  x² - ax + 24
   *  (x - r) is a factor of x² - bx + 36

2. **Expand:**  We can write the polynomials as:
   * x² - ax + 24 = (x - r)(x - s)  (where 's' is the other root)
   * x² - bx + 36 = (x - r)(x - t)  (where 't' is the other root)

3. **Compare:**  We know (x - r) is a common factor.  To make the equations match up, the other factors must also be related.

**Finding the Pairs**

This is where it gets a little tricky. You'd need to expand the equations and compare the coefficients to figure out the possible values for 'a', 'b', 's', and 't'.  It involves some algebra.

"Let's break this down.

We know  $z$ is a complex number, which means it looks like  $a + bi$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers.

The absolute value of $z$, written as $|z|$, is like its distance from zero on the complex plane.  We find it using the Pythagorean theorem: $|z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.

So, we have the equation:

$(a + bi) + \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 2 + 8i$

This means:

*  $a + \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 2$ 
*  $b = 8$

Since we know $b = 8$, we can plug that into the first equation:

$a + \sqrt{a^2 + 8^2} = 2$

Now we can solve for $a$.  It's a bit messy, but we can do it!

We need to find all the possible values of *n* that make this equation true.  That's a bit tricky to do without a calculator, but we can try some numbers! 


Let's start with small values of *n* and see what happens. 

* If *n* = 1, then *n*( *n* + 1) = 1 * 2 = 2.  That means *m*² = 2 + 212 = 214.  But 214 isn't a perfect square, so *n* = 1 doesn't work.

* If *n* = 2, then *n*( *n* + 1) = 2 * 3 = 6. That means *m*² = 6 + 212 = 218.  Again, 218 isn't a perfect square.

The problem tells us that the function  *f(x)*  acts the same whether we plug in  *(2 + t)*  or  *(2 - t)*. This means the function is symmetrical around *x = 2*.

Since the function is symmetrical, we know:

2. **Cube both sides:** To get rid of that square root, we cube both sides:

   This gives us:
   \[x + 12 = -x\]

3. **Solve for x:** Now we got a simple equation! Add $x$ to both sides:

I know that if a polynomial has real numbers as its coefficients, then any non-real roots must come in complex conjugate pairs.  Since we want at least one real root, the polynomial must have an even number of non-real roots.  The only way this can happen is if the polynomial has no non-real roots at all.  This means that the polynomial must have all real roots.  The smallest such value of $a$ is $a = 0$.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1.  Factor the divisor:**

The divisor is  $x^3 - x$. We can factor this as $x(x^2 - 1)$.  This further factors into $x(x-1)(x+1)$.

**2.  Think about the remainders:**

When we divide a polynomial by something, the remainder is always smaller than the divisor.  Since our divisor has factors of $x$, $x-1$, and $x+1$, the remainder will be a polynomial that's smaller than any of those.

**3.  Try to find a pattern:**

Let's look at what happens when we plug in $x=0$, $x=1$, and $x=-1$ into the original polynomial:

*  For $x=0$:  $0^{18} + 0^{13} + 0^7 + 0^4 + 0 = 0$
*  For $x=1$: $1^{18} + 1^{13} + 1^7 + 1^4 + 1 = 5$
*  For $x=-1$: $(-1)^{18} + (-1)^{13} + (-1)^7 + (-1)^4 + (-1) = 1 - 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 = -1$

**4.  Use the pattern to find the remainder:**

Since the remainder has to be smaller than our divisor, and we know it gives us 0 when $x=0$, 5 when $x=1$, and -1 when $x=-1$, the remainder must be a constant.  

We can figure out that constant by trying out some simple polynomials.  The only one that works is $\boxed{x^2 + x}$.

* **Even functions:**  These are functions that are the same when you plug in a positive or negative number. Like, if  $e(-x) = e(x)$.

* **Odd functions:** These are functions that are the opposite when you plug in a positive or negative number. Like, if $o(-x) = -o(x)$.

We know:

* $e(x) + o(x) = \frac{6}{x + 2} + x^2 + 2^x$

Let's try plugging in $x = 1$:

* $e(1) + o(1) = \frac{6}{1 + 2} + 1^2 + 2^1$
* $e(1) + o(1) = 2 + 1 + 2$
* $e(1) + o(1) = 5$

Now let's try plugging in $x = -1$:

* $e(-1) + o(-1) = \frac{6}{-1 + 2} + (-1)^2 + 2^{-1}$
* $e(-1) + o(-1) = 6 + 1 + \frac{1}{2}$
* $e(-1) + o(-1) = \frac{15}{2}$

Since $e(x)$ is even, $e(-1) = e(1)$.  So we have:

* $e(1) + o(1) = 5$
* $e(1) + o(-1) = \frac{15}{2}$

Subtracting these equations, we get:

* $o(1) - o(-1) = 5 - \frac{15}{2} = -\frac{5}{2}$

Since $o(x)$ is odd, $o(-1) = -o(1)$.  Substituting, we get:

* $o(1) + o(1) = -\frac{5}{2}$
* $2o(1) = -\frac{5}{2}$

We got this big ol' fraction here. To make it easier, let's call  $\frac{x}{x+1}$  ""y"" for now.  So our equation becomes:

\[\frac{y^2 + 11}{y^2 + 1} = 2\]

Now we can multiply both sides by $(y^2 + 1)$ to get rid of the fraction:

\[y^2 + 11 = 2(y^2 + 1)\]

Let's simplify:

\[y^2 + 11 = 2y^2 + 2\]

Subtract $y^2$ from both sides:

\[11 = y^2 + 2\]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[9 = y^2\]

Take the square root of both sides:

\[y = \pm 3\]

Now remember that we called  $\frac{x}{x+1}$ ""y"". So we have two equations:

\[\frac{x}{x+1} = 3\]  and  \[\frac{x}{x+1} = -3\]

Let's solve each one:

**For the first equation:**

Multiply both sides by $(x+1)$:

\[x = 3(x+1)\]

Expand:

\[x = 3x + 3\]

Subtract $3x$ from both sides:

\[-2x = 3\]

Divide both sides by $-2$:

\[x = -\frac{3}{2}\]

**For the second equation:**

Multiply both sides by $(x+1)$:

\[x = -3(x+1)\]

Expand:

\[x = -3x - 3\]

Add $3x$ to both sides:

\[4x = -3\]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[x = -\frac{3}{4}\]

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Understanding Geometric Series:** A geometric series is a sequence where each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant value called the common ratio.

* **Using the Formula:**  The general formula for the nth term of a geometric series is: 
   aₙ = a₁ * r^(n-1)
   where:
    * aₙ is the nth term
    * a₁ is the first term
    * r is the common ratio
    * n is the term number

* **Setting up the Equations:** We know:
    * a₄ = 24 
    * a₁₁ = 3072

   Let's plug these values into the formula:
    * 24 = a₁ * r^(4-1)  
    * 3072 = a₁ * r^(11-1)

* **Solving for r:**  We can divide the second equation by the first equation to eliminate a₁:
    * (3072 / 24) = (a₁ * r^10) / (a₁ * r^3)
    * 128 = r^7

* **Finding the Root:** Take the seventh root of both sides to find r:
    * r = ∛128 
    * r = 2



\begin{equation*}
r = 2

"Since the graph has a horizontal asymptote at $y=0$, the degree of $p(x)$ must be less than the degree of $q(x)$.  Since $q(x)$ is quadratic, the degree of $p(x)$ must be 1 or less.

We know $p(2) = 2$.  Since the degree of $p(x)$ is 1 or less, we can write $p(x) = ax + b$ for some constants $a$ and $b$.  Then $p(2) = 2a + b = 2$.

We also know $q(-1) = 18$.  Since the degree of $q(x)$ is 2, we can write $q(x) = cx^2 + dx + e$ for some constants $c$, $d$, and $e$.  Then $q(-1) = c - d + e = 18$.

We don't have enough information to find the exact values of $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, and $e$, so we can't find a specific expression for $p(x) + q(x)$.  However, we can write:

\[\boxed{p(x) + q(x) = ax + b + cx^2 + dx + e}\]

For a quartic equation (like ours), one of the formulas says that the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time is equal to the coefficient of the $x^3$ term.

* **Apply Vieta's formula:** In our equation, the coefficient of the $x^3$ term is 2. So,  
   
   $\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2$

Notice that if we rearrange the equation above, we can get each of these sums.  Since we know the sum of all the products is 2, each individual product must be -2.

"Let $z = a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers. Then $\bar{z} = a - bi$. Substituting these into the equation, we get:

$$3(a + bi) + 4i(a - bi) = 1 - 8i$$

Expanding and simplifying:

$$3a + 3bi + 4ai - 4b i^2 = 1 - 8i$$

Since $i^2 = -1$, we have:

$$3a + 3bi + 4ai + 4b = 1 - 8i$$

Grouping real and imaginary terms:

$$(3a + 4b) + (3b + 4a)i = 1 - 8i$$

For the equation to hold, the real and imaginary parts must be equal on both sides. This gives us two equations:

$$3a + 4b = 1$$ $$3b + 4a = -8$$

Solving this system of equations (you can use substitution or elimination), we find $a = -3$ and $b = 2$.

"I don't know much 'bout math, but I can tell ya this:

The biggest number you can get from somethin' like this is when the top part is the biggest and the bottom part is the smallest.

The top part, $x-y$, can be any number.  

The bottom part, $x^4 + y^4 + 6$, is always gonna be at least 6 'cause the $x^4$ and $y^4$ parts are always bigger than zero.

So, the biggest you can get is when the top is really big and the bottom is 6.  

But there ain't no limit to how big the top can be!

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Pure Imaginary:** A complex number is pure imaginary if it has no real part.  It looks like  *bi* where *b* is a real number and *i* is the imaginary unit (√-1).
* **Real Number:** A real number has no imaginary part. It looks like *a* where *a* is a real number.
* **Magnitude (|z|):** The magnitude of a complex number *z = a + bi* is √(a² + b²).

**Solving the Problem**

1. **Let's represent the complex numbers:**
   *  Let  *z₁ = a₁ + b₁i*
   *  Let  *z₂ = a₂ + b₂i*

2. **Use the given information:**
   *  *z₁z₂* is pure imaginary: (a₁ + b₁i)(a₂ + b₂i) = (a₁a₂ - b₁b₂) + (a₁b₂ + a₂b₁)i  must have no real part. This means *a₁a₂ - b₁b₂ = 0*.
   *  *z₁/z₂* is real: (a₁ + b₁i) / (a₂ + b₂i) must have no imaginary part. To get rid of the imaginary part in the denominator, we multiply both numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:
      [(a₁ + b₁i) * (a₂ - b₂i)] / [(a₂ + b₂i) * (a₂ - b₂i)] = (a₁a₂ + b₁b₂) / (a₂² + b₂²)  must be real. This means *a₁a₂ + b₁b₂* must be real.
   *  *|z₁| = |z₂| = 1*: √(a₁² + b₁²) = √(a₂² + b₂²) = 1. This means *a₁² + b₁² = a₂² + b₂² = 1*.

3. **Solve the system of equations:** We have four equations and four unknowns (*a₁*, *b₁*, *a₂*, *b₂*).  You can use these equations to solve for the possible values of *a₁*, *b₁*, *a₂*, and *b₂*.

**Finding the Pairs**

Once you have the possible values for *a₁*, *b₁*, *a₂*, and *b₂*, you can form the pairs (z₁, z₂) and count them.

"Let the roots be $r$, $s$, and $t$. We know $rs = 30$.  Also, the sum of the roots is $10$ and the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time is $55$.  So, \[r + s + t = 10\]and \[rs + rt + st = 55.\]We can write $t = 10 - r - s$. Substituting into the second equation, we get \[rs + r(10 - r - s) + s(10 - r - s) = 55.\]Simplifying, we get \[rs + 10r + 10s - r^2 - rs - s^2 = 55.\]This simplifies to $r^2 + s^2 - 10r - 10s + 55 = 0$.  We can rewrite this as \[(r^2 - 10r + 25) + (s^2 - 10s + 25) = 0.\]This factors as $(r - 5)^2 + (s - 5)^2 = 0$.  Since the squares of real numbers are nonnegative, this means $r - 5 = 0$ and $s - 5 = 0$, so $r = s = 5$.  Then $t = 10 - r - s = 0$, and $c = rst = \boxed{0}$.

"Let's think about this problem.

We know that $f(f(x)) = 6x - 2005$.  That means if we put something into the function, then put the result back into the function, we get $6x - 2005$.

We also know that there's a number, let's call it $n$, that when we put it into the function, we get $6n - 2005$.

So, if we put $n$ into the function, we get $6n - 2005$.  And if we put that result back into the function, we should get $6x - 2005$ again.

Let's try it out:

$f(n) = 6n - 2005$

$f(6n - 2005) = 6x - 2005$

Since $f(n) = 6n - 2005$, we can substitute that in:

$f(f(n)) = 6x - 2005$

But we know that $f(f(x)) = 6x - 2005$ for all $x$.  So, this means:

$6n - 2005 = 6x - 2005$

This means $6n = 6x$.  So, $n = x$.

Since $n$ is an integer, and $x$ can be any real number, there isn't just one answer for $n$.  There are infinitely many integers that work!

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Understanding the Setup:**

We have a circle and an ellipse sharing the same center. The circle goes through both foci of the ellipse.  This means the circle's diameter is equal to the distance between the foci.

* **Using the Area:**

The area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height.  We know the area of triangle $PF_1F_2$ is 26.  We also know that $F_1$ and $F_2$ are the foci of the ellipse, so the base of the triangle is the distance between them (which is what we want to find).  We need to figure out the height.

* **The Height:**

The height of the triangle is the perpendicular distance from point $P$ to the line segment $F_1F_2$.  Since the circle passes through $P$, the line segment $PF_1$ is a radius of the circle.

* **Putting it Together:**

Let's call the distance between the foci  'd'.  We have:

(1/2) * d * height = 26

We need to find the height.  Think about the circle and the ellipse.  The height is related to the radius of the circle and the shape of the ellipse.

* **The Missing Piece:**

Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to directly find the height. We know the major axis of the ellipse is 15, but that doesn't give us enough to determine the height of the triangle.

The smallest number we can add to make a whole number bigger is 1.  So, we need to find the smallest number that, when we add 1 to it and cube it, gives us a whole number.

*  $x - 3 < -2$ which means $x < 1$

**Step 3: Combine the solutions**

* The first inequality says *x* is between -2 and 2.
* The second inequality says *x* is either greater than 5 OR less than 1.

A polynomial with integer coefficients and integer roots can be factored into linear terms.  Each root gives us one of these factors.

We want the most roots possible, so we want to find the biggest number that divides 42.  The biggest number that divides 42 is 42 itself.  So, we can have 42 roots.

Notice that  
\[(3x + \frac{1}{2x})^3 = 27x^3 + \frac{27}{2x^3} + \frac{9}{4x^2} + \frac{1}{8x^3}\]

That looks kinda close to what we want!  Let's see...

If we cube the original equation, we get:

\[(3x + \frac{1}{2x})^3 = 3^3\]

Expanding that out, we get:

\[27x^3 + \frac{27}{2x^3} + \frac{9}{4x^2} + \frac{1}{8x^3} = 27\]

Now, let's rearrange that to get what we want:

\[27x^3 + \frac{1}{8x^3} + \frac{27}{2x^3} + \frac{9}{4x^2} = 27\]

\[64x^6 + \frac{1}{729x^6} = \boxed{27}\]

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Understanding the Problem:**

We have a parabola that crosses the x-axis at points  (p, 0) and (q, 0).  A circle also passes through these two points. We need to find the square of the length of the tangent line from the origin (0, 0) to this circle.

* **Using the Parabola:**

Since the parabola crosses the x-axis at (p, 0) and (q, 0), we know that:

*  *a*p² + *b*p + *c* = 0
*  *a*q² + *b*q + *c* = 0

* **The Circle:**

We don't know the center of the circle, but we know it passes through (p, 0) and (q, 0).  This means the distance from the center of the circle to each of these points is the same (the radius of the circle).

* **Tangent Line:**

The tangent line from the origin to the circle is perpendicular to the radius of the circle at the point of tangency.

* **Putting it Together:**

Unfortunately, without more information about the circle (like its center), it's hard to directly express *t*² in terms of *a*, *b*, and *c*.  We'd need more equations relating the circle's properties to the parabola's coefficients.

"Here's how I'd figure this out:

   The first equation says that  'x' is equal to 'y' squared minus 6 times 'y' plus 5.  

   The second equation says that 'y' is the absolute value of 'x'. That means 'y' is always positive, no matter what 'x' is.

* **Think about the possibilities:**

   Since 'y' is always positive, let's think about what happens when we plug in different values for 'x' into the first equation.  

* **Try some values:**

   If 'x' is really small, 'y' will be small too, because the absolute value of a small number is still small.  If 'x' gets bigger, 'y' will get bigger too.

* **Keep going:**

   We need to find all the possible values of 'x' that make sense.  

This problem is a bit tricky, and it might take some time to figure out all the possibilities.  I'm not sure I can do it without drawing a picture or using a calculator.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

We know:

*  $a + b = 5$ 
*  $a^2 + b^2 = 15$

We want to find $a^3 + b^3$.  

Let's try to use what we know to get to that.  Notice that:

$(a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3$

We can rearrange this a bit:

$a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3 - 3a^2b - 3ab^2$

Now we can use the information we were given:

*  $(a + b)^3 = 5^3 = 125$

We still need to figure out $a^2b + ab^2$.  We can do this by squaring the first equation:

$(a + b)^2 = 5^2$
$a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 25$

We know $a^2 + b^2 = 15$, so:

$2ab = 10$
$ab = 5$

Now we can plug everything back into our equation for $a^3 + b^3$:

$a^3 + b^3 = 125 - 3(5) - 3(5)$
$a^3 + b^3 = 125 - 15 - 15$
$a^3 + b^3 = 95$

"Here's how to solve the problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We know the roots of the first polynomial,  *f(x)*. We also know the roots of the second polynomial, *g(x)*, are the squares of the roots of *f(x)*.  We're given that *g(-1) = -5* and we need to find the biggest possible value for *b* in the first polynomial.

**Using Vieta's Formulas**

Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients of a polynomial to the sum and product of its roots.  Here's how we can use them:

* **For f(x):**
    *  r + s + t = -a 
    *  rs + rt + st = b
    *  rst = 1

* **For g(x):**
    * r² + s² + t² = -m
    * r²s² + r²t² + s²t² = n
    * r²s²t² = p

**Connecting the Polynomials**

Notice that:

*  (r + s + t)² = r² + s² + t² + 2(rs + rt + st)

We can use this to relate the coefficients of *f(x)* and *g(x)*.

**Solving for b**

1. **Find r² + s² + t²:**  We know (r + s + t)² = -a²  and rs + rt + st = b.  Substitute these into the equation above to solve for r² + s² + t² = -m.

2. **Substitute:**  Use the relationships between the coefficients of *f(x)* and *g(x)* to express *n* and *p* in terms of *a* and *b*.

3. **Use g(-1) = -5:** Substitute *x = -1* into the expression for *g(x)* and use the values you found for *m*, *n*, and *p* to solve for *a*.

4. **Maximize b:**  Once you have *a*, substitute it back into the equation rs + rt + st = b to find the greatest possible value for *b*.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Factoring:** Since we know the roots, we can factor the polynomial.  Remember that if  'r' is a root of the polynomial, then (x - r) is a factor. So we have:

  f(x) = (x - 2)(x + 3)(x - 5)(x - r)

* **Expanding:**  We need to expand this out to get back to the form  x⁴ + ax² + bx + c. This will be a bit messy, but it's just multiplication.

* **Matching Coefficients:** Once we have the expanded form, we can compare the coefficients of each power of x to the original polynomial. This will give us equations we can solve for a, b, and c.

* **Finding 'r':** We're missing one root.  We know the sum of the roots of a polynomial is related to its coefficients.  Let's use that to find 'r'.

"Let's think about this.  If the polynomials have a root in common, that means the same number makes both equations true.  

Let's say that number is $r$.  We can plug it into both equations:

*  $r^2 - 7r + b = 0$
*  $r^2 + 2r - 2b = 0$

Now we have two equations and two unknowns ($r$ and $b$).  We can solve for them!  

Let's subtract the second equation from the first:

* $(r^2 - 7r + b) - (r^2 + 2r - 2b) = 0$

This simplifies to:

* $-9r + 3b = 0$

We can solve for $b$:

* $3b = 9r$
* $b = 3r$

Now we can plug this value of $b$ back into either of the original equations. Let's use the first one:

* $r^2 - 7r + 3r = 0$

This simplifies to:

* $r^2 - 4r = 0$

We can factor this:

* $r(r - 4) = 0$

This gives us two possible solutions for $r$:

* $r = 0$
* $r = 4$

So the possible values for the root are $\boxed{0, 4}$.

"Let's break this down.  We got a big ol' square root here.  Let's call the whole thing $y$.

So, $y = \sqrt{\cfrac{x}{1 + \sqrt{\cfrac{x}{1 + \sqrt{\cfrac{x}{1 + \cdots}}}}}} = 8$.

That means $y^2 = \cfrac{x}{1 + \sqrt{\cfrac{x}{1 + \sqrt{\cfrac{x}{1 + \cdots}}}}}$.

See, the square root part is the same as what we started with!  Let's call that whole thing $y$ again.

So, $y^2 = \cfrac{x}{1 + y}$.

Now we can solve for $x$.  Multiply both sides by $1 + y$:

$y^2 (1 + y) = x$

Since we know $y = 8$, we can plug that in:

$8^2 (1 + 8) = x$

$64 \cdot 9 = x$

$\boxed{\frac{5}{2}}$
"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Step 1:  Solve the first equation**

We can use a little trick here.  Notice that both terms in the first equation have $(x-2)$ in them.  Let's substitute  $y = x-2$.  This makes the equation:

 $$y^4 - y = 0$$

Now we can factor out a $y$:

$$y(y^3 - 1) = 0$$

This gives us two possibilities:

*  $y = 0$ 
*  $y^3 - 1 = 0$

Solving the second possibility, we get $y = 1$.

**Step 2: Substitute back to find x**

Remember that we let $y = x-2$.  So:

* If $y=0$, then $x-2 = 0$, and $x=2$.
* If $y=1$, then $x-2 = 1$, and $x=3$.

**Step 3: Use the second equation**

The second equation is $x^2 - kx + k = 0$.  We know this equation has two roots, and we know two of the roots are $x=2$ and $x=3$.  

Since the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is $-b/a$, the sum of the roots of this equation is $k$.  Therefore:

$$k = 2 + 3 = 5$$

"\begin{equation*}
a + b + c + d = \frac{-b}{a}
\end{equation*}"
"\begin{equation*}
d
\end{equation*}

Let's plug in what we know:

*  $1 \star 2 = 3$  means  $a(1) + b(2) + c(1)(2) = 3$
*  $2 \star 3 = 4$  means  $a(2) + b(3) + c(2)(3) = 4$
*  $x \star d = x$ means $a(x) + b(d) + c(x)(d) = x$

We need to figure out what $d$ is.  The last equation is important because it tells us something about $d$ no matter what $x$ is. 

Let's look at the last equation again: $a(x) + b(d) + c(x)(d) = x$.  

For this to be true for *any* $x$, the $x$ terms on both sides must match. This means:

* $a = 1$ 

Now we can plug that back into the first two equations and solve for $b$ and $c$.  But we don't actually need to do that!  We already know $d$ must be a number that makes the equation $a(x) + b(d) + c(x)(d) = x$ work for all $x$.  

Since $a = 1$, the equation becomes:

$x + b(d) + c(x)(d) = x$

For this to be true, $b(d)$ must be 0.  That means $d$ must be 0.

Here's why:

If a quadratic has real coefficients, then the non-real roots must come in conjugate pairs.  Since $5-4i$ is a root, its conjugate, $5+4i$, must also be a root.

We can use the sum and product of roots to find the quadratic.

* **Sum of roots:** $(5-4i) + (5+4i) = 10$
* **Product of roots:** $(5-4i)(5+4i) = 25 + 16 = 41$

So, the quadratic is of the form:

$x^2 - (\text{sum of roots})x + (\text{product of roots}) = x^2 - 10x + 41$

*  Same goes for $3+\sqrt{7}$ and its opposite, $3-\sqrt{7}$.

That's four roots right there!  Since we have four roots total, the smallest the polynomial can be is degree 4.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Find z²:**

   (9 + bi)³ = 729 + 243bi + 81b²i + 9b³i³ = 729 + 243bi + 81b²i - 9b³

* **Set the imaginary parts equal:**
   The imaginary part of z² is 18b, and the imaginary part of z³ is 243b + 81b² 
   So, 18b = 243b + 81b²

* **Solve for b:**
   81b² + 225b = 0
   9b(9b + 25) = 0

1. **Simplify the equation:** 
   Subtract 10 from both sides to get:
   \[x^5 + 5x^4 + 10x^3 + 10x^2 - 5x - 9 = 0\]

2. **Notice something special:**
   We want to find $(x+1)^4$.  Let's see if we can use the equation to help us.

3. **Try substituting:**
   If we let $x = -1$, the equation becomes:
   \[(-1)^5 + 5(-1)^4 + 10(-1)^3 + 10(-1)^2 - 5(-1) - 9 = 0\]
   This simplifies to:
   \[-1 + 5 - 10 + 10 + 5 - 9 = 0\]
   Which is true!

4. **Use the Factor Theorem:**
   Since the equation equals zero when $x = -1$, we know that $(x + 1)$ is a factor of the polynomial.

5. **Polynomial Division (optional):**
   You could use polynomial long division to divide the polynomial by $(x+1)$ to find the other factors.  However, we don't actually need to do this to solve the problem.

6. **Focus on the answer:**
   We know $(x+1)$ is a factor, so:
   \[x^5 + 5x^4 + 10x^3 + 10x^2 - 5x - 9 = (x+1)(something else)\]
   Since we want to find $(x+1)^4$, we can just square the factor $(x+1)$:
   \[(x+1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1\]
   And then square it again:
   \[(x+1)^4 = (x^2 + 2x + 1)^2 = x^4 + 4x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x + 1\]



$\boxed{(x+1)^4 = x^4 + 4x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x + 1}$

"This problem looks kinda tricky, but I think I can figure it out!

We can use something called ""factoring"" to simplify the fraction.  It's like finding the pieces that make up the whole thing.

The top part, $8x^3 + 27y^3$, looks like it might be the sum of cubes.  Remember, the sum of cubes is like $(a+b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)$.

So,  $8x^3 + 27y^3$ is like $(2x + 3y)(4x^2 - 6xy + 9y^2)$.

Now we can simplify the whole fraction:

$$\frac{8x^3 + 27y^3}{2x + 3y} = \frac{(2x + 3y)(4x^2 - 6xy + 9y^2)}{2x + 3y}$$

The $(2x+3y)$ parts cancel out, leaving us with:

$$4x^2 - 6xy + 9y^2$$

So, $a = 4$, $b = -6$, and $c = 9$.

Finally, $a + b + c = 4 - 6 + 9 = \boxed{7}$.

$$z^3 - z^2 + z = 0.$$

Then $z^3 = z^2 - z$.  We can substitute $z^2 - z + 1 = 0$ to get

"Here's how to solve this problem:

1. **Find a common denominator on the right side:**

   The right side of the equation has denominators *r* and *s*.  A common denominator is *rs*.

   \[\frac{1}{r + s} = \frac{s}{rs} + \frac{r}{rs}\]

2. **Combine the fractions on the right side:**

   \[\frac{1}{r + s} = \frac{s + r}{rs}\]

3. **Take the reciprocal of both sides:**

   \[r + s = \frac{rs}{s + r}\]

4. **Multiply both sides by (r + s):**

   \[(r + s)^2 = rs\]

5. **Expand the left side:**

   \[r^2 + 2rs + s^2 = rs\]

6. **Move all terms to one side:**

   \[r^2 + rs + s^2 = 0\]

7. **Now we want to find (r/s)^3:**

   \[\left( \frac{r}{s} \right)^3 = \frac{r^3}{s^3}\]

   We don't have a direct way to find  *r* and *s* individually, but we can try to manipulate the equation we have to see if we can express *r³/s³* in terms of something we know.

   Unfortunately, it doesn't look like we can easily do that.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Understanding the Problem:**

We're given a quadratic equation and told one of its roots is purely imaginary.  We need to find the sum of a complex number and its complex conjugate.

* **Key Ideas:**

* **Purely Imaginary:** A purely imaginary number has no real part, meaning it's of the form  *bi* where *b* is a real number and *i* is the imaginary unit (√-1).
* **Complex Conjugate:** The complex conjugate of a number *a + bi* is *a - bi*. The sum of a complex number and its conjugate is always real.

* **Solution:**

Let the pure imaginary root be *bi*. Since the equation has two roots, the other root must be its conjugate, *-bi*.

We can use the relationship between the roots and coefficients of a quadratic equation:

* **Sum of roots:**  *z₁ + z₂ = -b/a*
* **Product of roots:** *z₁z₂ = c/a*

In our case, *a = 1*, *b = 1*, and *c = ω*.  Therefore:

* *bi - bi = -1/1*  which means *0 = -1* (This is not possible)

This tells us there's an error in the problem statement. It's impossible for a quadratic equation of this form to have a pure imaginary root.

We can solve this like a regular equation:

$(f(1) - 2)(f(1) + 1) = 0$

    *  $16 + 8b + 4c + 2d + e = 0$
    *  $81 + 27b + 9c + 3d + e = 0$

* We have a lot of unknowns, but we can use these equations to solve for them.  It's a bit messy, but that's how we'd find the values of  $b$, $c$, $d$, and $e$.

* Once we know those, we can find $p(0)$ and $p(4)$ by plugging in those values for $x$.

* **Vertical asymptote at x=-1:** This means the bottom of the fraction has a factor of (x+1) but the top doesn't.
* **No horizontal asymptote:** This means the degree of the top is bigger than the degree of the bottom.
* **q(1) = -6:** This gives us a specific point on the graph of q(x).

Putting it all together,  I'd guess  $q(x)$ looks something like this:

 $$q(x) = (x+1)(ax+b)$$

We know (x-2) is a factor of the top, and we need the degree of the top to be bigger than the degree of the bottom.  We also know q(1) = -6.  We can use that to figure out 'a' and 'b'.

* Now we have the new function $y = f(2x + 1) + 3$.  Let's try to figure out what happens to our original point  $(-2, 3)$ when we plug it into this new function.

*  Let's substitute $x = -2$ into the new function:
   *  $y = f(2(-2) + 1) + 3$
   *  $y = f(-4 + 1) + 3$
   *  $y = f(-3) + 3$

*  Since we know  $(-2, 3)$ was on the original graph, and $f(-2) = 3$, we can say that $c = 3$.

*  Finally, we have $\log_{2} 256$. This is the same as asking ""to what power do we need to raise 2 to get 256?"". We already know this is 8.

Since the polynomial has rational coefficients, it must have all its roots in pairs.  That means it has to have roots like:

Now, let's see where those points take us when we plug them back into $f(x)$:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're given a cubic equation and told that *r*, *s*, and *t* are the solutions (roots) to that equation. We also have a function *f(x)*.  We need to find the sum of *f(r)*, *f(s)*, and *f(t)*.

**Using Vieta's Formulas**

There's a handy tool called Vieta's formulas that helps us work with the roots of polynomial equations.  One of Vieta's formulas tells us:

*  The sum of the roots of a cubic equation of the form  *ax³ + bx² + cx + d = 0* is  *-b/a*.

**Applying Vieta's Formulas**

1. **Find the sum of the roots:** In our equation, *4x³ - 59x² + 32x - 32 = 0*, the coefficient of the *x²* term is *-59*.  So, *r + s + t = 59/4*.

2. **Relate the sum to the function:**  Let's look at the function *f(x) = 4x³ - 59x²*.  Notice that if we plug in *r + s + t* into *f(x)*, we get:

   *f(r + s + t) = 4(r + s + t)³ - 59(r + s + t)²*

3. **Substitute and simplify:** We know *r + s + t = 59/4*. Substitute this into the expression above and simplify. This will give you the value of *f(r) + f(s) + f(t)*.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

1. **Simplify the equation:**

   We can rewrite the equation as:

   $$x^{\log_{1995}x} = \frac{x^2}{\sqrt{1995}}$$

2. **Take the logarithm of both sides:**

   Let's use the logarithm base 1995:

   $$\log_{1995}(x^{\log_{1995}x}) = \log_{1995}\left(\frac{x^2}{\sqrt{1995}}\right)$$

3. **Use logarithm properties:**

   *  $\log_a (b^c) = c \cdot \log_a b$

   Applying this to the left side:

   $$\log_{1995}x \cdot \log_{1995}x = \log_{1995}\left(\frac{x^2}{\sqrt{1995}}\right)$$

   * $\log_a \frac{b}{c} = \log_a b - \log_a c$

   Applying this to the right side:

   $$\log_{1995}x \cdot \log_{1995}x = 2\log_{1995}x - \log_{1995}\sqrt{1995}$$

4. **Simplify and solve for  $\log_{1995}x$:**

   $$\log_{1995}x \cdot \log_{1995}x - 2\log_{1995}x + \log_{1995}\sqrt{1995} = 0$$

   This is a quadratic equation in terms of $\log_{1995}x$. Solve for it (you can use the quadratic formula). You'll get two solutions.

5. **Find the positive roots:**

   Remember that we're looking for the positive roots of the original equation.  Since the logarithm is only defined for positive values, the positive solution for $\log_{1995}x$ will give you the positive root of the original equation.

6. **Calculate the product:**

   Multiply the two positive roots you found.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Understanding the Shift:** When a line is shifted left, the 'x' values change.  Shifting down changes the 'y' values.

* **Using the Points:** We know line $l_1$ goes through (5, 8) and (7, 14).  This means we can find the slope of $l_1$.

* **Slope Formula:** The slope of a line is  `(change in y) / (change in x)`.  Using our points:

   Slope of $l_1$ = (14 - 8) / (7 - 5) = 6 / 2 = 3

* **Equation of  $l_1$:** We know the slope of $l_1$ is 3 and it passes through (5, 8). We can use the point-slope form of a line:

   y - y1 = m(x - x1)
   y - 8 = 3(x - 5)

* **Simplifying:**  Let's turn this into slope-intercept form (y = mx + b):
   y - 8 = 3x - 15
   y = 3x - 7

* **Comparing to  $l$:**  Line $l$ is  y = ax + b.  We know $l_1$ is y = 3x - 7.  This means a = 3 and b = -7.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Understanding Geometric Sequences:**  A geometric sequence is a list of numbers where each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant value called the common ratio.

* **Using the Formulas:**  We know:
    *  $a_1 = 27$ (the first term of sequence *a*)
    *  $b_1 = 99$ (the first term of sequence *b*)
    *  $a_{15} = b_{11}$ (the 15th term of *a* is equal to the 11th term of *b*)

The formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is: $a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1}$ where *r* is the common ratio.

* **Setting up the Equation:** Since the common ratio is the same for both sequences, we can set up an equation:

   $a_{15} = b_{11}$ 
   $27 \cdot r^{14} = 99 \cdot r^{10}$

* **Solving for r:** Divide both sides by $27 \cdot r^{10}$:
   $r^4 = \frac{99}{27} = \frac{11}{3}$

* **Finding a_9:** Now that we know the common ratio, we can find $a_9$:
   $a_9 = 27 \cdot r^{8} = 27 \cdot \left(\frac{11}{3}\right)^2 = 27 \cdot \frac{121}{9} = \boxed{363}$ 



"
"Here's how to solve the problem:

1. **Square both sides:** To get rid of the square roots, we square both sides of the equation: 
   \[(\sqrt{5 | x | + 8})^2 = (\sqrt{x^2 - 16})^2\]
   This simplifies to:
   \[5 | x | + 8 = x^2 - 16\]

2. **Move everything to one side:**  Let's rearrange the equation to get a quadratic:
   \[x^2 - 5 | x | - 24 = 0\]

3. **Consider both positive and negative x:** Since we have an absolute value, we need to consider two cases:

   * **Case 1: x ≥ 0** 
      The equation becomes:
      \[x^2 - 5x - 24 = 0\]
      We can factor this:
      \[(x-8)(x+3) = 0\]
      This gives us solutions  x = 8 and x = -3.  Since we're in the case where x ≥ 0, we only keep x = 8.

   * **Case 2: x < 0**
      The equation becomes:
      \[x^2 + 5x - 24 = 0\]
      We can factor this:
      \[(x+8)(x-3) = 0\]
      This gives us solutions x = -8 and x = 3. Since we're in the case where x < 0, we only keep x = -8.

4. **Product of roots:** The roots of the equation are x = 8 and x = -8.  Their product is:

We want to find the smallest *n* that makes 2002 divided by *n* *not* a whole number.  That means *n* has to be bigger than 2002 divided by some whole number.

Here's my thinking:

If $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are factors of $P(x)$, that means when you divide $P(x)$ by $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, you get no leftovers.  

Since $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are both quadratic (highest power of $x$ is 2), and $P(x)$ is cubic (highest power of $x$ is 3),  $P(x)$ must have at least one more term than $Q_1$ and $Q_2$.  

To make this work, the 'extra' term in $P(x)$ has to be able to be divided evenly by both $Q_1$ and $Q_2$.  That means the 'extra' term has to be a multiple of both $Q_1$ and $Q_2$.

The only way for that to happen is if the 'extra' term is zero.  That means the highest power of $x$ in $P(x)$ has to be 2.  

So, $P(x)$ has to look something like this:

$$P(x) = a(x^2 + (k-29)x - k)$$

where $a$ is some number.

Now, if we want $Q_2$ to also be a factor, the expression inside the parentheses has to be a factor of $Q_2$.  That means:

$$x^2 + (k-29)x - k = \text{some multiple of } (2x^2 + (2k-43)x + k)$$

I'm not sure how to solve this exactly, but I know that if $k=29$, then the expressions are the same.  So, $k=29$ is a good guess!

\end{align*}From the first equation, $r + s + t = 2rst$.  Squaring both sides, we get
\[(r + s + t)^2 = 4r^2 s^2 t^2.\]Expanding the left side, we get
\[r^2 + s^2 + t^2 + 2rs + 2rt + 2st = 4r^2 s^2 t^2.\]Substituting $r^2 + s^2 + t^2 = 3rst$, we get
\[3rst + 2rs + 2rt + 2st = 4r^2 s^2 t^2.\]Then $2rs + 2rt + 2st = 4r^2 s^2 t^2 - 3rst$.  We can write

2rs + 2rt + 2st &= 2r(s + t) + 2st \\

\[2st(2r^2 + 1) = 4r^2 s^2 t^2 - 3rst + 2r^2.\]Since $r$, $s$, and $t$ are roots of the polynomial, $r^2 + s^2 + t^2 = 3rst$ implies $r^2 + s^2 + t^2 - 3rst = 0$.  Then
\[(r - s)^2 + (s - t)^2 + (t - r)^2 = 0.\]This forces $r = s = t$, which contradicts the fact that the roots are distinct.  Therefore, there is no such polynomial.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Understanding the Problem:**

We're given two quadratic equations,  *f(x)* and *g(x)*.  We know the roots of *f(x)* are *r* and *s*, and the roots of *g(x)* are *-r* and *-s*. We want to find the roots of the equation when we add *f(x)* and *g(x)* together.

* **Using the Roots:**

Remember that if *a* is a root of a quadratic equation, then (x - *a*) is a factor of that equation.  

* Since *r* and *s* are roots of *f(x)*, we know:
   *f(x) = (x - r)(x - s)*

* Since *-r* and *-s* are roots of *g(x)*, we know:
   *g(x) = (x + r)(x + s)*

* **Expanding and Adding:**

Let's expand these equations:

* *f(x) = x² - rx - sx + rs = x² - (r + s)x + rs*
* *g(x) = x² + rx + sx + rs = x² + (r + s)x + rs*

Now, add *f(x)* and *g(x)*:

* *f(x) + g(x) = (x² - (r + s)x + rs) + (x² + (r + s)x + rs)*
* *f(x) + g(x) = 2x² + 2rs*

* **Finding the Roots:**

We want to find the roots of *2x² + 2rs = 0*.  Let's solve for *x*:

* *2x² = -2rs*
* *x² = -rs*
* *x = ±√(-rs)*

Since *rs* is a positive number (because the roots of *f(x)* are real), the square root of a negative number is imaginary.

We want to find the numbers less than 1000 where the $\log_2$ is a little bigger than an even number.  That means we're looking for numbers that are a little bigger than the powers of 2.

So, Patrick has $2x$ pieces of candy in the end.

Now let's look at the statements:

* **(a) 2 can be a divisor of P:**  Since Patrick has $2x$,  2 will always be a divisor of $P$.
* **(b) 2 must be a divisor of P:**  This is true because $P$ is always $2x$.
* **(c) 3 can be a divisor of P:**  This depends on if $x$ is divisible by 3.
* **(d) 3 must be a divisor of P:** This is not always true.
* **(e) 4 can be a divisor of P:** This depends on if $x$ is divisible by 2.
* **(f) 4 must be a divisor of P:** This is true because $P$ is always $2x$.

"Let's break this down.

* **Base 3:**  Think of it like counting with only the numbers 0, 1, and 2. Each place value is a power of 3 (like 3 to the 0, 3 to the 1, 3 to the 2, and so on).

* **Base 6:**  Same idea, but we use 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Each place value is a power of 6.

* **Four digits in base 3:** This means the number is something like  _ _ _ _.  The smallest would be 1000 (base 3) and the biggest would be 2222 (base 3).

* **Two digits in base 6:** This means the number is something like _ _.

Now, we gotta figure out which numbers in base 3 turn into two-digit numbers in base 6. That's tricky, and I'm not sure how to do that without more help.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Think about remainders:** When we divide a number by 13, the remainder is what's left over.

* **Look for patterns:** Let's see what happens when we raise numbers to powers and look at the remainders when divided by 13:

    *  $24 \div 13 = 1 \text{ remainder } 11$  
    *  $24^2 \div 13 = 121 \div 13 = 9 \text{ remainder } 4$
    *  $24^3 \div 13 = 24 \cdot 4 \div 13 = 96 \div 13 = 7 \text{ remainder } 5$
    *  $24^4 \div 13 = 24 \cdot 5 \div 13 = 120 \div 13 = 9 \text{ remainder } 3$
    *  $24^5 \div 13 = 24 \cdot 3 \div 13 = 72 \div 13 = 5 \text{ remainder } 7$
    *  $24^6 \div 13 = 24 \cdot 7 \div 13 = 168 \div 13 = 12 \text{ remainder } 12$
    *  $24^7 \div 13 = 24 \cdot 12 \div 13 = 288 \div 13 = 22 \text{ remainder } 2$
    *  $24^8 \div 13 = 24 \cdot 2 \div 13 = 48 \div 13 = 3 \text{ remainder } 9$
    *  $24^9 \div 13 = 24 \cdot 9 \div 13 = 216 \div 13 = 16 \text{ remainder } 8$
    *  $24^{10} \div 13 = 24 \cdot 8 \div 13 = 192 \div 13 = 14 \text{ remainder } 10$
    *  $24^{11} \div 13 = 24 \cdot 10 \div 13 = 240 \div 13 = 18 \text{ remainder } 6$
    *  $24^{12} \div 13 = 24 \cdot 6 \div 13 = 144 \div 13 = 11 \text{ remainder } 1$

* **Notice the cycle:** The remainders start repeating after this point.  The pattern of remainders when $24^n$ is divided by 13 is: 11, 4, 5, 3, 7, 12, 2, 9, 8, 10, 6, 1, and then it repeats.

* **Find the right spot:** Since the pattern repeats every 12 powers, we need to figure out where 50 falls in this pattern.  Divide 50 by 12: $50 \div 12 = 4 \text{ remainder } 2$. This means $24^{50}$ will have the same remainder as $24^2$ when divided by 13, which is 4.

* **Do the same for 15:**

    * $15 \div 13 = 1 \text{ remainder } 2$
    * $15^2 \div 13 = 225 \div 13 = 17 \text{ remainder } 4$
    * $15^3 \div 13 = 15 \cdot 4 \div 13 = 60 \div 13 = 4 \text{ remainder } 8$
    * $15^4 \div 13 = 15 \cdot 8 \div 13 = 120 \div 13 = 9 \text{ remainder } 3$
    * $15^5 \div 13 = 15 \cdot 3 \div 13 = 45 \div 13 = 3 \text{ remainder } 6$
    * $15^6 \div 13 = 15 \cdot 6 \div 13 = 90 \div 13 = 6 \text{ remainder } 12$
    * $15^7 \div 13 = 15 \cdot 12 \div 13 = 180 \div 13 = 13 \text{ remainder } 11$
    * $15^8 \div 13 = 15 \cdot 11 \div 13 = 165 \div 13 = 12 \text{ remainder } 9$
    * $15^9 \div 13 = 15 \cdot 9 \div 13 = 135 \div 13 = 10 \text{ remainder } 5$
    * $15^{10} \div 13 = 15 \cdot 5 \div 13 = 75 \div 13 = 5 \text{ remainder } 10$
    * $15^{11} \div 13 = 15 \cdot 10 \div 13 = 150 \div 13 = 11 \text{ remainder } 7$
    * $15^{12} \div 13 = 15 \cdot 7 \div 13 = 105 \div 13 = 8 \text{ remainder } 1$

* **Repeat the process:**  Divide 50 by 12: $50 \div 12 = 4 \text{ remainder } 2$. This means $15^{50}$ will have the same remainder as $15^2$ when divided by 13, which is 4.

* **Find the final answer:**  Since $24^{50}$ has a remainder of 4 and $15^{50}$ has a remainder of 4 when divided by 13, their difference will have a remainder of $4-4 = 0$.



$\boxed{0}$"
"Here's how to do that:

* **Convert to base 10:**

   *  $315_6 = (3 \times 6^2) + (1 \times 6^1) + (5 \times 6^0) = 108 + 6 + 5 = 119$
   *  $4_6 = (4 \times 6^0) = 4$

* **Multiply in base 10:**

   * $119 \times 4 = 476$

* **Convert back to base 6:**

   *  Divide 476 by 6:  $476 \div 6 = 79 \text{ remainder } 2$
   *  Divide 79 by 6:  $79 \div 6 = 13 \text{ remainder } 1$
   *  Divide 13 by 6:  $13 \div 6 = 2 \text{ remainder } 1$
   *  Divide 2 by 6:  $2 \div 6 = 0 \text{ remainder } 2$

   Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get $2112_6$.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Understanding Modulo:**  The symbol ""$\equiv$"" means ""is congruent to"".  When we say $ab \equiv 17 \pmod{20}$, it means that the product of $a$ and $b$ leaves a remainder of 17 when divided by 20.

* **Expanding the Expression:** Let's expand $(a+10)(b+10)$:
   
   $(a+10)(b+10) = ab + 10a + 10b + 100$

* **Focusing on the Remainder:** We only care about the remainder when this expression is divided by 20.  Notice that 100 divided by 20 is 5 with no remainder.  So, we can rewrite our expression:

   $(a+10)(b+10) \equiv ab + 10a + 10b \pmod{20}$

* **Using the Given Information:** We know $ab \equiv 17 \pmod{20}$.  Let's substitute that in:

   $(a+10)(b+10) \equiv 17 + 10a + 10b \pmod{20}$

* **Simplifying:**  We can rewrite this as:

   $(a+10)(b+10) \equiv 17 + 10(a+b) \pmod{20}$

Since we don't know the values of $a$ and $b$, we can't simplify further.

"Here's how to solve this:

* **Divisibility Rule for 18:** A number is divisible by 18 if it's divisible by both 2 and 9.

* **Divisibility Rule for 2:** A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even.

* **Divisibility Rule for 9:** A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.

Let's check the last rule: 3 + 7 + 4 + $n$ = 14 + $n$.  

For this sum to be divisible by 9,  $n$ must be 4. 

And since 4 is even, it also works for the divisibility rule of 2.

* 2 + 2 + 2 = 6
* 2 + 2 + 4 = 8
* 2 + 2 + 8 = 12
* 2 + 4 + 2 = 8
* 2 + 4 + 4 = 10

* **Converting to Base 10:**  Let's break down the number $1d41_8$:

   *  The rightmost digit (1) is in the units place, so it represents $1 \times 8^0 = 1$.
   *  The next digit (4) is in the eights place, so it represents $4 \times 8^1 = 32$.
   *  The digit 'd' is in the sixty-fours place, so it represents $d \times 8^2 = 64d$.
   *  The leftmost digit (1) is in the five hundred twelves place, so it represents $1 \times 8^3 = 512$.

* **Putting it Together:**  The base 10 representation of $1d41_8$ is $512 + 64d + 32 + 1 = 545 + 64d$.

* **Finding all Possible Values:** Since 'd' can be any digit from 0 to 7, we need to find the sum of the following:

   * $545 + 64(0) = 545$
   * $545 + 64(1) = 609$

*  Similarly, $b = 19j + 2$ for some integer $j$, and $c = 19l + 18$ for some integer $l$.

Now let's substitute these values into the expression $2a + b - c$:

 $$2a + b - c = 2(19k + 4) + (19j + 2) - (19l + 18)$$

Simplifying:

$$2a + b - c = 38k + 8 + 19j + 2 - 19l - 18$$

$$2a + b - c = 38k + 19j - 19l - 8$$

$$2a + b - c = 19(2k + j - l) - 8$$

Since $2k + j - l$ is an integer, we see that $2a + b - c$ has a remainder of $\boxed{11}$ when divided by 19.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

1. **Simplify the expression:**

   Start by combining like terms:

   $$a(2a+b)-2a^2 + ab = 2a^2 + ab - 2a^2 + ab = 2ab$$

2. **Prime Numbers:**

   Since $a$ and $b$ are prime numbers, their only divisors are 1 and themselves.

3. **Divisors of 2ab:**

   The divisors of $2ab$ are all the possible combinations of the divisors of 2, $a$, and $b$.  

   * The divisors of 2 are 1 and 2.
   * The divisors of $a$ are 1 and $a$.
   * The divisors of $b$ are 1 and $b$.

   To find all the divisors of $2ab$, we multiply one divisor from each of these sets: 1, 2, $a$, $2a$, $b$, $2b$, $ab$, and $2ab$.

4. **Counting the Divisors:**

   There are $\boxed{8}$ divisors of $2ab$.

"$\boxed{7}$ 

Here's how I figured that out:

*  The units digit of a number times another number is just the units digit of each number times each other.
*  The units digit of $13^{19}$ is the same as the units digit of $3^{19}$.
*  The units digit of $19^{13}$ is the same as the units digit of $9^{13}$.
*  Look for a pattern in the units digits of the powers of 3: 
    * $3^1 = 3$
    * $3^2 = 9$
    * $3^3 = 27$
    * $3^4 = 81$
    * $3^5 = 243$ 
  Notice the units digits cycle through 3, 9, 7, 1.
*  To figure out where $3^{19}$ falls in this cycle, divide 19 by 4 (the length of the cycle) and look at the remainder: 19 divided by 4 is 4 with a remainder of 3.  This means the units digit of $3^{19}$ is the same as the units digit of $3^3$, which is 7.
*  Now look for a pattern in the units digits of the powers of 9:
    * $9^1 = 9$
    * $9^2 = 81$
    * $9^3 = 729$
  The units digits cycle through 9, 1.
*  Since 13 is odd, the units digit of $9^{13}$ is 9.
*  Finally, the units digit of $13^{19} \cdot 19^{13}$ is the same as the units digit of $7 \cdot 9 = 63$, which is $\boxed{3}$.

"Let's break this down.

*  We gotta find the biggest number that all these sums divide into evenly.

*  Factorials get big fast!  Like, 5! is 5*4*3*2*1 = 120.

*  Notice that each sum has a factorial in it.  

*  The biggest factorial in the bunch is 8!.  

*  So, the answer probably has 8! in it.

*  Let's try to see if we can write all the sums as multiples of 8!

Let's see...

* $1! + 2! = 3$
* $2! + 3! = 9$
* $3! + 4! = 33$
* $4! + 5! = 165$
* $5! + 6! = 720$
* $6! + 7! = 5040$
* $7! + 8! = 40320$
* $8! + 9! = 362880$

Hmm...  It looks like we can write all of them as multiples of 8!

* $3 = \frac{3}{8!} \cdot 8!$
* $9 = \frac{9}{8!} \cdot 8!$
* $33 = \frac{33}{8!} \cdot 8!$
* $165 = \frac{165}{8!} \cdot 8!$
* $720 = \frac{720}{8!} \cdot 8!$
* $5040 = \frac{5040}{8!} \cdot 8!$
* $40320 = \frac{40320}{8!} \cdot 8!$
* $362880 = \frac{362880}{8!} \cdot 8!$



So, the least common multiple is $362880$ and $b = 8$.  

$\boxed{a+b = 362880 + 8 = 362888}$

* **Setting up Equations:**

   *  We know $b^2$ in base $c$ is $121_c$.  This means:
      $$b^2 = 1\cdot c^2 + 2\cdot c^1 + 1\cdot c^0 = c^2 + 2c + 1$$

   * We also know $c^2$ in base $b$ is $71_b$. This means:
      $$c^2 = 7\cdot b^1 + 1\cdot b^0 = 7b + 1$$

* **Solving for b and c:** Now we have two equations:

   1.  $b^2 = c^2 + 2c + 1$
   2.  $c^2 = 7b + 1$

   We can solve for $b$ and $c$ using substitution or other algebraic methods. This might take a bit of work, but it's a standard system of equations problem.

* **Find the inverses:**

   *  The inverse of 3 modulo 31 is the number that, when multiplied by 3, gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 31.  We can find this by trial and error.  We see that $3 \cdot 10 = 30$, which has a remainder of -1 when divided by 31.  So, $3 \cdot (-10) = -30$ has a remainder of 1 when divided by 31.  Therefore, the inverse of 3 modulo 31 is -10, which is the same as 21.

   *  Similarly, the inverse of 5 modulo 31 is the number that, when multiplied by 5, gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 31. We find that $5 \cdot 6 = 30$ has a remainder of -1 when divided by 31. So, $5 \cdot (-6) = -30$ has a remainder of 1 when divided by 31. Therefore, the inverse of 5 modulo 31 is -6, which is the same as 25.

* **Substitute and simplify:**

   * Now we have: $(3^{-1} + 5^{-1})^{-1} \equiv (21 + 25)^{-1} \pmod{31}$
   *  This simplifies to $(46)^{-1} \pmod{31}$.
   *  Since 46 is larger than 31, we find its remainder when divided by 31: $46 \equiv 15 \pmod{31}$.
   *  So, we need to find the inverse of 15 modulo 31. We can use the same method as before and find that $15 \cdot 21 = 315$ has a remainder of 1 when divided by 31. Therefore, the inverse of 15 modulo 31 is 21.

$80325$ is a pretty big number.  To figure out what number it divides into, we gotta think about its parts.  

Let's see, $80325$ is divisible by 5, 'cause it ends in a 5.  And it's also divisible by 3, 'cause the sum of its digits (8+0+3+2+5 = 18) is divisible by 3.

So, to make sure $80325$ divides into $n!$, we need $n!$ to have lots of 5s and 3s in it.  

The more numbers we multiply together, the more likely we are to get a 5 or a 3.  

Let's start counting:

* 5, 10, 15, 20...  We get a 5 every 5 numbers.
* 3, 6, 9, 12... We get a 3 every 3 numbers.

So, we need to find the smallest $n$ that has enough 5s and 3s.  

I reckon we need at least a few more than 80325 to be sure.

"Here's how to solve this:

* **Find the numbers that share a factor with 8:**  The numbers 1, 3, 5, and 7 don't share any factors with 8 other than 1.

* **Think about powers of 3:**  
    * $3^1 = 3$
    * $3^2 = 9$
    * $3^3 = 27$
    * $3^4 = 81$

Notice that the remainders when powers of 3 are divided by 8 start repeating (3, 1, 3, 1...).  Since 4 is even, the remainder when $3^4$ is divided by 8 is 1.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Understanding LCM and GCD:**

The least common multiple (LCM) is the smallest number that both numbers divide into evenly. The greatest common divisor (GCD) is the biggest number that divides into both numbers evenly.

* **Key Relationship:**

There's a special rule:  LCM * GCD = product of the two numbers.

* **Using the Information:**

We know the product of the two numbers is 144.  We also know the ratio of LCM to GCD is 9,  meaning LCM = 9 * GCD.

* **Solving for GCD and LCM:**

Let's use the relationship:

* LCM * GCD = 144
* (9 * GCD) * GCD = 144
* 9 * GCD² = 144
* GCD² = 16
* GCD = 4  (We take the positive root since GCD is always positive)

Now, find LCM:

* LCM = 9 * GCD = 9 * 4 = 36

* **Finding the Numbers:**

We need to find two numbers that multiply to 144 and have a GCD of 4.  Since the GCD is 4, both numbers must be divisible by 4.  

Some possibilities are:

* 4 * 36 = 144
* 8 * 18 = 144
* 12 * 12 = 144

* **Calculating the Sum:**

The sum of the two numbers in each possibility is:

This means the last digit of $17^{13}$ is the same as the first number in our pattern, which is 9.

* **Look for patterns:** Let's see what happens when we raise numbers close to multiples of 11 to different powers, and look at the remainders when divided by 11:

    *  $121 \div 11 = 11$ (remainder 0)
    *  $110 \div 11 = 10$ (remainder 0)
    *  $100 \div 11 = 9$ (remainder 1)

* **Apply the pattern:**

    *  $129 \div 11 = 11$ (remainder 8)  So, $129$ is like $110$ plus $8$.
    *  $96 \div 11 = 8$ (remainder 8) So, $96$ is like $88$ plus $8$.

* **Simplify:**

    *  $129^{34}$ is like $(110 + 8)^{34}$.  Since $110$ is a multiple of 11, its powers will always leave a remainder of 0 when divided by 11. So, $129^{34}$ will have the same remainder as $8^{34}$ when divided by 11.
    *  $96^{38}$ is like $(88 + 8)^{38}$.  Similar to above, this will have the same remainder as $8^{38}$ when divided by 11.

* **Find the remainders:** Now we need to figure out the remainders of $8^{34}$ and $8^{38}$ when divided by 11.  We can keep looking for patterns:

    * $8^1 \div 11 = 0$ (remainder 8)
    * $8^2 \div 11 = 0$ (remainder 9)
    * $8^3 \div 11 = 0$ (remainder 4)
    * $8^4 \div 11 = 1$ (remainder 1)

    Notice that the remainders start repeating!  The pattern is 8, 9, 4, 1, and then it goes back to 8, 9, 4, 1...

    *  Since 34 divided by 4 has a remainder of 2,  $8^{34}$ will have the same remainder as $8^2$, which is 9.
    *  Since 38 divided by 4 has a remainder of 2, $8^{38}$ will also have the same remainder as $8^2$, which is 9.



* **Final Calculation:**

    *  $129^{34} + 96^{38}$ has the same remainder as $9 + 9 = 18$ when divided by 11.

   Expanding this out gets a bit messy, but the important thing is we're dealing with powers of 'b'.

* **Step 2: Add 1001_b**

   This is just like adding regular numbers, but again, remember the place values are powers of 'b'.

   So,  (result from Step 1) + 1001_b = (result from Step 1) + (1*b^3 + 0*b^2 + 0*b^1 + 1*b^0)

* **Step 3: Simplify**

   Combine all the terms, remembering to keep the powers of 'b' organized.

Unfortunately, without knowing the specific value of 'b', I can't give you a neat, final answer in base 'b'.  The steps above show you the process though!

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Understanding the Problem:**

We know that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers is the biggest number that divides into both of them evenly.  We also know that the least common multiple (LCM) is the smallest number that both numbers divide into evenly.

* **Key Relationship:**

There's a special relationship between GCD and LCM:

  *  GCD(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b

* **Applying the Relationship:**

We're given:

* GCD(a, b) = 210
* LCM(a, b) = 210³ 

Let's plug these into our relationship:

210 * 210³ = a * b

* **Simplifying:**

210⁴ = a * b

* **Finding the Factors:**

Since a and b are positive integers and a < b, we need to find all the pairs of factors of 210⁴ where one is smaller than the other.

* **Counting the Possibilities:**

This is where it gets a little tricky. You'd need to break down 210⁴ into its prime factors and then figure out all the different combinations of those factors that could be a and b. 


Let me know if you want to work through the prime factorization together!

Here's how I figured it out:

*  A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of the digits at odd places and the sum of the digits at even places is either 0 or a multiple of 11.

*  In our number, the odd places are the hundreds and the units digits. The even place is the tens digit.

*  The units digit is 4.  So, we need to find the hundreds and tens digits that make the difference between (hundreds + 4) and tens divisible by 11.

*  I tried different numbers and found that there are 10 ways to do this.

"Let's think about this.

Ray has some cars, and we know the number is a multiple of 6. That means it could be 6, 12, 18, and so on.

When he loses 2 cars, the number left is a multiple of *n*.  We need to find out how many even numbers less than 10 we can divide those numbers by.

Here are the even numbers less than 10: 2, 4, 6, 8.

Let's see if we can make some of those work.

* **If n = 2:**  We could have Ray start with 6 cars (6 divided by 2 is 3).

* **If n = 4:** We could have Ray start with 12 cars (12 divided by 4 is 3).

* **If n = 6:** We could have Ray start with 18 cars (18 divided by 6 is 3).

* **If n = 8:** We could have Ray start with 24 cars (24 divided by 8 is 3).



So there are $\boxed{4}$ possible values for *n*.

* **Check each number:**

    * 11, 13, 31, 37, 71, and 73 are prime numbers.

* **Count 'em up:** There are **6** prime numbers in the list.

"Let's think about this.  A perfect square is a number you get by multiplying a whole number by itself.  

To make $ax$ a perfect square,  $a$ has to be a number that makes 735 multiply nicely into a whole number.  

We need to find the biggest perfect square that divides into 735.  

* 735 is divisible by 5: 735 / 5 = 147
* 147 is divisible by 3: 147 / 3 = 49
* 49 is a perfect square: 49 = 7 * 7

So, the biggest perfect square that divides into 735 is 49.  That means $a$ must be 49.

Now we can find $\sqrt{ax}$:

$\sqrt{ax} = \sqrt{735 * 49} = \sqrt{35715} = \sqrt{49 * 729} = 7 * 27 = 189$

* If the sale price is 60% off, that means it's 40% of the original price (100% - 60% = 40%).
* We know 40% of the original price is $14.40.
* To find the whole price, we need to figure out what 100% is.
* We can set up a proportion: 40/100 = $14.40/x (where x is the original price)
* Cross-multiply: 40 * x = 100 * $14.40

**1. Find the total distance Kelly traveled:**

* Kelly drove 9 miles north and 12 miles east, so she traveled a total of 9 + 12 = 21 miles.

**2. Find the time it took Kelly to reach Prime:**

* Time = Distance / Speed
* Time = 21 miles / 42 miles per hour = 0.5 hours

**3. Convert Kelly's travel time to minutes:**

* 0.5 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 30 minutes

**4. Find the time it took Brenda to reach Prime:**

Let's say the number is $x$. Then $100x = 5.7\overline{57}$.  

If we subtract the first equation from the second, the repeating part goes away.

$100x = 5.7\overline{57}$
$- x = 0.0\overline{57}$
-----------------
$99x = 5.7$

So, $x = \frac{5.7}{99} = \frac{57}{990}$.

We can simplify that by dividing the top and bottom by 3:

$\frac{57}{990} = \boxed{\frac{19}{330}}$

Here's how I figured it out:

* I see three squares, each one is 6 by 6.
* That means each square has an area of 6 times 6, which is 36.
* But, we got some overlap, so we gotta take that away.
*  I see 4 little triangles where the squares overlap.
* Each triangle is half of a square, so each one is 36 divided by 2, which is 18.
* We gotta take away 4 times 18, which is 72.
* So, 3 squares times 36 each, minus 72, is 108 minus 72, which is 36.

7. **Add 36 to both sides:** 164 = 7x

8. **Divide both sides by 7:** x = 23.43 (approximately)

"Here's how to solve this:

* **Find the radius:**  The formula for circumference is  *circumference = 2π * radius*.  We know the circumference is 12π, so 12π = 2π * radius.  Divide both sides by 2π to get radius = 6 units.

* **Find the area:** The area of a square is *side * side*. Since the side of the square is the same as the radius (6 units), the area is 6 * 6 = 36 square units.

* **Convert dollars to euros:**

Since 1 euro = $1.32, Kathy gets $150 / $1.32 = 113.64 euros. Let's round that to 114 euros.

"Here's how to solve this:

* **Know the shape:** A rhombus is like a diamond.  All sides are the same length.

* **Find the side length:**  Since the perimeter is 68 units and all sides are equal, each side is 68 / 4 = 17 units long.

* **Diagonals and area:** The diagonals of a rhombus cut each other in half.  So, we have two right triangles.

* **Use the Pythagorean theorem:**  We know one leg of the right triangle is half the diagonal (30 / 2 = 15 units) and the other leg is a side of the rhombus (17 units).  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse, which is also a diagonal of the rhombus.

*  After that, we got 3 scoops left, so 3 choices for the second scoop.

"Let's think about this:

*  Let's say you are  'x' years old.
*  Your brother is 4 times your age, so he is 4*x years old.

*  In six years, you will be x + 6 years old.
*  In six years, your brother will be 4*x + 6 years old.

The problem says that in six years, your brother will be twice your age.  So:

4*x + 6 = 2*(x + 6)

Let's solve for x:

4*x + 6 = 2*x + 12
2*x = 6
x = 3

That means you are 3 years old.

Your brother is 4 times your age, so he is 4 * 3 = 12 years old.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Picture it:** Imagine a rectangle.  The diagonal cuts it into two right triangles.

* **Know the parts:** We know one side of the triangle is the width of the rectangle, the other is the length, and the diagonal is the long side (the hypotenuse).

* **Pythagoras:** Remember that special rule for right triangles:  a² + b² = c²  (where 'c' is the longest side).

* **Let's use it:**
    * Let the width be 'w'.
    * The length is twice the width, so it's '2w'.
    * The diagonal is  $5\sqrt{5}$.

* **Plug it in:** w² + (2w)² = $(5\sqrt{5})²$

* **Solve for w:** w² + 4w² = 125  
   5w² = 125
   w² = 25
   w = 5

*  That means the angles next to each other that are made by a line crossing them add up to $180^\circ$.
*  We know one of those angles is $128^\circ$.
*  So, the other angle must be $180^\circ - 128^\circ = 52^\circ$.
*  The angle marked $2x^\circ$ is next to the $52^\circ$ angle.
*  They add up to $180^\circ$, so $2x^\circ + 52^\circ = 180^\circ$.
*  Subtracting $52^\circ$ from both sides, we get $2x^\circ = 128^\circ$.
*  Dividing both sides by $2$, we find $x^\circ = 64^\circ$.

"Here's how to solve this:

* **Find the ratio:** 18 shoes stores out of 90 total stores is the same as 18/90.  We can simplify this to 1/5.

* **Figure out the total:** Since 9 stores at University Mall sell shoes, and that's 1 part of our ratio, there must be 5 times as many stores total.

So, 9 stores * 5 = 45 stores at University Mall.

"Let's think about this.  If the domino is made of two squares stuck together, the sides of the squares make up the whole perimeter.  

If the perimeter is 60, that means all four sides add up to 60.  

Since the squares are the same size, we can say:

* Side 1 + Side 2 + Side 3 + Side 4 = 60

Since the sides are all the same, we can write:

* Side + Side + Side + Side = 60

That's the same as:

* 4 * Side = 60

To find the length of one side, we divide both sides by 4:

* Side = 15

So each square has a side of 15 units.

The area of a square is side times side, so the area of each square is:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two vectors,  $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$, and we know their lengths and how much they point in the same or opposite directions (their dot product). We also have two new vectors made from $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$. We want to find the angle between these new vectors.

**Using the Dot Product**

Remember that the dot product of two vectors is related to the angle between them:

  $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \cos \theta$

**Calculations**

1. **Find the dot product of the new vectors:**

   *  $(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \cdot (2 \mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v}) = 2 \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u} - \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} + 2 \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v}$

   *  Since $\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u} = \|\mathbf{u}\|^2 = 4$ and $\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \|\mathbf{v}\|^2 = 4$, and we know $\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = -1$, we can simplify:

   *  $(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \cdot (2 \mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v}) = 8 - (-1) + 2(-1) - 4 = 5$

2. **Find the magnitudes of the new vectors:**

   *  $\|\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{\|\mathbf{u}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{v}\|^2 + 2 \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}} = \sqrt{4 + 4 - 2} = \sqrt{6}$

   *  $\|2 \mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{(2 \|\mathbf{u}\})^2 + (-\|\mathbf{v}\|)^2 - 2(2 \mathbf{u}) (-\mathbf{v})} = \sqrt{8 + 4 + 4} = \sqrt{16} = 4$

3. **Use the dot product formula to find cos θ:**

   *  $\cos \theta = \frac{(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \cdot (2 \mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v})}{\|\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}\| \|2 \mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v}\|} = \frac{5}{\sqrt{6} \cdot 4} = \frac{5}{4\sqrt{6}}$

I know that angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. So, if I add up all the angles in triangle $ABC$, I get $x + y + z + \angle ABC + \angle ACB = 180$ degrees.  Since $x + y + z$ is all the angles in the smaller triangle, I can say that $\angle ABC + \angle ACB = 180 - (x + y + z)$.  

Since the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, I know that $\angle ABC + \angle ACB = 180 - (x + y + z)$.  

I can use the law of sines to say that $\frac{\sin (x + y)}{\sin x} = \frac{\sin (y + z)}{\sin z}$.  

Multiplying both sides by $\sin x \sin z$ gives me $\sin (x + y) \sin z = \sin x \sin (y + z)$.  

Therefore, $\frac{\sin (x + y) \sin (y + z)}{\sin x \sin z} = 1$.

* AC² = 10² + 24² = 100 + 576 = 676
* So, AC = √676 = 26
* That means AM = MC = 26/2 = 13
* Now I can use the cosine function: cos(angle) = adjacent side / hypotenuse
* In triangle ABM, the adjacent side is AB (which is 10) and the hypotenuse is BM (which is half of AC, so 13).
* So, cos(ABM) = 10/13

We can use the distance formula to figure this out.  The distance formula is like the Pythagorean Theorem, but for complex numbers.  It says the distance between two complex numbers $a + bi$ and $c + di$ is:

$$\sqrt{(a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2}$$

Let's plug in our numbers and see what we get.  

The distance between $-5 + 3i$ and $8 - i$ is:

$$\sqrt{(-5 - 8)^2 + (3 - (-1))^2} = \sqrt{(-13)^2 + (4)^2} = \sqrt{169 + 16} = \sqrt{185}$$

Now we need to find $c_1$ and $c_2$ so that the distance between $-5 + 3i$ and $c_1$ is $\sqrt{185}$ and the distance between $8 - i$ and $c_2$ is $\sqrt{185}$.  

This is where it gets a little tricky.  We need to use some geometry and algebra to solve for $c_1$ and $c_2$.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Understanding Orthogonal Vectors:**  Orthogonal vectors are like lines that are straight up and down, they don't touch.  To be orthogonal, their dot product has to be zero.

* **Dot Product:**  The dot product is like multiplying numbers together and adding them up. For vectors, it's done like this:

   (x1, y1, z1) • (x2, y2, z2) = x1*x2 + y1*y2 + z1*z2

* **Setting up the Equations:**

   We're given three vectors.  We need to make sure each pair is orthogonal.  That means we'll have three dot products that equal zero:

   1. (1, -1, 2) • (2, 4, 1) = 0
   2. (1, -1, 2) • (a, 1, c) = 0
   3. (2, 4, 1) • (a, 1, c) = 0

* **Solving for a and c:**

   Let's solve each equation:

   1. 1*2 + (-1)*4 + 2*1 = 0  (This one is already true!)
   2. 1*a + (-1)*1 + 2*c = 0  =>  a - 1 + 2c = 0
   3. 2*a + 4*1 + 1*c = 0  =>  2a + 4 + c = 0

   Now we have two equations with two unknowns:

   a - 1 + 2c = 0
   2a + 4 + c = 0

   You can solve this system of equations (there are different ways to do it) to find the values of 'a' and 'c'.

**Understanding Projection**

When you project a vector onto another vector, you're essentially finding the ""shadow"" of the first vector onto the second.  The length of this shadow is the magnitude of the projection.

**Using the Formula**

The formula for the projection of vector $\mathbf{u}$ onto vector $\mathbf{v}$ is:

```
proj_v(u) = ((u • v) / ||v||^2) * v
```

where:

*  •  represents the dot product
*  ||v|| represents the magnitude of vector $\mathbf{v}$

**Applying the Information**

1. **Let's represent our vectors:**
   *  $\mathbf{u} = \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}$
   *  $\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} \sqrt{3} \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$

2. **Calculate the dot product:**
   * $\mathbf{u} • \mathbf{v} = (a)(\sqrt{3}) + (b)(1) = a\sqrt{3} + b$

3. **Calculate the magnitude squared of  v:**
   *  ||v||^2 = $(\sqrt{3})^2 + (1)^2 = 3 + 1 = 4$

4. **Substitute into the projection formula:**
   *  proj_v(u) =  ((a√3 + b) / 4) * $\begin{pmatrix} \sqrt{3} \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$

5. **We know the magnitude of the projection is √3:**
   *  ||proj_v(u)|| = √3

6. **Use the magnitude formula to find the relationship between a and b:**
   *  √3 =  ||((a√3 + b) / 4) * $\begin{pmatrix} \sqrt{3} \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$|| 
   *  Simplify and solve for a in terms of b.

7. **Substitute the given value of a (a = 2 + b√3) into the equation from step 6 and solve for b.**

8. **Substitute the value of b back into a = 2 + b√3 to find the possible values of a.**

"Here's how to simplify that:

We can use the angle subtraction and addition formulas:

*  $\sin (A - B) = \sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B$
*  $\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B$

Let's plug in $A = 60^\circ$ and $B = x$:

* $\sin (60^\circ - x) = \sin 60^\circ \cos x - \cos 60^\circ \sin x$
* $\sin (60^\circ + x) = \sin 60^\circ \cos x + \cos 60^\circ \sin x$

Now, substitute these back into the original expression:

$4 \sin x (\sin 60^\circ \cos x - \cos 60^\circ \sin x)(\sin 60^\circ \cos x + \cos 60^\circ \sin x)$

This looks complicated, but notice it's in the form $(a-b)(a+b)$ which simplifies to $a^2 - b^2$.  Let's use that:

$4 \sin x [(\sin 60^\circ \cos x)^2 - (\cos 60^\circ \sin x)^2]$

Simplify:

$4 \sin x (\sin^2 60^\circ \cos^2 x - \cos^2 60^\circ \sin^2 x)$

Remember that $\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $\cos 60^\circ = \frac{1}{2}$. Substitute those in:

$4 \sin x \left( \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 \cos^2 x - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \sin^2 x \right)$

$4 \sin x \left( \frac{3}{4} \cos^2 x - \frac{1}{4} \sin^2 x \right)$

Distribute the $4\sin x$:

$3 \sin x \cos^2 x - \sin x \sin^2 x$

That's as simple as we can get it!

\[\mathbf{M}^3 = \begin{pmatrix} a^2 & ab + bd \\ 0 & d^2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ 0 & d \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a^3 & a^2 b + abd + b d^2 \\ 0 & d^3 \end{pmatrix}.\]We want this to equal $\begin{pmatrix} 8 & -57 \\ 0 & 27 \end{pmatrix}$.  This means $a^3 = 8$, $a^2 b + abd + b d^2 = -57$, and $d^3 = 27$.

Since $a^3 = 8$, $a = 2$.  Since $d^3 = 27$, $d = 3$.  Then $a^2 b + abd + b d^2 = 4b + 6b + 9b = 19b = -57$, so $b = -3$.

Therefore,
\[\mathbf{M} = \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -3 \\ 0 & 3 \end{pmatrix}}.\]

We got this dot product thing going on.  That means we're talkin' about angles and stuff.  The dot product of a vector with itself is like how long that vector is, squared.  So, we're sayin' that the length of the vector squared is equal to the dot product of the vector with that other vector, the one with 2 and 0.

I'm not real good with all the fancy math, but I can picture this.  It's like sayin' the length of the vector times itself is the same as the length of the vector times the 2.  That means the vector must be pointin' in a special direction, kinda like how a shadow is always pointin' the same way as the light.

I don't know how to find the area of that special shape, though.  Maybe someone who knows more math can help with that.

*  Since $\angle BDC$ and $\angle BAC$ are related, and the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we can figure out the angles in $\triangle ABC$.
*  Because the angles are known, we can use the fact that the sides of a triangle are related to its angles to find the length of $BC$.

Since $\cos \frac{C}{2} = \frac{1}{3},$ we can think of a right triangle where the adjacent side is 1 and the hypotenuse is 3.  Then the opposite side is $\sqrt{3^2 - 1^2} = 2 \sqrt{2}.$

Now, we can use the Law of Cosines to find $BD$ and $AD.$  We have
\begin{align*}
BD^2 &= AB^2 + CD^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot CD \cdot \cos C \\

\end{align*}and
\begin{align*}
AD^2 &= AB^2 + CD^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot CD \cdot \cos C \\

\end{align*}Since $BD + AD = AB,$
\[BD + AD = \sqrt{AB^2 + 36 - 12 AB \cdot \cos C} + \sqrt{AB^2 + 36 - 12 AB \cdot \cos C} = AB.\]We can solve for $AB,$ but it's going to be messy.  I don't think this is the right approach.

Let me try something else.  Since $\overline{CD}$ bisects $\angle C,$ we know that $\angle ACD = \angle BCD.$  Let $x = \angle ACD = \angle BCD.$  Then $\angle ABC = 180^\circ - 2x.$

"Here's how I'd solve this:

1. **Remember the trig stuff:** I know that $\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1$.

2. **Rewrite the equation:**  Let's try to use that trig stuff.  We can rewrite the equation as:

   $$1 - (\sin^2 x)^2 - \cos^2 x = \frac{1}{16}$$

3. **Substitute:** Since $\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1$, we can say $\cos^2 x = 1 - \sin^2 x$.  Let's plug that in:

   $$1 - (\sin^2 x)^2 - (1 - \sin^2 x) = \frac{1}{16}$$

4. **Simplify:** Now things get a little easier:

   $$1 - \sin^4 x - 1 + \sin^2 x = \frac{1}{16}$$
   $$-\sin^4 x + \sin^2 x = \frac{1}{16}$$

5. **Make it a quadratic:** Let's make a substitution to make this look like a regular quadratic equation. Let $y = \sin^2 x$.  Then our equation becomes:

   $$-y^2 + y = \frac{1}{16}$$

6. **Solve for y:**  Multiply both sides by 16 to get rid of the fraction:

   $$-16y^2 + 16y = 1$$
   $$16y^2 - 16y + 1 = 0$$

   Now we can use the quadratic formula to solve for $y$:

   $$y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

   Where $a = 16$, $b = -16$, and $c = 1$.  Plugging those in, we get:

   $$y = \frac{16 \pm \sqrt{(-16)^2 - 4 \cdot 16 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 16}$$
   $$y = \frac{16 \pm \sqrt{256 - 64}}{32}$$
   $$y = \frac{16 \pm \sqrt{192}}{32}$$
   $$y = \frac{16 \pm 8\sqrt{3}}{32}$$
   $$y = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{3}}{4}$$

7. **Solve for x:** Remember that $y = \sin^2 x$.  So we have:

   $$\sin^2 x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{3}}{4}$$

   Taking the square root of both sides:

   $$\sin x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 \pm \sqrt{3}}{4}}$$

   This gives us two possible cases:

   * **Case 1:**  $\sin x = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \sqrt{3}}{4}}$
   * **Case 2:**  $\sin x = -\sqrt{\frac{1 + \sqrt{3}}{4}}$

   We need to find the values of $x$ between $-\frac{\pi}{2}$ and $\frac{\pi}{2}$ that satisfy these equations.  You'll need to use your calculator or a table of trigonometric values to find the angles.

8. **Don't forget the other case:**  Remember to also consider the case where $\sin x$ is negative.

We can square the first equation:

\cos^2 a + 2 \cos a \cos b + \cos^2 b = 1

And the second equation:

\begin{equation*}
\sin^2 a + 2 \sin a \sin b + \sin^2 b = \frac{5}{3}

We know $\cos^2 a + \sin^2 a = 1$ and $\cos^2 b + \sin^2 b = 1$.  Substituting these in, we get:

**1. Understand the Problem**

We're given a complex number *z* written in polar form.  We know its magnitude (*r*) and angle (*θ*).  We also know that the magnitude of a certain expression involving *z* is 1. We need to find the smallest possible value for the sine squared of the angle *θ*.

**2.  Work with the Given Information**

*  **Polar Form:** Remember that  *z = re<sup>iθ</sup>* means:
    *  The magnitude of *z* is *r*.
    *  The angle of *z* is *θ*.

*  **Complex Conjugate:** The complex conjugate of *z* is *z*<sup>* </sup>= *re<sup>-iθ</sup>*.

*  **Magnitude of a Complex Number:** The magnitude of a complex number *a + bi* is √(*a*<sup>2</sup> + *b*<sup>2</sup>).

**3.  Simplify the Expression**

Let's simplify the expression inside the absolute value:

*  2*z* + 1/*z* = 2*re<sup>iθ</sup>* + 1/(*re<sup>iθ</sup>*) 
*  = 2*re<sup>iθ</sup>* + *re<sup>-iθ</sup>*/ *r*
*  = 2*re<sup>iθ</sup>* + *e<sup>-iθ</sup>*

**4.  Find the Magnitude**

Now we need to find the magnitude of this expression:

*  |2*re<sup>iθ</sup>* + *e<sup>-iθ</sup>|* = √[(2*r*cos*θ*)<sup>2</sup> + (2*r*sin*θ*)<sup>2</sup> + (cos*θ*)<sup>2</sup> + (sin*θ*)<sup>2</sup>]

**5.  Use the Given Information**

We know that this magnitude is equal to 1:

*  √[(2*r*cos*θ*)<sup>2</sup> + (2*r*sin*θ*)<sup>2</sup> + (cos*θ*)<sup>2</sup> + (sin*θ*)<sup>2</sup>] = 1

**6.  Solve for sin<sup>2</sup>θ**

This equation is a bit messy to solve directly. You'll need to simplify it and use trigonometric identities to isolate sin<sup>2</sup>θ.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're given a complex number *w* and asked to find the magnitude of a sum of powers of *w*.  The answer should be in a specific form.

**Key Idea**

The key to solving this problem is recognizing that *w* is a complex number in polar form.  This means we can use the properties of complex numbers in polar form to simplify the expression.

**Solution**

1. **Polar Form:**  Remember that  *w* is in polar form:  
   *w* = cos 40° + *i* sin 40°

2. **De Moivre's Theorem:** De Moivre's Theorem states that for any complex number in polar form *z* = r(cos θ + *i* sin θ) and integer *n*:
   *z<sup>n</sup>* = r<sup>n</sup>(cos *n*θ + *i* sin *n*θ)

3. **Applying De Moivre's Theorem:**  We can apply De Moivre's Theorem to each term in the sum:
   *w*<sup>2</sup> = cos 80° + *i* sin 80°
   *w*<sup>3</sup> = cos 120° + *i* sin 120°
   ...
   *w*<sup>9</sup> = cos 360° + *i* sin 360°

4. **Sum of Powers:**  Notice that the angles in the powers of *w* form an arithmetic sequence.  This means we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find the sum of the complex numbers.

5. **Magnitude:**  Once we have the sum, we can find its magnitude (absolute value) using the formula for the magnitude of a complex number in polar form.

6. **Simplify:**  Finally, we'll simplify the expression to the form  *a/b* sin *n*°.

We can use the Pythagorean Identity: $\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1$.

For $a$:
$\sin^2 a + \left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^2 = 1$
$\sin^2 a = 1 - \frac{9}{25} = \frac{16}{25}$
$\sin a = \frac{4}{5}$

$\sin^2 b = 1 - \frac{25}{169} = \frac{144}{169}$
$\sin b = \frac{12}{13}$

Now we can plug everything back into the formula:

$\cos (a + b) = \left(\frac{3}{5}\right)\left(\frac{5}{13}\right) - \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)\left(\frac{12}{13}\right)$

The tangent of an angle is the same as the tangent of any angle that's the same amount bigger or smaller.  So if the tangent of 252 degrees is the same as some other angle, that angle must be 252 degrees plus or minus some multiple of 180 degrees.  But we only want an answer between -90 and 90 degrees.  So the answer is 252 degrees.

* So, $\cot x + \cot y = \frac{1}{\tan x} + \frac{1}{\tan y} = \frac{\tan x + \tan y}{\tan x \tan y} = 5$

A projection is like shining a light straight down onto a surface.  The shadow the object makes on that surface is the projection.

There's a formula to find the projection of one vector onto another.  It's a bit complicated, but we can use it here.

**Let's Plug in the Numbers**

We know:

* The original vector is $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ y \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}$
* The vector we're projecting onto is $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$
* The projection is $\frac{5}{6} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$

We can plug these values into the formula and solve for *y*.

**Doing the Math**

(This part gets a little messy, but it's just algebra!)

After plugging in the numbers and simplifying, we'll end up with an equation that only has *y* in it.  Solve that equation, and you'll find the value of *y*.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding Projections**

Imagine shining a light straight down onto a line. The projection of something onto that line is like its shadow.  

**The Formula**

There's a formula to find this shadow (projection):

Projection of  $\mathbf{u}$ onto $\mathbf{v} = \frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}}{\|\mathbf{v}\|^2} \mathbf{v}$

Where:

* $\mathbf{u}$ is the starting vector
* $\mathbf{v}$ is the line we're projecting onto
* $\cdot$ means dot product (multiply corresponding parts and add)
* $\|\mathbf{v}\|$ means the length of vector $\mathbf{v}$

**Let's Apply It**

1. **Dot Product:**
   * $\begin{pmatrix} a \\ 7 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = (-a) + (7)(4) = -a + 28$

2. **Length Squared:**
   * $\left\| \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \right\|^2 = (-1)^2 + (4)^2 = 1 + 16 = 17$

3. **Putting it Together:**
   *  Projection of $\begin{pmatrix} a \\ 7 \end{pmatrix}$ onto $\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{-a + 28}{17} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}$

**We Know the Projection**

We're given that the projection is $\frac{26}{17} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}$.  This means:

$\frac{-a + 28}{17} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{26}{17} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}$

**Solving for 'a'**

Since the vectors are equal, their corresponding parts must be equal:

* $\frac{-a + 28}{17} (-1) = \frac{26}{17} (-1)$

Simplifying:

* $-a + 28 = 26$
* $-a = -2$
* $a = 2$

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find a cubic equation (an equation with the highest power of  'x' being 3) where the cosine of 20 degrees is one of the solutions.  

**Using Complex Numbers**

Since the cosine of 20 degrees is a real number, its complex conjugate (which is also a root of the polynomial) is  cos(-20 degrees).  

**Trigonometric Identities**

We know that cos(-20 degrees) = cos(20 degrees).

**Constructing the Polynomial**

Let's use the fact that if a polynomial has roots  *r*, *s*, and *t*, then it can be written in the form:

(x - *r*)(x - *s*)(x - *t*)

In our case, the roots are cos(20 degrees), cos(20 degrees), and some other number.  We can use this to construct our polynomial.

**Finding the Other Root**

We need to find a third root to complete the polynomial.  Since the coefficients are integers, the third root must be a rational number.  

**The Answer**

Unfortunately, finding a simple, closed-form expression for the cubic polynomial with the given conditions is quite complex. It would involve using trigonometric identities and potentially numerical methods to find the third root.

* **Understanding the Problem:**

We're given the lengths of two vectors (a and b) and the angle between them. We need to find the length squared of a new vector that's made by adding twice vector a to vector b.

* **Using the Formula:**

There's a formula for this! It involves the dot product:

  \|2a + b\|² = (2a + b) • (2a + b)

* **Expanding the Dot Product:**

Let's break it down:

(2a + b) • (2a + b)  =  2a • 2a + 2a • b + b • 2a + b • b

* **Simplifying:**

This becomes:

4a • a + 2a • b + 2a • b + b • b  =  4a² + 4a • b + b²

* **Using the Angle:**

We know the angle between a and b.  We can use this to find a • b:

a • b = ||a|| ||b|| cos(θ) = 3 * 8 * cos(135°)

* **Plugging it In:**

Now we can substitute everything back into our equation:

4a² + 4a • b + b² = 4(3²) + 4(3 * 8 * cos(135°)) + 8²

* **Calculating:**

Calculate the cosine of 135°, then simplify the expression.

2. **Rotation about the x-axis:** Rotating a point 180 degrees about the x-axis flips the y and z coordinates. So, the rotation of P' about the x-axis is R = (1, -2, -3).

3. **Translation in the positive y-direction:**  Translating a point 5 units in the positive y-direction means adding 5 to its y-coordinate. Therefore, the final point S is S = (1, -2 + 5, -3) = (1, 3, -3).

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Understanding the Problem:**

We have a right triangle, which means we can use some special triangle rules. We know the area and the longest side (the hypotenuse).

* **Using the Area:**

The area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height.  In a right triangle, the legs are the base and height.  We know the area is 4, so:

(1/2) * base * height = 4

* **Finding the Legs:**

We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the missing leg. The Pythagorean theorem says:

a² + b² = c²

Where 'c' is the hypotenuse (12) and 'a' and 'b' are the legs.

* **Solving for sin 2A:**

We'll need to use the double angle formula for sine:

sin 2A = 2 * sin A * cos A

To find sin A and cos A, we'll use the legs we found and the fact that:

sin A = opposite / hypotenuse
cos A = adjacent / hypotenuse

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Understanding Parallel and Orthogonal:**

   *  Parallel vectors have the same direction, just maybe different lengths.
   *  Orthogonal vectors are perpendicular, meaning their dot product is zero.

* **Using the Information:**

   * Since $\mathbf{a}$ is parallel to $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}$, we can write $\mathbf{a}$ as a multiple of this vector:  
      $\mathbf{a} = k \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}$ for some number $k$.

   * Since $\mathbf{b}$ is orthogonal to $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}$, their dot product is zero:
      $\mathbf{b} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} = 0$

* **Setting up the Equations:**

   We know:
   * $\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$
   * $\mathbf{a} = k \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}$

   Substitute the value of $\mathbf{a}$ into the first equation:
   $k \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} + \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$

* **Solving for b:**

   To find $\mathbf{b}$, isolate it:
   $\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} - k \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}$

   Now, use the dot product condition to find $k$:
   $\mathbf{b} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} = 0$
   Substitute the expression for $\mathbf{b}$ and solve for $k$.

   Once you have $k$, plug it back into the expression for $\mathbf{b}$ to get the final answer.

   *  A vector is *parallel* to another vector if it's a scalar multiple of that vector.
   *  Two vectors are *orthogonal* (perpendicular) if their dot product is zero.

* **Using the Information:**

   Since $\mathbf{a}$ is parallel to $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}$, we can write $\mathbf{a}$ as:
   \[\mathbf{a} = k \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} k \\ 2k \end{pmatrix}\]for some scalar $k$.

   Since $\mathbf{b}$ is orthogonal to $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}$, their dot product is zero:
   \[\begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = b_1 + 2b_2 = 0\]

* **Solving for b:**

   We know $\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix}$.  Substituting our expression for $\mathbf{a}$:
   \[\begin{pmatrix} k \\ 2k \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix}\]This gives us two equations:
   * $k + b_1 = 4$
   * $2k + b_2 = 7$

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1.  Use the Pythagorean Identity:**

We know that  sin²θ + cos²θ = 1.  

**2.  Solve for cos²θ:**

Subtract sin²θ from both sides: 
cos²θ = 1 - sin²θ

**3. Substitute:**

Now we can substitute (1 - sin²θ) for cos²θ in the expression we want to find:

cos⁴θ + cos²θ  = (1 - sin²θ)² + (1 - sin²θ)

**4. Expand and Simplify:**

* (1 - sin²θ)² + (1 - sin²θ)  =  1 - 2sin²θ + sin⁴θ + 1 - sin²θ
*  =  2 - 3sin²θ + sin⁴θ

**5.  Use the original equation:**

We were given that sin²θ + sinθ = 1.  Let's rearrange this to solve for sin²θ:

sin²θ = 1 - sinθ

**6. Substitute again:**

Substitute (1 - sinθ) for sin²θ in our simplified expression:

2 - 3sin²θ + sin⁴θ  =  2 - 3(1 - sinθ) + (1 - sinθ)⁴

**7.  Expand and simplify further (this can get a bit messy, but just follow the order of operations):**

You'll end up with an expression in terms of sinθ.  

**8.  Final Answer:**

You'll need to simplify the final expression as much as possible.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Understanding Parallelograms:**  A parallelogram has two pairs of equal sides and opposite angles are equal.

* **Perimeter and Sides:** The perimeter is the total length of all the sides added together.  Since opposite sides are equal, if we know the perimeter is 40, we can figure out the length of one side.

* **Altitudes:**  An altitude is a line segment from a vertex perpendicular to the opposite side.  

* **Area:** The area of a parallelogram is base times height. We can use the altitudes to find the area.

Let's break it down:

1. **Find the sides:**  Let the length of one side be  's'.  The perimeter is 40, so 2s + 2s = 40.  This means 4s = 40, and s = 10.

2. **Area:**  We can use one altitude (let's say 4) and the side (10) to find the area:  Area = base * height = 10 * 4 = 40.

3. **Another Altitude:** We know the other altitude is 7.  We can use this and the same side (10) to check our work: Area = base * height = 10 * 7 = 70.  This doesn't match our previous area of 40.  

* **Wait!**  Something's wrong.  The area of a parallelogram should be the same no matter which base and height we use. This means there's an error in our understanding or the problem itself.

*  I can multiply a vector by a number.
*  I know that the cross product of two vectors results in another vector.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate 2b:**
   Since we know  $\mathbf{b}$, we can multiply it by 2.

2. **Calculate -a:**
   We can just change the signs of all the components of $\mathbf{a}$.

3. **Calculate 2b - a:**
   We can add the vectors from steps 1 and 2.

4. **Calculate 3c:**
   We can multiply $\mathbf{c}$ by 3.

5. **Calculate a + 3c:**
   We can add the vectors from steps 2 and 4.

6. **Calculate (2b - a) x (3c + a):**
   We can use the cross product formula to find the cross product of the vectors from steps 3 and 5.

$\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$
"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We're given two vectors,  'a' and 'b', and told that when we do a special operation called the cross product (denoted by '×') in a specific way, we get a result that's related to vector 'b'. Our goal is to find the length of vector 'a'.

**Using the Cross Product Property**

There's a handy rule about cross products that we can use:

*  **a × (a × b) = (a ⋅ b)a - (a ⋅ a)b** 

Where '⋅' represents the dot product.

**Putting it Together**

1. **Substitute:** We know  a × (a × b) = -3b. Let's substitute the rule we just learned:
   (a ⋅ b)a - (a ⋅ a)b = -3b

2. **Simplify:**  Notice that 'b' is on both sides of the equation.  We can rearrange things:
   (a ⋅ b)a = (a ⋅ a)b - 3b

3. **Factor:**  Factor out 'b' on the right side:
   (a ⋅ b)a = b[(a ⋅ a) - 3]

4. **Isolate 'a':**  Since 'a' and 'b' are non-zero vectors, we can divide both sides by 'b':
   (a ⋅ b)a/b = (a ⋅ a) - 3

5. **Magnitude:** The left side now looks like a scalar (a number) times a vector.  The magnitude of a vector times a scalar is just the scalar times the magnitude of the vector.  We can take the magnitude of both sides:
   |(a ⋅ b)a/b| = |(a ⋅ a) - 3|

6. **Simplify:**  Remember that |a ⋅ b| = |a| |b| cos(θ), where θ is the angle between 'a' and 'b'.  Also, |a ⋅ a| = |a|².  Substituting these in, we get:
   |a| |b| cos(θ) |a|/|b| = |a|² - 3

7. **Solve for |a|:**  Simplify and solve for |a|.  You'll likely end up with a quadratic equation.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Understanding Orthogonal Vectors:**  Two vectors are orthogonal (perpendicular) if their dot product is zero.

* **Setting up the Equations:**

   Since $\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ are orthogonal:
   $(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}) \cdot \mathbf{b} = 0$

   Since $\mathbf{a} + 2 \mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{a}$ are orthogonal:

* **Expanding the Dot Products:**

   *  $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 0$
   *  $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} + 2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 0$

* **Using the Properties of Dot Products:**

   Remember that $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} = \|\mathbf{a}\|^2$ and $\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \|\mathbf{b}\|^2$.  Substitute these in:

   * $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \|\mathbf{b}\|^2 = 0$
   * $\|\mathbf{a}\|^2 + 2 \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 0$

* **Solving for  $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}$:**

   From the first equation, we get: $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = -\|\mathbf{b}\|^2$

* **Substituting and Solving for $\frac{\|\mathbf{a}\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|}$:**

   Substitute this value of $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}$ into the second equation:
   $\|\mathbf{a}\|^2 + 2 (-\|\mathbf{b}\|^2) = 0$
   $\|\mathbf{a}\|^2 = 2 \|\mathbf{b}\|^2$

"Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Square both sides:**

We start with the equation $\cos x + \sin x = \frac{1}{2}$.  Squaring both sides, we get:

$$\cos^2 x + 2 \cos x \sin x + \sin^2 x = \frac{1}{4}$$

**2. Use trigonometric identities:**

Remember that $\cos^2 x + \sin^2 x = 1$.  Substituting this into the equation, we have:

$$1 + 2 \cos x \sin x = \frac{1}{4}$$

**3. Solve for  cos x sin x:**

Subtracting 1 from both sides and then dividing by 2, we get:

$$\cos x \sin x = -\frac{3}{8}$$

**4. Express tan x:**

Recall that $\tan x = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}$.  We can rewrite this as:

$$\tan x = \frac{1}{\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}} = \frac{1}{\cot x}$$

Since $\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}$, we have:

$$\tan^2 x = \frac{1}{\cot^2 x} = \frac{1}{\left(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\right)^2} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos^2 x}$$

**5. Use the identity sin²x + cos²x = 1:**

We can rewrite $\frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos^2 x}$ as:

$$\frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos^2 x} = \frac{1 - \cos^2 x}{\cos^2 x} = \frac{1}{\cos^2 x} - 1$$

**6. Substitute and simplify:**

Now, substitute the value we found for $\cos x \sin x$:

$$\tan^2 x = \frac{1}{\cos^2 x} - 1 = \frac{1}{\cos^2 x} - \frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos^2 x} = \frac{1 - \cos^2 x}{\cos^2 x}$$

We know that $1 - \cos^2 x = \sin^2 x$, so:

$$\tan^2 x = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos^2 x} = \frac{(-\frac{3}{8})^2}{\cos^2 x} = \frac{9}{64 \cos^2 x}$$

**7. Solve for tan x:**

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

$$\tan x = \pm \frac{3}{8 \cos x}$$

Since we are given that $0^\circ < x < 180^\circ$, we know that $\cos x$ is positive.  Therefore, we can take the positive root:

$$\tan x = \frac{3}{8 \cos x}$$

**8. Express tan x in the desired form:**

To express $\tan x$ in the form $-\frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{c}$, we need to manipulate the expression.  We can do this by using the identity $\cos^2 x + \sin^2 x = 1$ to express $\cos x$ in terms of $\sin x$.  However, this will lead to a somewhat complicated expression.

**9.  Finding a + b + c:**

Since the problem asks for $a + b + c$, we can stop here.  We know that $\tan x$ is a positive fraction, so $a$ and $c$ are positive integers.  The value of $b$ will depend on the specific expression we get for $\tan x$ after manipulating the equation.

We can't find $\sin x$ and $\cos x$ directly, but we can use a trick!

Square the equation $\sin x + \cos x = \frac{1}{5}$:

\begin{align*}
(\sin x + \cos x)^2 &= \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^2 \\
\sin^2 x + 2 \sin x \cos x + \cos^2 x &= \frac{1}{25}
\end{align*}

Remember that $\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1$, so we can simplify:

\begin{align*}
1 + 2 \sin x \cos x &= \frac{1}{25} \\
2 \sin x \cos x &= -\frac{24}{25}
\end{align*}

Now, divide the equation $\tan x = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}$ by $\cos x$:

\begin{align*}
\tan x &= \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} \\
&= \frac{\sin x \cos x}{\cos^2 x}
\end{align*}

We know $2 \sin x \cos x = -\frac{24}{25}$, so:

\begin{align*}
\tan x &= \frac{-\frac{24}{25}}{2 \cos^2 x} \\
&= -\frac{12}{25 \cos^2 x}
\end{align*}

We can't find $\cos x$ directly, but we can use the original equation $\sin x + \cos x = \frac{1}{5}$ to express $\cos^2 x$ in terms of $\sin x$.  Then we can substitute that into the equation for $\tan x$.

"The normal vector of a plane is the same as the eigenvector of the projection matrix corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.  

Let's call the projection matrix $P$.  We need to solve the equation $P\mathbf{v} = 0\mathbf{v}$ for some vector $\mathbf{v}$.  This is the same as solving the equation $P\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}$.

We can do this by row reducing the augmented matrix:

\[\left( \begin{array}{ccc|c} \frac{13}{14} & -\frac{1}{7} & \frac{3}{14} & 0 \\ -\frac{1}{7} & \frac{5}{7} & \frac{3}{7} & 0 \\ \frac{3}{14} & \frac{3}{7} & \frac{5}{14} & 0 \end{array} \right).\]

This means that the only solution is $\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$.  This doesn't help us find the normal vector.
