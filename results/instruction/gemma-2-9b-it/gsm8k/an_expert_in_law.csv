"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let 'x' be the original number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had.**

* **Green House:** She sold x/3.
* **Red House:** She sold 2 more, so she had x/3 + 2 left.
* **Orange House:** She sold half of what was left, meaning she sold (x/3 + 2) / 2.
* **Remaining:** She has 5 left, so  x - (x/3) - 2 - (x/3 + 2)/2 = 5

Now we can solve for x:

1. Simplify the equation: x - x/3 - 2 - x/6 - 1 = 5
2. Combine like terms: (6x - 2x - 6 - x - 6)/6 = 5
3. Simplify further: (3x - 12)/6 = 5
4. Multiply both sides by 6: 3x - 12 = 30

* Let Lylah's original salary be represented by ""L"".
* Adrien's original salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, so Adrien's original salary was 1.30L.

**2. Calculate Adrien's salary four years later:**

* Adrien's salary increased by 40% from his salary four years ago, which was $40,000.
* His salary four years later is $40,000 * 1.40 = $56,000

**3. Calculate Lylah's salary four years later:**

*  We know Adrien's original salary was 1.30L and his salary four years later is $56,000.  
*  Since their salaries increased simultaneously, we can set up a proportion: (1.30L) * (1 + increase percentage) = $56,000
*  We don't know Lylah's specific increase percentage, but we know Adrien's was 40%.  We can assume Lylah had the same percentage increase.
*  Let's plug in 0.40 for the increase percentage: (1.30L) * (1 + 0.40) = $56,000
*  Simplify: (1.30L) * (1.40) = $56,000
*  Solve for L: 1.82L = $56,000
*  L = $56,000 / 1.82 = $30,770 (approximately)
*  Lylah's salary four years later is: $30,770 * (1 + 0.40) = $43,078 (approximately)

**4. Calculate their combined salary four years later:**

* Adrien's salary four years later: $56,000

    * Let 'B' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
    * Let 'D' represent the number of insects David found.
    * Let 'L' represent the number of insects Lily found.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  L + D + B = 43  (Total insects)
    *  L = D + 7       (Lily found 7 more than David)
    *  D = B / 2        (David found half of what Bodhi found)

* **Solve for the variables:**

    1. **Substitute** the second and third equations into the first equation:
       (D + 7) + D + (D * 2) = 43

    2. **Simplify** the equation:
       4D + 7 = 43

    3. **Subtract** 7 from both sides:
       4D = 36

    4. **Divide** both sides by 4:
       D = 9

    5. **Now that you know D (David's insects), find L (Lily's insects):**
       L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

* **Answer:** Lily found 16 insects.

**Step 1: Trading Small Stickers**

* Lorraine trades 90% of her 30 small stickers: 0.90 * 30 = 27 small stickers
* This earns her 27 / 1 = 27 large buttons (since each small sticker is worth one small button)

**Step 2: Trading Large Stickers**

* Lorraine trades 50% of her 40 large stickers: 0.50 * 40 = 20 large stickers
* This earns her 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers (since each large button is worth three small stickers)

* She has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers remaining.
* She trades these for small buttons: 20 * 1 = 20 small buttons

**Step 3: Total Buttons**

* Lorraine now has 27 large buttons + 60 small stickers + 20 small stickers = 27 large buttons + 80 small stickers

"Let's break down this problem step by step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of ounces of citrus zest (and fragrance, since they are equal).**

* **Salt and sugar are equal, so they are also 'x' ounces each.**

* **Oil is twice the amount of salt, meaning she uses 2x ounces of oil.**

* **The total weight of all ingredients is 10 ounces:** x + x + x + 2x + 2x = 10

* **Combine like terms:** 6x = 10

* **Solve for x:** x = 10/6 = 1.67 ounces (approximately)

* **Calculate the amount of oil:** 2x = 2 * 1.67 = 3.34 ounces (approximately)

"Let's break down this problem:

* Let Peter's age be represented by ""P""
* Let Paul's age be represented by ""Pa""
* Let John's age be represented by ""J""

We know:

* P + Pa + J = 100  (The combined age of all three)
* Pa = J + 10       (Paul is 10 years older than John)
* P = Pa + J        (Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's ages)

Now we can use substitution to solve for Peter's age (P):

1. **Substitute** the second equation (Pa = J + 10) into the third equation: 
   P = (J + 10) + J
   P = 2J + 10

2. **Substitute** both the second equation (Pa = J + 10) and the modified third equation (P = 2J + 10) into the first equation:
   (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

3. **Simplify** and solve for J:
   4J + 20 = 100
   4J = 80
   J = 20

4. **Substitute** the value of J (20) back into the equation P = 2J + 10 to find Peter's age:
   P = (2 * 20) + 10
   P = 40 + 10
   P = 50

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Step 1: Calculate the charge lost in the first 5 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 9% of its capacity per hour for 5 hours, so it lost 9 * 5 = 45% of its charge.

* **Step 2: Calculate the charge remaining after the first 5 hours:**
   -  If the final charge was 28%, and it lost 45% in the first 5 hours, it must have had 28% + 45% = 73% charge before that.

* **Step 3: Calculate the charge lost in the next 3 hours:**
   - The power bank lost 7% of its capacity per hour for 3 hours, so it lost 7 * 3 = 21% of its charge.

* **Step 4: Calculate the initial charge:**
   -  After losing 21% in the next 3 hours, the power bank had 73% - 21% = 52% charge.


**Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 52%.**

*  ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now"":  W = 5(C + 7) 
*  ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now"": C + 25 = (1/3)W

**Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:**

1. **Solve for W in terms of C in the first equation:**
   W = 5C + 35

2. **Substitute this value of W into the second equation:**
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35)

3. **Simplify and solve for C:**
   3C + 75 = 5C + 35
   40 = 2C
   C = 20


**Therefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.**

* **Vanessa's time:** To find Vanessa's time, we need to know her speed. We know Aaron's speed is twice hers, so we can figure out her time per mile and then multiply that by her total distance.

Let's break it down:

1. **Find Aaron's time per mile:** 16 minutes / (unknown distance) = time per mile
2. **Find Vanessa's time per mile:** (Aaron's time per mile) / 2 = Vanessa's time per mile
3. **Calculate Vanessa's total time:** (Vanessa's time per mile) * 8 miles = Vanessa's total time 



**Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to determine Vanessa's exact time.** We need to know how many miles Aaron ran to calculate his time per mile.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Calculate the profit:**

* Profit percentage = 25%
* Profit amount = (25/100) * $80 = $20

**2. Calculate the total selling price:**

* Total cost price = $80
* Total selling price = Cost price + Profit = $80 + $20 = $100

**3. Calculate the selling price per watermelon:**

* Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons 
* Selling price per watermelon = $100 / 50 = $2

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Dora's current age:** Since Dora will be 12 in 3 years, she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.
* **James's current age:** James is twice Dora's age, so he is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.
* **John's youngest son's current age:** John was 32 when his youngest son was born, and he is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.  Therefore, his youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old.
* **John's youngest son's age in 3 years:** In 3 years, his youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

* **Calculate oranges peeled per minute:**
    * Ana peels 1 orange every 3 minutes.
    * Jane peels 1 orange every 4 minutes.

* **Calculate oranges peeled per hour:**
    * Ana peels 60 minutes / 3 minutes/orange = 20 oranges in an hour.
    * Jane peels 60 minutes / 4 minutes/orange = 15 oranges in an hour.

* **Find the difference:**
    * Ana peels 20 oranges - 15 oranges = 5 more oranges than Jane.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of chickens and 'w' represent the number of cows.**

* **We know:**
    * c + w = 20 (total number of animals)
    * 2c + 4w = 70 (total number of legs)

* **Solve for 'c' (number of chickens):**

One way to solve this is using substitution:

1.  Solve the first equation for 'w':  w = 20 - c
2.  Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation: 2c + 4(20 - c) = 70
3.  Simplify and solve for 'c': 2c + 80 - 4c = 70  =>  -2c = -10  =>  c = 5
