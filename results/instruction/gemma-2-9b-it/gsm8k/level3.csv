"Let's work backwards to solve this problem:

* **Orange House:** Since Melanie had 5 vacuum cleaners left after selling half at the orange house, she must have had 5 * 2 = 10 vacuum cleaners before that.
* **Red House:** Before selling 2 vacuum cleaners at the red house, she had 10 + 2 = 12 vacuum cleaners.

**2.  Calculate the price after the first two months:**

* $20 + $4 = $24

**3.  Repeat the process for each two-month period:**

*  After 4 months: $24 + (20% of $24) = $28.80
*  After 6 months: $28.80 + (20% of $28.80) = $34.56
*  And so on...

**4.  Continue until you reach 36 months.**

This can be a bit tedious to calculate manually.  You can use a financial calculator or a spreadsheet program to make the calculation easier. 

**Using the formula for compound interest:**

The general formula for compound interest is:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:

* A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest
* P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
* r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)
* n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year
* t = the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for

In this case:

* P = $20
* r = 0.20 (20% as a decimal)
* n = 6 (since the interest is compounded every two months)
* t = 3 (36 months / 12 months per year = 3 years)

Plugging these values into the formula:

A = 20 (1 + 0.20/6)^(6*3) 
A = 20 (1 + 0.0333)^18
A ≈ $39.94

* **Let 'x' represent the number of white carnations.**

* **Red roses:** Sandra ordered 4 times the white carnations, so she ordered 4x red roses.

* **Pink calla lilies:**  She ordered 5 times the number of white carnations, meaning she ordered 5x pink calla lilies.

* **We know she ordered 200 pink calla lilies, so 5x = 200**

* **Solving for x:** Divide both sides of the equation by 5: x = 40 white carnations.

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Equation 2 (Chickens):** w = r + 2 (There are two more white chickens than red chickens)

Now we can use substitution to solve for 'r':

1. **Substitute 'r + 2' for 'w' in Equation 1:** 
   3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

2. **Simplify and solve for 'r':**

"Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the cost of the gumballs:** 40 gumballs * $0.05/gumball = $2.00

2. **Determine the amount of change Billy had before buying gumballs:** Since he spent half his change on gumballs, he had $2.00 * 2 = $4.00 in change.

3. **Calculate the cost of the candy:**  Billy started with $10.00 and had $4.00 in change, so the candy cost $10.00 - $4.00 = $6.00

4. **Determine the number of pounds of candy:**  The candy cost $1.50 per pound, and he spent $6.00, so he bought $6.00 / $1.50/pound = 4 pounds of candy.

"Let's break this problem down:

* Let Carver's son's age be represented by the variable ""x"".

* Twice the age of his son is 2x.

* Five years less than twice his son's age is 2x - 5.

* We know this expression equals Carver's age, which is 45.  

So, we have the equation: 2x - 5 = 45

To solve for x:

1. Add 5 to both sides of the equation: 2x = 50
2. Divide both sides by 2: x = 25

**1. Find the price of the jogger jeans:**

* The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so they cost $28 - $6 = $22.

**2.  Figure out the savings on the jogger jeans:**

* Let 'x' represent the original price of the jogger jeans.
* Cole saved 1/3 of the savings on the jogger jeans, so he saved (1/3) * (x - $22).

**3.  Determine the savings on the tattered jeans:**

* Cole saved a total of $6, and (1/3) * (x - $22) of that came from the jogger jeans.
* Therefore, he saved $6 - (1/3) * (x - $22) on the tattered jeans.

**4. Set up an equation to represent the savings on the tattered jeans:**

* We know the tattered jeans originally cost $28 and he saved some amount.  Let's represent the original price of the tattered jeans as 'y'.
* The equation for the savings on the tattered jeans is: $28 - y = $6 - (1/3) * (x - $22)

**5. Solve for x (the original price of the jogger jeans):**

*  We need more information to solve for 'x'.  The problem doesn't give us enough information to determine the original price of the tattered jeans ('y') or solve for 'x'.

**1. Figure out how much money Kenny made from selling cards:**

* He had $50 in spending cash, and the amusement park ticket cost $100, so he made $100 - $50 = $50 from selling cards.

**2. Calculate the number of cards sold:**

* He sold each card for $1.50, and made $50, so he sold $50 / $1.50 = 33.33 cards.

**3. Determine the total number of cards:**

* He kept 1/3 of his cards, meaning the 33.33 cards sold represent 2/3 of his collection.
* Let 'x' be the total number of cards.  We can set up the equation: (2/3)x = 33.33
* To solve for x, multiply both sides by (3/2): x = 33.33 * (3/2)

"First, let's convert the length from yards to feet. There are 3 feet in every yard, so the length of Billie's room is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

Now we can use the area and length to find the width of the room.  Area of a rectangle is length times width, so the width is 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.

Finally, the perimeter of a rectangle is twice the length plus twice the width: 2 * 9 feet + 2 * 40 feet = 18 feet + 80 feet = 98 feet.

* Let 'c' represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats.

* Matt gets half the number of cookies as carrot sticks: c / 2
* He also gets 2 extra cookies for cleaning his room.

*  Let 'y' represent the number of 2 x 8 pieces of wood.

**2. Formulate the Objective Function:**

* Frederick wants to maximize the number of popsicle sticks.  
* The objective function is: 200x + 400y  (total sticks)

**3.  Set up the Constraints:**

* **Budget Constraint:** 4x + 6y ≤ 24 (The cost of wood cannot exceed $24)
* **Non-negativity Constraints:** x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (You can't buy negative pieces of wood)

**4. Solve the Linear Program:**

This is a classic linear programming problem. You can solve it graphically or using a solver.  Here's a graphical approach:

* **Graph the Constraints:** Plot the budget constraint (4x + 6y = 24) and the non-negativity constraints (x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0). The feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied.
* **Find the Corner Points:** Identify the corner points of the feasible region.
* **Evaluate the Objective Function:**  Calculate the value of the objective function (200x + 400y) at each corner point.
* **Select the Optimal Solution:** The corner point that yields the highest value for the objective function is the optimal solution.

**5.  Answer:**

After performing the graphical solution, you'll find the optimal solution and the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make.

"Here's how to calculate the total cost of John's research:

* **Months of research:** 5 months * 10 = 50 months
* **Funding increase:**  Each month after the first 5, the funding increases by 50%.
* **Calculating monthly funding:**
    * Month 6: $100,000 * 1.50 = $150,000
    * Month 7: $150,000 * 1.50 = $225,000
    * And so on...

This forms a geometric sequence.  We can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series to find the total cost:

S = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

Where:

* S = the sum of the series (total cost)
* a = the first term ($100,000)
* r = the common ratio (1.50)
* n = the number of terms (45 months - 5 initial months = 40 months)

Plugging in the values:

S = $100,000 (1 - 1.50^40) / (1 - 1.50)

Calculating this will give you the total cost of John's research.

"Let's break down this problem step by step:

**Let:**

*  *x* = the number of enemies Emma jumps on

*  *y* = the number of berries Emma collects

**Ava's Scores:**

* Enemies: *x + 8*
* Berries: *y + 3*
* Time: *timer - 4*

**Emma's Scores:**

* Enemies: *x*
* Berries: *y*
* Time: *timer*

**Setting up the equations:**

* Ava's score: 10(x + 8) + 5(y + 3) + 30(timer - 4)
* Emma's score: 10x + 5y + 30timer

**Finding the difference:**

To find the difference in their scores, we subtract Emma's score from Ava's score:

[10(x + 8) + 5(y + 3) + 30(timer - 4)] - [10x + 5y + 30timer]

**Simplifying the expression:**

10x + 80 + 5y + 15 + 30timer - 120 - 10x - 5y - 30timer = -15


**The difference between their scores is -15.**

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let 'w' represent the number of white fish Bob bought.**
* **Let 'o' represent the number of orange fish Bob bought.**

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish.
* **After purchase:** He has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This can be written as: 3 + o = 2(4 + w)
* **Total fish:** Bob bought 17 fish total, so o + w = 17

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:

1. **Simplify the first equation:** 3 + o = 8 + 2w
2. **Solve for 'o' in terms of 'w':** o = 5 + 2w
3. **Substitute this value of 'o' into the second equation:** (5 + 2w) + w = 17
4. **Combine like terms:** 5 + 3w = 17
5. **Subtract 5 from both sides:** 3w = 12
6. **Divide both sides by 3:** w = 4


**Answer:** Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

"Let's break this problem down using variables:

* Let your brother's age be ""b""
* Let your sister's age be ""s""
* Let your age be ""y""

Here's what we know:

*  y = b - 3  (You are three years younger than your brother)
*  y = s + 2  (You are two years older than your sister)
*  Mom's age = 3b - 1
*  y + b + s + (3b - 1) = 87 (The sum of all ages is 87)

Now we can use substitution to solve for ""y"" (your age):

1. **Substitute** the first two equations into the fourth equation:
   (b - 3) + b + (b - 3) + (3b - 1) = 87

2. **Simplify** the equation:
   6b - 7 = 87

3. **Add** 7 to both sides:
   6b = 94

4. **Divide** both sides by 6:
   b = 15.67 (approximately)

5. **Substitute** the value of ""b"" back into the equation y = b - 3:
   y = 15.67 - 3

6. **Calculate** ""y"":
   y = 12.67 (approximately)

* **Let 'x' represent the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn the first week.**

* **Kamala's lawn:** Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times.
* **Alba's lawn:** Tasha mowed Alba's lawn 5x times the second week.

* **Earnings from mowing:**
    * Joe: 1x * $6 = $6
    * Kamala: 3x * $6 = $18x
    * Alba: 5x * $6 = $30x
    * **Total mowing earnings:** $6 + $18x + $30x = $6 + $48x

* **Lemonade earnings:**  Since her total earnings were $80, we can set up the equation: $6 + $48x = $80

* **Solve for x:**
    * Subtract $6 from both sides: $48x = $74
    * Divide both sides by $48: x = 1.54 (approximately)

* **Calculate lemonade earnings:**
    * Lemonade earnings = Total earnings - Mowing earnings
    * Lemonade earnings = $80 - ($6 + $48 * 1.54) 
    * Lemonade earnings = $80 - $76.32
    * Lemonade earnings = $3.68

"Let's break this problem down:

* Let Peter's age be represented by 'P'
* Let Paul's age be represented by 'Pa'
* Let John's age be represented by 'J'

We are given the following information:

* P + Pa + J = 100  (The combined age of all three is 100)
* Pa = J + 10       (Paul is 10 years older than John)
* P = Pa + J        (Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's age)

Now we can use substitution to solve for Peter's age (P):

1. **Substitute** the second equation (Pa = J + 10) into the third equation: 
   P = (J + 10) + J
   P = 2J + 10

2. **Substitute** both the second equation (Pa = J + 10) and the modified third equation (P = 2J + 10) into the first equation:
   (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

3. **Simplify** and solve for J:
   4J + 20 = 100
   4J = 80
   J = 20

4. **Substitute** the value of J (20) back into the equation P = 2J + 10 to find Peter's age:
   P = (2 * 20) + 10
   P = 40 + 10
   P = 50

"Let's break this problem down:

* Let  'x' represent the number of points Dinar scored.
* Azibo scored 20 fewer points than Bahati, so Azibo scored 'x + 20' points.
* Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Bahati scored 'x + 10' points.

We know the total points are 45, so:

x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45

Combining like terms:

3x + 30 = 45

Subtracting 30 from both sides:

3x = 15

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 5

Since Azibo scored 'x + 20' points, Azibo scored 5 + 20 = 25 points.

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

* Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex caught.
* Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan caught.
* Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught.

Here's what we know from the problem:

*  A + S + W = 339  (Equation 1)
*  A = S + 5        (Equation 2)
*  S = 4W - 13      (Equation 3)

Now we can use substitution to solve for S (the number of Pokemon Stan caught):

1. **Substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1:**
   (S + 5) + S + W = 339

2. **Simplify:**
   2S + W = 334

3. **Substitute Equation 3 into the simplified equation:**
   2(4W - 13) + W = 334

4. **Simplify and solve for W:**
   8W - 26 + W = 334
   9W = 360
   W = 40

5. **Substitute the value of W back into Equation 3 to find S:**
   S = 4(40) - 13
   S = 160 - 13
   S = 147

"Here's how we can solve this problem by working backwards:

* **Step 1:  After the 3 hours of 7% loss:** The power bank had 28% + 7% * 3 = 49% charge.

* **Step 2: Before the 7% loss period:**  To find the charge before the 3 hours, we need to reverse the 7% loss.  Let 'x' be the charge before the 3 hours.  We have the equation: x * (1 - 0.07) = 49%  
   Solving for x: x = 49% / (1 - 0.07) = 52.8% (approximately)

* **Step 3: After the 5 hours of 9% loss:** The power bank had 52.8% + 9% * 5 = 77.8% charge.

* **Step 4: Initial charge:** This 77.8% represents the charge when Maria left for the park.

**2. Determine the total savings needed:**

*  We need to know how much Lauren needs to save to generate $40,000 per year in retirement. This depends on the assumed rate of return on her investments.  Let's assume a conservative rate of return of 4%. 
* Using the 4% rule of thumb, Lauren would need a retirement nest egg of $40,000 / 0.04 = $1,000,000.

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'K' represent the number of paintings Kim has.
    * Let 'S' represent the number of paintings Shelley has.
    * Let 'M' represent the number of paintings Samantha has.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * M = S - 12  (Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley)
    * S = K + 8   (Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim)
    * M = 27      (Samantha has 27 paintings)

* **Solve for K (the number of paintings Kim has):**

    1. **Substitute the value of M (27) into the first equation:** 
       27 = S - 12

    2. **Solve for S:**
       S = 27 + 12

* Blueberry cubes are 5 times the strawberry cubes minus 4, so that's 5s - 4.

* Divide both sides by 6: s = 20

Now that we know Mary made 20 strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes:

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the time Vanessa takes to run one mile.

**2. Set Up Equations:**

* Aaron's time per mile: x/2 (since he runs twice as fast as Vanessa)
* Aaron's total time: (x/2) * (Vanessa's distance) = 16 minutes
* Vanessa's total time: x * Vanessa's distance = Total time

**3.  Substitute and Solve:**

* We know Vanessa ran 4 miles, so:
    * Aaron's total time: (x/2) * 4 = 16
    * Simplifying: 2x = 16
    * Solving for x: x = 8 minutes (Vanessa's time per mile)

"Let... 

*  'c' represent the number of chickens
*  'w' represent the number of cows

Here's how we can set up the system of equations:

* **Equation 1 (Total animals):** c + w = 20 
* **Equation 2 (Total legs):** 2c + 4w = 70 (chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

Now we can solve for 'c' (the number of chickens).  One way to do this is using substitution:

1. **Solve Equation 1 for 'w':**  w = 20 - c

2. **Substitute this value of 'w' into Equation 2:** 2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 'c':** 2c + 80 - 4c = 70  =>  -2c = -10  =>  c = 5
