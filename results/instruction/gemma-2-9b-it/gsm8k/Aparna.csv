1. **Jamal's apples:** Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

2. **Jamal's bananas:** Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so he has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

3. **Andrea's bananas:** Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, meaning she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

* r = 6s  (Ruby is 6 times older than Sam)
* r + 9 = 3(s + 9) (In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam)

Now we can use substitution to solve for 's':

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Cooling:** Shannon cools the coffee by 65 degrees, and each ice cube cools it by 13 degrees. So she used 65 / 13 = 5 ice cubes.
* **Dilution from ice:** Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 ml weaker, and she used 5 ice cubes, so the coffee is 5 * 12 = 60 ml weaker from the ice.
* **Dilution from cream:** She adds 15 ml of cream, making the coffee 15 ml weaker.
* **Total weakening:** The total weakening is 60 ml (from ice) + 15 ml (from cream) = 75 ml.

**1. Understand the Ratio:**

The ratio 5:6 means that for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.

**2.  Find the Unit Value:**

*  Add the ratio parts: 5 + 6 = 11
*  Divide the total popsicles by the sum of the ratio parts: 165 / 11 = 15. This means each ""part"" of the ratio represents 15 popsicles.

**3. Calculate the Number of Popsicles:**

* **Solve for B (Bodhi's insects):**

"Let's break this problem down:

* Let 'x' represent the cost of the lot.
* The house cost three times the lot, so the house cost 3x.

* Together, the lot and house cost $120,000:  x + 3x = $120,000

* Combine like terms: 4x = $120,000

* Divide both sides by 4 to find the cost of the lot: x = $30,000

* Multiply the cost of the lot by 3 to find the cost of the house: 3 * $30,000 = $90,000

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let your brother's age be ""b""
    *  Let your sister's age be ""s""
    *  Let your age be ""a""

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  a = b - 3  (You are 3 years younger than your brother)
    *  a = s + 2   (You are 2 years older than your sister)
    *  Mom's age = 3b - 1
    *  a + b + s + (3b - 1) = 87 (The sum of all ages is 87)

* **Solve for 'a' (your age):**

   1. **Simplify the last equation:** a + 4b + s = 88
   2. **Substitute the values of 'a' from the first two equations into the simplified last equation:** (b - 3) + 4b + (a - 2) = 88
   3. **Combine like terms:** 5b + a - 5 = 88
   4. **Substitute 'a' again:** 5b + (b - 3) - 5 = 88
   5. **Simplify and solve for 'b':** 6b - 8 = 88  =>  6b = 96  =>  b = 16
   6. **Substitute the value of 'b' back into the equation a = b - 3 to find 'a':** a = 16 - 3  =>  a = 13

"Let's break this problem down:

* Let John's age be represented by ""J""
* Paul's age is 10 years older than John, so Paul's age is ""J + 10""
* Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's ages, so Peter's age is ""J + (J + 10)"" which simplifies to ""2J + 10""

* The combined age of all three is 100: J + (J + 10) + (2J + 10) = 100

Now we can solve for J:

* 4J = 80
* J = 20

Now that we know John's age (J = 20), we can find Peter's age:

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let 'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.**

* **The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so it's y - 7 centimeters long.**

* **The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, making it 4(y - 7) centimeters long.**

* **The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters: y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37**

Now we can solve for 'y':

1. **Simplify the equation:** y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
2. **Combine like terms:** 6y - 35 = 37
3. **Add 35 to both sides:** 6y = 72
4. **Divide both sides by 6:** y = 12

Now that we know the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long, we can find the length of the red rope:

* **Red rope length:** 4(y - 7) = 4(12 - 7) = 4(5) = 20
