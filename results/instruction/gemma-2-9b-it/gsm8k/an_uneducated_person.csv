"Okay, so the house went up in value by 150%, that means it's worth 150% more than it was before.

First, we gotta figure out how much more it's worth: $80,000 times 150% is... well, that's a lot!  Let's see, 150% is the same as 1.5, so... $80,000 times 1.5 is $120,000.

So the house is now worth $120,000.

He spent $50,000 fixing it up, so he made $120,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $0.

"Okay, so he buys 16 glasses.  

Every other one is cheaper, so let's think about it like this:

* He buys 1 glass at $5.
* Then he buys 1 cheaper glass at $5 x 0.60 = $3.
* Then another $5 glass, and another $3 glass... and so on.

That means he buys 8 glasses at $5 and 8 glasses at $3.

So, he pays 8 x $5 = $40 for the first 8.

And he pays 8 x $3 = $24 for the other 8.

That's a total of $40 + $24 = $64

That means for the first part, she downloads 200 GB times 40% which is 80 GB.

At 2 GB a minute, that takes 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

Then she has to restart and download the whole thing again, so that's another 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.

* **Turning around:**  He goes back the same distance, so now he's 180 miles from home.
* **Traffic:** He's stuck for 2 hours, so he doesn't move any closer to home.
* **Slow drive:** He drives 0.5 hours at 30 mph, which is 0.5 * 30 = 15 miles.
* **Fast drive:** He has 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours left to drive at 80 mph. That's 1.5 * 80 = 120 miles.

* **Total distance:** He's 180 miles away, then goes 15 miles closer, then 120 miles further away. So he's 180 - 15 + 120 = 285 miles from home.

* **Green House:** She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, meaning the 12 vacuum cleaners represent two-thirds of her total.
* **Start:** To find the original number, we need to figure out what one-third is. If 12 is two-thirds, then one-third is 12 / 2 = 6.  So she started with 6 * 3 = 18 vacuum cleaners.

So, 16 students - 4 students = 12 students are in hip-hop.

That means 12 students out of 20 is 12/20, which is 0.60.

* The top level is 16 square feet.
* The level below that must be twice as big, so 16 times 2 is 32 square feet.
* The level below that is twice as big as 32, so 32 times 2 is 64 square feet.
* And the bottom level is twice as big as 64, so 64 times 2 is 128 square feet.

Now, to find the average, we add up all the sizes: 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet.

Then we divide that by how many levels there are: 240 / 4 = 60 square feet.

That means she spent a total of $100 + $80 = $180 on the lumber.

Now, the prices went up 50%, so she can sell the 2x4s for $10 times 1.50 which is $15 each.

And the 4x4s she can sell for $16 times 1.50 which is $24 each.

So, she can sell the 2x4s for 10 times $15 which is $150.

Four years ago, Adrien made 30% more than Lylah, so we need to figure out what Lylah made then.  Let's say Lylah made $x.  Then Adrien made $1.30x.

We know $1.30x = $40,000, so Lylah made $40,000 / 1.30 = $30,769.23 (rounded to the nearest cent).

Now, their salaries both went up by the same amount of time, so Lylah's salary is also up by 40%. That's $30,769.23 * 0.40 = $12,307.69 more.

So now Lylah makes $30,769.23 + $12,307.69 = $43,076.92.

Now, there are 16 weeks in a semester, so he goes to class 7 hours a day * 5 days a week = 35 hours a week.

* **Before, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.**  That means when the big pool lost water, it lost twice as much as the small pool.

* **Now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.**

This means the big pool lost more water than the small pool, but not four times as much.  

It's tricky, but I can't figure out how much water is in the small pool now.

"Okay, so mini-golf is $5 a person, and she wants to do that with her friends.  Let's see...

She has $90 and wants to spend $5 on mini-golf for herself and her friends.  That means she has $90 - $5 = $85 left.

Then she wants $5 for arcade tokens for everyone, so that's $85 - $5 = $80 left.

The go-karts cost $10 each ride, and she wants to ride twice, so that's $10 x 2 = $20 per person.

That means she has $80 - $20 = $60 left for her friends.

Since each friend costs $5 for mini-golf, she can invite $60 / $5 = 12 friends.

"Let's see...

The first place costs $200 no matter what, but then you gotta add $5 for each person who comes for food.

The second place costs $25 per person, and that includes food.

To figure out when they cost the same, we need to find out how many people it takes for the food cost at the first place to be the same as the price at the second place.

So, we gotta figure out when $25 times the number of people is the same as $200 plus $5 times the number of people.

That's a bit tricky...  

Let me think...


 25 * number of people = 200 + 5 * number of people

 20 * number of people = 200

The shops want 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses each week.

"Let's see...

She takes out $100 each month, so in a year that's $100 times 12 months, which is $1200.

After a year, she'll have $3000 minus $1200, which is $1800 left.

Then, another year goes by and she takes out another $1200, so $1800 minus $1200 is $600.

"Okay, so they spend $3.00 on bread for 10 sandwiches.

And they spend $30.00 on cheese and stuff for 10 sandwiches too.

They sell the 10 sandwiches for $70.00.

So they make $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

"Okay, so the oven is hotter than what it says.  

It's hotter by 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.

That means it's off by 18/450 = 0.04 times, or 4% hotter.

So, to get 520 degrees, we gotta figure out what number to set it to so that 4% hotter is 520.

Let's say the number is 'x'.  We know:

x * 1.04 = 520

To get x by itself, we divide both sides by 1.04:

x = 520 / 1.04

30% of $76,000 is $22,800.

So Juan's house cost $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

"Okay, so the vaccines cost $20 each times 2, that's $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the whole bill, so let's figure out what the whole bill is.

The vaccines are $40, and the heartworm check is some amount, so the whole bill is $40 plus that amount.

We know the heartworm check is 60% of the whole bill, so we can write that as an equation: 0.60 * ( $40 + heartworm check) = heartworm check

Let's solve for the heartworm check.

The whole bill is $40 plus the heartworm check, so we can write that as: $40 + heartworm check = total bill

Now we can plug that into our equation: 0.60 * (total bill) = heartworm check

We know the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so we can write that as: 0.60 * total bill = heartworm check

Now we can solve for the total bill: total bill = heartworm check / 0.60

We know the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so we can write that as: heartworm check = 0.60 * total bill

Now we can plug that into our equation: 0.60 * total bill = 0.60 * total bill

This means the total bill is equal to the heartworm check.

So the total bill is $40 plus the heartworm check, and the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill.

Let's solve for the total bill:

total bill = $40 + heartworm check

total bill = $40 + 0.60 * total bill

0.40 * total bill = $40

total bill = $40 / 0.40

total bill = $100

So the total bill is $100.

John brought $125 and the bill was $100, so he leaves with $25.

That's a lot of pizza!  

Now, they started with 5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices.

Hannah breaks a quarter of the student car windows, so she breaks 256 divided by 4, which is 64 student car windows.

* **Subtract to find their hiking speed:** 25 miles per hour - 5 miles per hour = 20 miles per hour.
* **Calculate the distance hiked:** 20 miles per hour * 1.5 hours = 30 miles.
* **Calculate the distance driven:** 50 miles per hour * (6 hours - 1.5 hours) = 225 miles.
* **Add the distances:** 225 miles + 30 miles = 255 miles.

"Okay, so Ava is better at jumpin' on the bad guys, she gets 8 more points for that.  And she finds 3 more berries, so that's 15 more points.  But Emma finishes faster, so she gets 12 more points for that.  

Let's see... 8 enemies times 10 points is 80 points.  And 3 berries times 5 points is 15 points.  That's 95 points for Ava.  Emma gets 12 points for the timer, so she gets 12 points less than Ava.

If you take away the 10 minute break, that leaves 110 minutes.

110 minutes divided by 10 minutes per group is 11 groups.

"Let's see... she puts in $300 and it grows by three-quarters of that each year.

So, the first year it grows by $300 * (3/4) = $225

That means she has $300 + $225 = $525

The next year, it grows by $225 * (3/4) = $168.75

Now she has $525 + $168.75 = $693.75

And the last year, it grows by $168.75 * (3/4) = $126.56

So, in total, she'll have $693.75 + $126.56 = $820.31

* **Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, so she is '3b - 1' years old.**

* **Now, let's add up everyone's ages: b + (b - 3) + (b - 5) + (3b - 1) = 87**

* **Combine like terms: 6b - 9 = 87**

* **Add 9 to both sides: 6b = 96**

"Let's think about this step by step:

* **Blue rope:** We don't know how long the blue rope is, but we know it's 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.

* **Yellow rope:** We don't know how long the yellow rope is either.

* **Red rope:** We know the red rope is four times longer than the blue rope.

* **All together:**  We know all three ropes together are 37 centimeters long.

This is a bit tricky!  I can't figure out how long the red rope is without knowing how long the yellow rope is.

"Rissa got 5 times 3 which is 15 dollars.

Rissa gave away 15 / 5 = 3 dollars.

Ronnie gave away 5 / 5 = 1 dollar.

Rissa has 15 - 3 = 12 dollars left.

Ronnie has 5 - 1 = 4 dollars left.

"Here's how to solve it:

* Half the mural is yellow, so that's 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints of yellow paint.
* Red, white, and purple make up the other half, so that's 12 pints - 6 pints = 6 pints total.
* Since they are equal amounts, each color (red, white, purple) used 6 pints / 3 = 2 pints.

"Here's how to figure that out:

* **Bedroom size:** Each bedroom is 20 feet * 12 feet = 240 square feet.
* **Living room size:** The living room is 240 square feet * 5 = 1200 square feet.
* **Total bedroom area:** All the bedrooms together are 240 square feet/bedroom * 4 bedrooms = 960 square feet.
* **Total house area:** That's 960 square feet (bedrooms) + 1200 square feet (living room) + 1000 square feet (rest) = 3160 square feet.

"Let's see...

If the bigger box has 20% more pods, that means it has 100 + (20% of 100) pods. 20% of 100 is 20, so the bigger box has 120 pods.

That means for $1, you can run 120 dishwashing cycles.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

* **Start with the total bills:** Thomas gets 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.
* **Bills lost:** He loses 10 bills, leaving him with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.
* **Bills used:** He uses 40 / 2 = 20 bills to pay the bill.
* **Bills remaining:** He has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.
* **Tripling his money:** He triples his money, so he has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.
* **Converting to 5 dollar bills:** He converts to 5 dollar bills, so he has 60 * 5 = 300 five dollar bills.

"Team B scored 2 less than team A in the first half, so they scored 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scored 4 times the amount from the first half, so they scored 2 * 4 = 8 goals.

Team A scored 1/4 the amount team B scored in the second half, so they scored 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

In total, team A scored 4 + 2 = 6 goals in the match.

Team B scored 2 + 8 = 10 goals in the match.

All together, they scored 6 + 10 = 16 goals.

"Here's how to figure that out:

* **Chalk left:** If he used 45% of the chalk, he has 100% - 45% = 55% left.
* **Chalk in inches:** 5 inches * 55% = 2.75 inches of chalk left.
* **Days of use:** He uses 20% each day, so 2.75 inches / 20% = 13.75 days.

"Okay, so there are 12 girls and 12 boys, that's 24 kids in all.

One-third of the girls is 12 / 3 = 4 girls.

One-fourth of the boys is 12 / 4 = 3 boys.

So, 4 girls + 3 boys = 7 kids are on varsity.

That means 24 - 7 = 17 kids are not on varsity.

"Okay, so he bought 4000 gallons of milk at $3.50 a gallon. That's 4000 times 3.50, which is 14,000 dollars.

He got 1600 gallons back, and each gallon cost $3.50, so he got 1600 times 3.50 back.

That's 5600 dollars.

"Let's break this down:

* Let Wendy's current age be ""W""
* Let Colin's current age be ""C""

Here's what we know:

* **In seven years:** Colin will be C + 7 years old, and Wendy will be W years old. We know Wendy will be five times as old as Colin then:  W = 5(C + 7)
* **In 25 years:** Colin will be C + 25 years old, and Wendy will be W + 25 years old. We know Colin will be a third as old as Wendy then: C + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns.  Let's use substitution to make things easier.

Since we know W = 5(C + 7), let's plug that into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7) + 25)

Now we can solve for C. It'll take a bit of algebra, but we can get there! 


Let me know if you want me to work through the algebra steps.

"He can buy a lot of books!  

Let's see, he has $27,000 and each 100 books cost $500.  So he can buy $27,000 / $500 = 54 sets of books.

That means he can buy 54 * 100 = 5400 books in total.

Since he's buying for 3 schools, he can buy 5400 / 3 = 1800 books per school.

"Okay, so Jay makes 20 snowballs every hour.  That's a lot!

But, he loses 2 every 15 minutes.  That means he loses 4 every hour 'cause there are two 15 minutes in an hour.

To get 60 snowballs, he needs to make 60 / 16 = 3.75 hours.

To find out how much more she makes, we gotta figure out how much she sells them for and then subtract what she paid.

"Okay, so the manicure is $35 and the pedicure is $40.  That's $35 + $40 = $75 together.

But they give you 20% off if you do both, so that's like taking $75 times 0.20, which is $15 off.

Then she wants nail art on each finger, and let's say she has 10 fingers. That's 10 fingers times $3 each, so that's $30 more.

Over three days, he drives 1200 times 3, which is 3600 kilometers.

Now, to find out what percentage of 6000 kilometers that is, we can do some dividing. 3600 divided by 6000 is 0.6.

To turn that into a percentage, we multiply by 100, so 0.6 times 100 is 60.

Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so she raised $300 + $400 = $700.

To find the total, we add up what everyone raised: $430 + $750 + $700 = $1880.

"Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, so Aaron ran 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.

Aaron ran his 2 miles in 16 minutes, so he runs 1 mile in 16 minutes / 2 miles = 8 minutes.

Vanessa runs 1 mile in 8 minutes * 2 = 16 minutes.

Vanessa ran 4 miles, so it took her 16 minutes/mile * 4 miles = 64 minutes.

"He needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and he has 200 feet of dock. So he needs 3 times 200 feet of line, which is 600 feet.

He already has 6 feet, so he needs to buy 600 - 6 = 594 feet of line.

"Here's how to figure that out:

* **Cost per reservation:** 2 meals * $5/meal + $5 wine = $15
* **Money made per night:** 6 reservations * $15/reservation = $90
* **Money made per week:** $90/night * 2 nights/week = $180

"Okay, so he made 25% more money than he spent.  

He made a profit of $80 times 0.25, which is $20.

That means he sold all the watermelons for $80 plus $20, which is $100.

So each watermelon sold for $100 divided by 50, which is $2.

"Here's how to solve this:

* Dora is 12 - 3 = 9 years old now.
* James is 9 * 2 = 18 years old now.
* John's youngest son is 32 - 19 = 13 years younger than James.
* In 3 years, the youngest son will be 18 - 13 + 3 = 8 years old.

"Let's see...

Ana peels one orange every 3 minutes.  So in an hour (60 minutes) she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane peels one orange every 4 minutes. So in an hour, she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

Ana peels 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane.

"Okay, so the radiator cost $400 but he got it for 80% off, so he saved $400 * 0.80 = $320.

That means he paid $400 - $320 = $80 for the radiator.

The mechanic charged $50 an hour for 3 hours, so that's $50 * 3 = $150.

To find the total cost, we add the price of the radiator and the mechanic's labor: $80 + $150 = $230.

"Here's how to solve this:

* Cows have 4 legs, chickens have 2.
* Let's say there are 'c' chickens and 'w' cows.
* We know c + w = 20 (total animals)
* We also know 2c + 4w = 70 (total legs)

Now we need to figure out how many chickens there are.  That's 'c'.  

Let me think...

"Okay, so there's Henry and 3 friends, that's 4 people in all.

They got 7 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices, so that's 7 times 8, which is 56 slices.

Now we gotta split 56 slices between 4 people.  

56 divided by 4 is 14.
