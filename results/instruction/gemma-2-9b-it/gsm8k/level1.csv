* **Solve for B (Bodhi's insects):** 
    * Substitute the second equation into the first equation: (D + 7) + D + B = 43
    * Substitute the third equation into the above equation: (B/2) + 7 + (B/2) + B = 43

    * Month 7: $150,000 * 1.50 = $225,000
    * ... and so on for 45 more months.

* **Summing the funding:** This requires the formula for the sum of a geometric series:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of large buttons from small stickers**

* Lorraine trades 90% of her 30 small stickers: 0.90 * 30 = 27 small stickers
* Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of large stickers remaining**

* Lorraine trades 50% of her 40 large stickers: 0.50 * 40 = 20 large stickers

**Step 3: Calculate the number of small stickers received from trading large stickers**

*  She trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small stickers: 20 large stickers * 3 small stickers/large sticker = 60 small stickers

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of buttons**

*  Total large buttons: 9 (from small stickers) + 20 (from trading large stickers) = 29 large buttons
*  Total small buttons: 60 (from trading large stickers) 

**Step 5: Convert small buttons to large buttons**

*  Total small buttons can be converted to large buttons: 60 small buttons / 3 small buttons/large button = 20 large buttons

**Step 6: Calculate the final total of buttons**

*  Total large buttons: 29 + 20 = 49 large buttons

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Let:**

*  *w* = the number of white fish Bob bought
*  *o* = the number of orange fish Bob bought

**Set up the equations:**

*  *o + w* = 17 (The total number of fish Bob bought)
*  *3 + o = 2(3 + w)* (Twice as many orange fish as white after buying more)

**Solve for *w*:**

1. **Simplify the second equation:** 
   3 + o = 6 + 2w

2. **Solve for *o* in terms of *w*:**
   o = 3 + 2w

3. **Substitute this value of *o* into the first equation:**
   (3 + 2w) + w = 17

4. **Combine like terms:**
   3 + 3w = 17

5. **Subtract 3 from both sides:**
   3w = 14

6. **Divide both sides by 3:**
   w = 4.67


Since Bob can't buy parts of fish, we round down to the nearest whole number.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let 'x' represent the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) in ounces.**

* **Salt and sugar are equal, so they are also 'x' ounces each.**

* **Oil is twice the amount of salt, so she uses 2*x ounces of oil.**

Since the total weight of the scrub is 10 ounces, we can set up an equation:

x + x + x + 2x = 10

Combining like terms:

5x = 10

Solving for x:

x = 2

Now that we know x = 2, we can find the amount of oil:

Oil = 2 * x = 2 * 2 = 4

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of cards PJ has.**

* **Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.**

* **Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.**

"Let's break down this problem:

* Let Peter's age be represented by 'P'
* Let Paul's age be represented by 'Pa'
* Let John's age be represented by 'J'

We know:

* P + Pa + J = 100  (The combined age of all three)
* Pa = J + 10       (Paul is 10 years older than John)
* P = Pa + J        (Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's ages)

Now we can use substitution to solve for Peter's age (P):

1. **Substitute 'J + 10' for 'Pa' in the third equation:** 
   P = (J + 10) + J
   P = 2J + 10

2. **Substitute 'J + 10' for 'Pa' in the first equation:**
   (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

3. **Simplify and solve for J:**
   4J + 20 = 100
   4J = 80
   J = 20

4. **Substitute the value of J (20) back into the equation for P:**

"Let's break this problem down:

* Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar, so Bahati's score is 'd + 10'.
* Azibo scored 20 less than Bahati, so Azibo's score is '(d + 10) - 20' which simplifies to 'd - 10'.

* The total score is 45, so  d + (d + 10) + (d - 10) = 45

* Combining like terms, we get 3d = 45

* Dividing both sides by 3, we find d = 15.

* Azibo scored d - 10, so Azibo's score is 15 - 10 = 5.

"Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the charge lost in the first 5 hours:**

* The power bank lost 9% of its capacity per hour for 5 hours, so it lost 9 * 5 = 45% of its capacity.

**2. Calculate the charge remaining after the first 5 hours:**

*  Let 'x' be the initial charge of the power bank.
* After 5 hours, the remaining charge is x - 0.45x = 0.55x

**3. Calculate the charge lost in the next 3 hours:**

* The power bank lost 7% of its capacity per hour for 3 hours, so it lost 7 * 3 = 21% of its capacity.

**4.  Set up an equation to represent the final charge:**

* The final charge is 28%, which is equal to the remaining charge after 5 hours minus the charge lost in the next 3 hours: 0.55x - 0.21x = 0.28

**5. Solve for x:**

* Combine like terms: 0.34x = 0.28

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline painted each.**

* **Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs together, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah.  Let 'y' represent the number of eggs Sarah painted. This means Camden painted 'y + 12' eggs.**

* **We know the total eggs painted is 56: x + x + y + (y + 12) = 56**

* **Simplify the equation: 2x + 2y + 12 = 56**

* **Further simplification: 2x + 2y = 44**

* **Divide both sides by 2: x + y = 22**

* **We also know Camden painted y + 12 eggs.**

* **To find the difference between Camden's eggs and Arnold's eggs, we need to find 'x'.  We can use the equation x + y = 22 and the fact that Camden painted y + 12 eggs.**

* **Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to solve for 'x' directly.  There are multiple combinations of 'x' and 'y' that would satisfy the equations.**

"Let's break this problem down:

* **The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so it is 'y - 7' centimeters long.**

* **The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so it is 4 * (y - 7) centimeters long.**

* **The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters: y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37**

Now we can solve for 'y':

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

**Let's use variables:**

* Let Wendy's current age be ""w""
* Let Colin's current age be ""c""

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now"":  w = 5(c + 7) 
*  ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now"": c + 25 = (1/3)w

**Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:**

1. **Solve for 'w' in the first equation:**
   w = 5c + 35

2. **Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:**
   c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

3. **Simplify and solve for 'c':**
   3c + 75 = 5c + 35
   40 = 2c
   c = 20

"Let's break this problem down:

* Let 's' represent the number of strawberry cubes.
* Blueberry cubes are 5 times the strawberry cubes minus 4: 5s - 4
* Total ice cubes are strawberry cubes plus blueberry cubes: s + (5s - 4) = 116

Now we can solve for 's':

* Combine like terms: 6s - 4 = 116
* Add 4 to both sides: 6s = 120
* Divide both sides by 6: s = 20

Finally, find the number of blueberry cubes:

* 5s - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Dora's current age:** Since Dora will be 12 in 3 years, she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.
* **James's current age:** James is twice Dora's age, so he is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.
* **John's youngest son's current age:** John was 32 when his youngest son was born, and he is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.  Therefore, his youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old.
* **John's youngest son's age in 3 years:** In 3 years, his youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of chickens and 'w' represent the number of cows.**

* **We know:**
    * c + w = 20 (total animals)
    * 2c + 4w = 70 (total legs)

* **Solve for 'c' (number of chickens):**

One way to solve this is using substitution:

1. Solve the first equation for 'w': 
   w = 20 - c

2. Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:
   2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

3. Simplify and solve for 'c':
   2c + 80 - 4c = 70
   -2c = -10
   c = 5
