"First, we need to figure out how much the house was worth after the repairs.  

The house increased in value by 150%, so that means it's now 150% more than the original $80,000.  

150% of $80,000 is (150/100) * $80,000 = $120,000

So the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

Now we need to figure out how much profit Josh made.  

He spent $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000 on the house.

He sold it for $200,000, so his profit is $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

"Let's solve this step by step:

* **Queens:**  First, we need to figure out how many queens there are.  Since there are twice as many babies as queens, let's say there are 'x' queens. That means there are 2*x babies.

* **Babies:** We know there are 700 bees total, so queens + babies + workers = 700.  So, x + 2x + workers = 700

* **Workers:** We also know there are twice as many workers as babies, so there are 2 * (2x) = 4x worker bees.

* **Putting it together:** Now we can write the equation: x + 2x + 4x = 700

* **Solving for x:**  That simplifies to 7x = 700.  To find x (the number of queens), we divide both sides by 7: x = 100

* **Finding the workers:** Since there are 4x worker bees, there are 4 * 100 = 400 worker bees.

"Let's think about this:

*  We have 200 students to split into 3 groups.
*  Two groups are the same size.
*  The smallest group has 10 fewer students than the bigger groups.

Let's use some numbers to help us:

*  Let's say the bigger groups have 'x' students each.
*  The smallest group has 'x - 10' students.

Now we can add up the number of students in all the groups:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

That's the same as:

3x - 10 = 200

To find out how many students are in each bigger group (x), we need to add 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Then, we divide both sides by 3:

x = 70

So, the bigger groups have 70 students each.

Finally, we can find the number of students in the smallest group:

70 - 10 = 60

"If one person takes 5 days to paint half a house, that means it takes 10 days for one person to paint the whole house.

If 5 people work together, they could paint the whole house in 2 days (10 days / 5 people = 2 days).

Since there are 24 hours in a day, it would take 48 hours for 5 people to paint the whole house (2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours).

"Let's say the smallest angle is 'x' degrees.

* The second angle is twice the smallest, so it's 2*x = 2x degrees.
* The third angle is three times the smallest, so it's 3*x = 3x degrees.

All the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, so:
x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms:
6x = 180

To find x, we divide both sides by 6:
x = 30

Now we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees.

"Here's how to solve this:

* Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs.
* Let's say there are 's' sheep and 'g' geese.

We know:

*  4s + 2g = 70 (for the legs)
*  s + g = 20 (for the heads)

We can solve for 's' (the number of sheep).  

Let's use the second equation to say g = 20 - s.

Now we can put that into the first equation:

4s + 2(20 - s) = 70

4s + 40 - 2s = 70

2s + 40 = 70

2s = 30

s = 15

"Let's solve this like a puzzle!

* Janey has 21 books.
* We know Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has.  
* Let's say Sally has ""S"" books.

So, twice the number of Sally's books is 2 * S = 2S

Janey has 2S + 3 books.

We know that 2S + 3 = 21

To find out how many books Sally has (S), we need to figure out what number, when multiplied by 2 and then added to 3, equals 21.

Let's try some numbers:

* If Sally has 5 books (S=5), then 2 * 5 + 3 = 13. That's not 21.
* If Sally has 8 books (S=8), then 2 * 8 + 3 = 19. Still not 21.
* If Sally has 9 books (S=9), then 2 * 9 + 3 = 21!

 
Sally has 9 books.

"First, let's change 8 feet and 4 inches to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 8 feet is 8 * 12 = 96 inches.  

That means Topher's shoe is 96 + 4 = 100 inches long.

Let's use ""b"" to stand for the length of one of Bobby's shoes.  

We know Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times Bobby's shoe, so we can write an equation:

9b + 10 = 100

To solve for ""b"", we need to get it by itself.  First, subtract 10 from both sides:

9b = 90

Then, divide both sides by 9:

Let's try some numbers! If he bought 9 orange fish, he would have 12 orange fish total (3 + 9 = 12). That means he bought 8 white fish (17 - 9 = 8).

* **Check if it works:** 12 orange fish is twice the number of 6 white fish (12 / 6 = 2).

* **She uses twice as much oil as salt, so she uses 2*y ounces of oil.**

* **She uses twice as much salt as zest, so y = 2*x**

* **All together, the jar is 10 ounces:** x + x + y + y + 2*y = 10

**Now we can solve for 'y':**

"Let's solve this problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use letters to represent the number of cards:**

    * Let 'P' be the number of cards PJ has.
    * Let 'S' be the number of cards Smendrick has.
    * Let 'B' be the number of cards Becca has.

* **Write down the information we know as equations:**

    * B = S + 12  (Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick)
    * S = 3P      (Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards PJ has)
    * B + S + P = 341 (The total number of cards is 341)

* **Now we can use these equations to find out how many cards Becca has:**

    1. **Substitute** the value of 'S' from the second equation into the first equation: 
       B = (3P) + 12

    2. **Substitute** the values of 'S' and 'B' from the equations above into the third equation:
       (3P) + 12 + 3P + P = 341

    3. **Simplify** the equation:
       7P + 12 = 341

    4. **Subtract** 12 from both sides:
       7P = 329

    5. **Divide** both sides by 7:
       P = 47  (This means PJ has 47 cards)

    6. **Substitute** the value of 'P' back into the equation S = 3P:
       S = 3 * 47 = 141 (This means Smendrick has 141 cards)

    7. **Substitute** the value of 'S' back into the equation B = S + 12:
       B = 141 + 12 = 153 (This means Becca has 153 cards)

"Let's think about this like a puzzle!

* We know Peter, Paul, and John's ages add up to 100.
* Paul is 10 years older than John.
* Peter's age is the same as Paul's age plus John's age.

If we let John's age be ""J"", then Paul's age is ""J + 10"".  Since Peter's age is Paul's age plus John's age, Peter is ""J + (J + 10)"" which is ""2J + 10"" years old.

Now we can write a sentence to show all their ages together: J + (J + 10) + (2J + 10) = 100

Let's solve for J:
* 4J + 20 = 100
* 4J = 80
* J = 20

So John is 20 years old.

Now we can find Paul's age:
* Paul = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 years old

Finally, we can find Peter's age:
* Peter = 2J + 10 = 2 * 20 + 10 = 50 years old



Peter is 50 years old.

"Here's how we can solve this:

* **Step 1:  Calculate the charge lost in the first 5 hours:**
   The power bank lost 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours, so it lost 9 * 5 = 45% of its charge.

* **Step 2: Calculate the charge remaining after the first 5 hours:**
   If the power bank started with 100% charge and lost 45%, it had 100 - 45 = 55% charge left.

* **Step 3: Calculate the charge lost in the next 3 hours:**
   The power bank lost 7% of its charge each hour for 3 hours, so it lost 7 * 3 = 21% of its charge.

* **Step 4: Calculate the final charge:**
   After losing 21% of the remaining 55%, the power bank had 55 - 21 = 34% charge left.

* **Step 5:  We know the final charge was 28%, so:**

"First, we need to find out how big Jim wants each piece of fabric to be.

The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide, so he wants each piece to be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

Now we can find the area of each piece of fabric: 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet.

"Bobby takes a 30 minute lunch each day, so in 5 days that's 30 minutes * 5 days = 150 minutes.

He also takes two 15 minute breaks each day, so that's 15 minutes * 2 breaks = 30 minutes per day.

Over 5 days, that's 30 minutes * 5 days = 150 minutes.

So in total, his lunches and breaks add up to 150 minutes + 150 minutes = 300 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 300 minutes is equal to 300 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 5 hours.

Think of it like this: if 40% is 240 boys, then 100% would be bigger.  

To find out how big 100% is, we can divide the number of boys by the percentage they represent: 240 boys / 40% = 600 students.

So, there are 600 students in the whole school.
