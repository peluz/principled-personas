*  We don't know Lylah's initial salary (L), but we know Adrien's salary four years later is 30% higher than hers.
* Let Lylah's salary four years later be represented by ""Y"".
*  We have the equation: 1.30L = Y * 0.70  (Since Adrien's salary four years later is 30% higher than Lylah's)

**4.  Solve for Lylah's salary four years later (Y):**

*  Y = (1.30L) / 0.70 
*  Y = 1.86L

**5. Calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later:**

* Total salary = Adrien's salary + Lylah's salary

* The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 = 50%.

**2. Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**

* There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die (2, 4, 6).
* The probability of rolling one even number is 3/6 = 1/2.
* Since the rolls are independent events, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 25%.

**3. The difference in probability:**

* The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 50% and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 25%.
* The difference is 50% - 25% = 25%.

* **Calculate straw given to rats:** 160 total pieces of straw - 50 pieces of straw (hamsters) = 110 pieces of straw
* **Calculate the number of rats:** 110 pieces of straw / 6 pieces of straw/rat = 18.33 rats
* **Since we can't have fractions of rats, we know there must be a slight error in the problem setup.**  It's impossible to have 18.33 rats in equal groups across 3 cages.

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'B' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
    * Let 'D' represent the number of insects David found.
    * Let 'L' represent the number of insects Lily found.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  L + D + B = 43  (Total insects)
    *  L = D + 7       (Lily found 7 more than David)
    *  D = B / 2        (David found half of what Bodhi found)

* **Solve for the variables:**

    1. **Substitute** the second and third equations into the first equation:
       (D + 7) + D + (D * 2) = 43

    2. **Simplify** the equation:
       4D + 7 = 43

       4D = 36

    4. **Divide** both sides by 4:
       D = 9

    5. **Now that you know D (David's insects), find L (Lily's insects):**
       L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Let's use variables:**

*  Let 't' represent the age of one triplet.
*  Let 'tw' represent the age of one twin.

**Set up the equations:**

* We know tw = t + 7 (The twin is 7 years older than the triplet)
* We also know tw + t + t + t = 44 (The combined ages of all three triplets and one twin)

**Solve for 't':**

* Simplify the second equation: tw + 3t = 44

**Substitute 't + 7' for 'tw' in the simplified equation:**

* (t + 7) + 3t = 44

**Combine like terms:**

* 4t + 7 = 44

**Subtract 7 from both sides:**

* 4t = 37

**Divide both sides by 4:**

* t = 9.25

**Find the age of the twin:**

* tw = t + 7 = 9.25 + 7 = 16.25

"Let's break down this problem step by step:

* **Let 'x' represent the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) in ounces.**

* **Salt and sugar are equal, so they are also 'x' ounces each.**

* **Oil is twice the amount of salt, so she uses 2*x ounces of oil.**

Since the total weight of the scrub is 10 ounces, we can set up an equation:

x + x + x + 2x = 10

Combining like terms:

5x = 10

Solving for x:

x = 2

Now that we know x = 2, we can find the amount of oil:

Oil = 2 * x = 2 * 2 = 4

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'F' represent the number of books Fawn has.
    * Let 'A' represent the number of books Anne has.
    * Let 'S' represent the number of books Sofie has.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * S + A + F = 85  (The total number of books)
    * S = A + 25      (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
    * A = F - 12      (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

* **Solve for F (the number of books Fawn has):**

    1. **Substitute** the values of S and A from the second and third equations into the first equation:
       (A + 25) + A + F = 85

    2. **Simplify** the equation:
       2A + F + 25 = 85

    3. **Substitute** the value of A from the third equation (A = F - 12) into the simplified equation:
       2(F - 12) + F + 25 = 85

    4. **Solve for F:**
       2F - 24 + F + 25 = 85
       3F + 1 = 85
       3F = 84
       F = 28

"Let's break this problem down:

* **Let John's age be represented by ""J""**
* **Paul's age is 10 years older than John, so Paul's age is ""J + 10""**
* **Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's ages, so Peter's age is ""J + (J + 10)"" which simplifies to ""2J + 10""**

* **The combined age of all three is 100: J + (J + 10) + (2J + 10) = 100**

Now we can solve for J:

* **4J + 20 = 100**
* **4J = 80**
* **J = 20**

Finally, we can find Peter's age:

* **Peter's age = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 50**

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let's represent Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time as ""x"".**

* **Bill's dad was 30 when he saw the comet, and Bill saw it again three times that age, meaning he was 3 * 30 = 90 years old.**

* **Since the comet returns every 75 years, the time between Bill's two sightings is 75 years.**

* **This means Bill's age when he saw it the second time (90) is 75 years more than his age when he saw it the first time (x).**

* **We can set up the equation: x + 75 = 90**

* **Solving for x: x = 90 - 75**

* **Therefore, x = 15**

   * Let 'y' represent the number of eggs Sarah painted.

2. **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   *  x + x + y + (y + 12) = 56  (Arnold + Madeline + Camden + Sarah = 56)
   *  This simplifies to: 2x + 2y + 12 = 56

3. **Solve for 'y' (Sarah's eggs):**
   * 2y = 56 - 2x - 12
   * 2y = 44 - 2x

"Let's break this problem down step by step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.
    *  The blue rope is 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope, so it's 'y - 7' cm long.
    *  The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, making it '4(y - 7)' cm long.

* **Set up an equation:**
    * The total length of all three ropes is 37 cm:  y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

* **Solve for 'y':**
    * y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
    * 6y - 35 = 37
    * 6y = 72
    * y = 12 cm

* **Find the length of the red rope:**
    * Red rope length = 4(y - 7) = 4(12 - 7) = 4(5) = 20 cm

"Here's how to break down Jake's spending:

* **T-shirts:**
    * One T-shirt costs $8.
    * The second T-shirt is 50% off, so it costs $8 * 0.50 = $4.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Aaron's speed:** Since Aaron ran twice as fast as Vanessa, we can figure out his speed by dividing Vanessa's distance by her time.  We don't know Vanessa's time yet, so let's call it ""x"" minutes.
* **Vanessa's distance:** Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, who ran 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.
* **Setting up the equation:** We know Aaron's time is 16 minutes and he ran 2 miles.  His speed is then 2 miles / 16 minutes = 0.125 miles per minute.
* **Vanessa's time:** Vanessa ran 4 miles at a speed of 0.125 miles per minute / 2 = 0.0625 miles per minute.  
* **Calculating Vanessa's time:** To find Vanessa's time, divide her distance by her speed: 4 miles / 0.0625 miles per minute = 64 minutes.

"Here's how to solve this classic problem:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of chickens and 'w' represent the number of cows.**

* **We know:**
    * c + w = 20 (The total number of animals is 20)
    * 2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

* **Solve for 'c' (the number of chickens):**

One way to solve this is using substitution:

1.  Solve the first equation for 'w':  w = 20 - c
2.  Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation: 2c + 4(20 - c) = 70
3.  Simplify and solve for 'c': 2c + 80 - 4c = 70  =>  -2c = -10  =>  c = 5
