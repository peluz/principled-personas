"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and uses 4 for baking muffins for her friends. So, the total number of eggs used by Janet is:

3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for baking) = 7 eggs

The remainder of the eggs that she sells at the farmers' market is:

16 (total eggs) - 7 (used eggs) = 9 eggs

She sells each egg for $2. Therefore, the amount she makes from selling the eggs at the farmers' market every day is:

9 (eggs) * $2 (per egg) = $18

So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."

"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The value increased by 150%, so we need to find 150% of the original purchase price and add it to the original purchase price.

The original purchase price is $80,000. A 150% increase means the value increased by 1.5 times the original price:
\[ 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

Adding this to the original purchase price gives us the new value of the house:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost, which includes the purchase price and the repair cost:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, Josh's profit is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"James runs 3 sprints, each 60 meters, three times a week. 

First, calculate the distance he runs in one session:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters} \]

Then, calculate the total distance he runs in a week:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

So, the total meters James runs a week is:
\[ 540 \text{ meters} \]"
"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken consumes in a day.
2. Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon.
3. Subtract the total morning and afternoon feed from the daily feed requirement to find the amount needed for the final meal.

First, we know each chicken consumes 3 cups of feed per day. With 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we know the chickens are given 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. The total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the morning and afternoon feed from the total daily requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens \(\boxed{20}\) cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of 16 glasses, considering that every second glass is 60% of the regular price.

1. The cost of the first glass is $5.
2. The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = $3\).

This pattern continues, so for every pair of glasses, the total cost is $5 (first glass) + $3 (second glass) = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide 16 by 2 to find out how many pairs of glasses he is buying: \(16 \div 2 = 8\) pairs.

Now, we multiply the cost of one pair by the number of pairs: \(8 \times 8 = $64\).

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"Given that Seattle has 20 sheep, we can use the information provided to find out how many sheep Charleston and Toulouse have.

1. **Seattle's Sheep**: 20
2. **Charleston's Sheep**: Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Charleston's Sheep} = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]
3. **Toulouse's Sheep**: Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so:
   \[
   \text{Toulouse's Sheep} = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

Now, to find the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together, we add the number of sheep each city has:
\[
\text{Total Sheep} = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260
\]

**Final Answer**: 260"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. Calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the file.
2. Add the time taken for the Windows update restart.
3. Calculate the time to download the remaining 60% of the file.
4. Sum up all the times to get the total download time.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Time to download 40% of the file:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \(0.40 \times 200 = 80\) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \(80 \div 2 = 40\) minutes.

2. **Time for the Windows update restart:**
   - This is given as 20 minutes.

3. **Time to download the remaining 60% of the file:**
   - 60% of 200 GB is \(0.60 \times 200 = 120\) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \(120 \div 2 = 60\) minutes.

4. **Total time:**
   - Total time = Time to download 40% + Time for Windows update restart + Time to download 60%
   - Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is 120 minutes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Drive to Realization:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours.
   - He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered during this time.
   - Next, he drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph.
     - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - He then drives the remaining time (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours) at 80 mph.
     - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Covered on Return Trip:**
   - Total distance covered on the return trip = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - John was initially 180 miles away from home.
   - He covered 135 miles on his return trip.
   - Distance remaining from home = Initial distance - Distance covered on return trip = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

**Final Answer:**
John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours."

2. **Overtime Hours (Hours beyond 40):**
   - Overtime hours: \(45 \text{ hours} - 40 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours}\)
   - Overtime rate: \(1.2 \times \$10 = \$12\) per hour
   - Total for overtime hours: \(5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60\)

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings: \( \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \)

Eliza's earnings for this week are \(\$460\)."
"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, which is:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \]

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, so the program had 70% of the second month's downloads:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

The program had a total of 366 downloads over the three months."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Each dozen costs $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Each dozen costs $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Each dozen costs $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330.

Now, we add up the total costs for each type of pastry to get the overall total cost:

- Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit becomes positive.

First, let's break down the costs and revenues:

1. **Initial Cost**: $90 (cost to plant the tree)
2. **Annual Costs**: $3 (water and feed)
3. **Annual Revenue**: 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5

Now, let's calculate the net profit each year after the initial cost:

- **Net Profit per Year**: $10.5 (revenue) - $3 (cost) = $7.5

To find out how many years it will take to recover the initial cost of $90, we divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:

- **Years to Recover Cost**: $90 / $7.5 = 12 years

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

**12 years**"
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there. This leaves her with \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners.

4. According to the problem, after these sales, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

5. To solve for \( x \), first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]

6. Add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]

7. Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 2x = 36 \]

8. Finally, divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners."
"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we have:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after the contemporary dance enrollment:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Now, 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

The rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance. To find out how many students that is, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance from the total number of students:

\[ 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of hip-hop dance students by the total number of students and multiply by 100:

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

\[ 60\% \]"
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the profit from each purchase option after the market increase.

1. **Jewelry Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value after increase: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125
   - Profit from jewelry: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

2. **Electronic Gadgets Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value after increase: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096
   - Profit from electronic gadgets: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing the jewelry, which would yield a profit of $125.

**Final numerical answer:**
$125"
"Each train travels 80 miles westward and then 150 miles northward over the two days. 

To find the total distance covered by each train, we simply add the distances together:

80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her earnings from both her teaching and coaching jobs and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She earns $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
\[ 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} = 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- She earns $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
\[ 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours/week} = 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from coaching are:
\[ 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Finally, we sum up her annual earnings from both jobs to get her total annual salary:
\[ 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} + 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} = 57500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is:
\[ 57500 \, \text{dollars} \]"

3. Calculate the total number of eggs consumed in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Claire eats 3 eggs every day.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are \(4 \times 7 = 28\) days.

Step 3: The total number of eggs consumed in 4 weeks is \(3 \times 28 = 84\) eggs.

Step 4: Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the number of dozens of eggs consumed is \(\frac{84}{12} = 7\) dozens.

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks."
"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time required to cover 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time already spent:**
   \[
   \text{Time spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Determine the remaining time to cover the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining time} = \text{Total time} - \text{Time spent} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - (4 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles}) = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Required speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Remaining time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour."
"First, let's calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink before any is spilled. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, we have:

\[ \text{Water in orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \]

After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the remaining volume is 9 liters. The amount of water spilled is:

\[ \text{Water spilled} = \frac{2}{3} \times 1 = \frac{2}{3} \text{ liters} \]

So, the remaining water in the orange drink is:

\[ \text{Remaining water in orange drink} = \frac{20}{3} - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, we have:

\[ \text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the remaining water from the orange drink and the water from the pineapple drink to find the total amount of water in the 24 liters:

\[ \text{Total water} = 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"

"To find the original price of the book, we can use the relationship between the original price, the discount, and the final price Kyle paid.

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

Given that Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after a 25% discount, this means he paid 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

So, we can write the equation as:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's calculate the value:
\[ P = 26.00 \]

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.00."

2. The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
3. The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together, we get:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. Therefore, the amount spent on the boxes of pizza is:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is:
\[\frac{17}{8.50} = 2\]

So, Marie ordered \(\boxed{2}\) boxes of pizza."
"To find out how much Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the total cost for each type of item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of shorts:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
   - Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
   - Total cost for shorts = 3 pairs * $16.50/pair = $49.50.

2. **Cost of pants:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
   - Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
   - Total cost for pants = 3 pairs * $22.50/pair = $67.50.

3. **Cost of shoes:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
   - Each pair of shoes costs $42.
   - Total cost for shoes = 3 pairs * $42/pair = $126.

Now, we sum up the total costs for all the items:
- Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
- Total cost = $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

Therefore, Mishka spent a total of $243 on all the clothing items."
"Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, so in 60 days, she will consume 60 servings of ice cream.

Each carton contains 15 servings and costs $4.00. To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Since each carton costs $4.00, the total cost for 4 cartons is:

\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00/\text{carton} = \$16.00 \]

After 60 days, Cynthia will spend \(\boxed{16}\) dollars on ice cream."
"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between these two points on his trip.

1. Henry's first stop was after 20 miles.
2. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip. This means he stopped at the 45th mile (since 60 - 15 = 45).

Now, to find the distance between his first and second stops, we subtract the mile marker of the first stop from the mile marker of the second stop:

45 miles (second stop) - 20 miles (first stop) = 25 miles

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

25 miles"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. So, we can write the equation for the total cost of the two pairs of high heels as:
\[ 33 + 2 \times 33 = B - 5 \]

First, calculate the cost of the two pairs of high heels:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Therefore, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up the relationship between Darrell's and Allen's ages using the given ratio and total age.

Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

Given that their total age is 162, we can write the equation:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we can find Allen's current age by substituting \(x\) back into the expression for Allen's age:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine the guesses of each friend.

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we add these guesses together and divide by the number of guesses (which is 3) to find the average.

\[ \text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average guess} = \frac{240}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average guess} = 80 \]

"To find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the daily care time for all dogs.
2. Multiply the daily care time by the number of days in a week.

Step 1: Daily care time for all dogs
- Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day.
- John has 10 dogs.
- So, the total daily care time is \(10 \times 0.5 = 5\) hours.

Step 2: Weekly care time
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Therefore, the total weekly care time is \(5 \times 7 = 35\) hours.

So, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

This gives us two equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now, we can find \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

70"
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Raymond has 40 jewels, and Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Then, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, we subtract 2 from this number to find out how many jewels Siobhan has:

\[ 25 - 2 = 23 \]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points that is, we calculate 25% of 4 points:

\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 1 point more than in the first 20 minutes, which is:

\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Now, to find the total points scored, we add the points from both halves of the game:

\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Total points scored: 9"
"Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Over 30 days, he will consume:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

The yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00. To find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his lego sets. He sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, so:

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 8 video games he buys. Each video game costs $20, so:

\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \]

John has $5 left after buying the video games, so the total amount of money he spent on the video games plus the remaining $5 should equal the money he got from selling the lego sets. We can confirm this by adding the cost of the video games and the remaining money:

\[ 160 + 5 = 165 \]

Since the money from selling the lego sets is $195, and he spent $165, we can see that the calculation is consistent. The question asks how many lego sets he still has, but since he sold all 13 lego sets, the number of lego sets he still has is:

\[ 0 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 0 \]"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   - John runs 3 hours on the first day.
   - Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour.
   - Distance on the first day = \( 3v \) miles.

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   - He runs half as much on the other two days, so each of these days he runs \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.
   - Distance on each of these days = \( 1.5v \) miles.
   - Total distance on the other two days = \( 2 \times 1.5v = 3v \) miles.

3. **Total weekly distance:**
   - Total distance = Distance on the first day + Distance on the other two days
   - Total distance = \( 3v + 3v = 6v \) miles.
   - We know the total weekly distance is 60 miles, so:
     \[
     6v = 60
     \]
   - Solving for \( v \):
     \[
     v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

Therefore, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour."
"First, let's determine Dana's running and walking speeds based on her skipping speed.

Given that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour and this is half as fast as she can run, we can calculate her running speed as follows:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Since Dana can run four times faster than she can walk, we can find her walking speed:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how much time Dana spends running and walking in the six-hour period. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking:
\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance she travels while running and walking:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} = 1.5 \times 4 = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances to find the total distance she can travel in six hours:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 12 + 6 = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"If Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, then Ben's iPhone is 2 years old.

Since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, and Ben's iPhone is 2 years old, Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

Therefore, Brandon’s iPhone is 8 years old."
"When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the gold javelin three times farther than her normal throwing distance. Her normal throwing distance is 400 feet. Therefore, with the gemstone, she can throw the javelin:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

200 feet"
"First, we calculate the total number of pie pieces available initially. Since Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the initial total:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

26"
"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the calorie content of the entire bag of chips:**
   - A serving has 250 calories.
   - There are 5 servings in a 300g bag.
   - Therefore, the total calories in the bag are \( 250 \, \text{calories/serving} \times 5 \, \text{servings} = 1250 \, \text{calories} \).

2. **Calculate the remaining calories you can consume:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume are \( 2000 \, \text{calories} - 1800 \, \text{calories} = 200 \, \text{calories} \).

3. **Determine how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining calories:**
   - The entire bag (300g) contains 1250 calories.
   - To find out how many grams correspond to 200 calories, we set up a proportion:
     \[
     \frac{300 \, \text{g}}{1250 \, \text{calories}} = \frac{x \, \text{g}}{200 \, \text{calories}}
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{300 \, \text{g} \times 200 \, \text{calories}}{1250 \, \text{calories}} = \frac{60000}{1250} = 48 \, \text{g}
     \]

Therefore, you can eat 48 grams of chips."
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed to make 20 candles.
2. Determine the total cost of the supplies.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed.
Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax} \]

Step 2: Determine the total cost of the supplies.
The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00. Therefore, for 2 pounds, the cost is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
If each candle is sold for $2.00, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is:
\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00 \]

Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.
\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:
\[ \$20.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

- On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
- On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[ 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \]

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
\[ 26 \times 4 = 104 \]

Therefore, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is 104."
"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of Post-it notes Candice had: 80.
2. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she used at work: 220.
3. Subtract the number of Post-it notes remaining: 23.

So, the calculation is:

\[ 80 - 220 - 23 = -163 \]

This result indicates that we need to consider the package of Post-it notes she bought. Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as \( x \). The equation becomes:

\[ 80 + x - 220 - 23 = 0 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 80 + x - 243 = 0 \]
\[ x - 163 = 0 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is 163.

163"
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\$200}{\$40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost of each red tie} = \$40 + 0.5 \times \$40 = \$40 + \$20 = \$60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times \$60 = \$600 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \$200 + \$600 = \$800 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{800} \]"
"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

The wire is 4 feet long, so in inches, it is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from 48 inches of wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.
- The building has 15 floors.
- Each floor contains 8 units.
- Therefore, the total number of units is \(15 \times 8 = 120\).

Step 2: Determine the number of occupied units.
- 3/4 of the building is occupied.
- Therefore, the number of occupied units is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90\).

Step 3: Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.
- The number of unoccupied units is \(120 - 90 = 30\).

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"First, let's calculate how many dozens of eggs Lloyd produces per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we calculate how much Lloyd makes per day by selling these dozens of eggs at $2 per dozen:

\[ 21 \text{ dozen} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$42 \]

To find out how much Lloyd makes in a week, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7):

\[ \$42 \times 7 = \$294 \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\$294\) per week from selling eggs."
"To solve this problem, we need to know the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. However, the distance is not provided in the question. Let's assume the distance from the starting point to the destination is \(D\) miles.

1. **Outbound Trip:**
   - Speed: 10 miles per hour
   - Time: 3 hours (from 1 PM to 4 PM)
   - Distance: \(D = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}\)

2. **Return Trip:**
   - Speed: 6 miles per hour
   - Distance: 30 miles (same as the outbound trip)
   - Time: \(\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{mph}} = 5 \, \text{hours}\)

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, the remaining weight he needs to remove is:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys he needs to remove to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds is:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys."

"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after the truck and driver are on it.
2. Determine how many boxes can be added to the truck without exceeding this remaining weight capacity.

First, we know the bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Therefore, the remaining weight capacity of the bridge is:

\[ 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find out how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck, we divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box:

"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg) based on the information given.

Sophia has traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. Therefore, her car's fuel efficiency is:

\[ \text{Fuel Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Distance Traveled}}{\text{Gallons of Gas Used}} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Now, we know that her car's tank holds 12 gallons of gas. To find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank, we multiply the fuel efficiency by the tank capacity:

\[ \text{Miles on a Full Tank} = \text{Fuel Efficiency} \times \text{Tank Capacity} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"First, let's break down the time Jim spends on TV and reading each time he does this activity:

1. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
2. He then reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is \(2 \div 2 = 1\) hour.

So, each time he does this, he spends a total of \(2 + 1 = 3\) hours on TV and reading.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent in a week is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

To find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:

\(9 \times 4 = 36\)

Therefore, Jim spends 36 hours on TV and reading in 4 weeks."

"To find the total number of gems in the chest, we need to calculate the number of each type of gem and then sum them up.

1. **Diamonds**: There are 175 diamonds.
2. **Rubies**: There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So, the number of rubies is \(175 - 35 = 140\).
3. **Emeralds**: There are twice the number of emeralds than the rubies. So, the number of emeralds is \(2 \times 140 = 280\).

Now, we sum up all the gems:
\[175 \text{ (diamonds)} + 140 \text{ (rubies)} + 280 \text{ (emeralds)} = 595\]

Therefore, the total number of gems in the chest is \(\boxed{595}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of boys at Dr. Wertz's school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, the number of boys is:

\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Next, we find the total number of students by adding the number of boys and girls:

\[ 120 + 60 = 180 \]

Given that there are 5 students to every teacher, we can find the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by 5:

\[ \frac{180}{5} = 36 \]

Therefore, the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school is:

\[ 36 \]"
"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to subtract the total amount she received from her allowance from her final total.

Bailey receives $5 each week for 8 weeks, so the total amount from her allowance is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. To find out how much she started with, we subtract the total allowance from her final amount:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60."
"To calculate how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week.
2. Determine the total number of students she teaches in a week.
3. Calculate the total revenue based on the number of students and the charge per student.

First, let's calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week:

- She teaches 5 classes each weekday (Monday to Friday), so that's \(5 \times 5 = 25\) classes.
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.

So, the total number of classes in a week is \(25 + 8 = 33\).

Next, we calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week:

- Each class has 15 students.
- Therefore, the total number of students is \(33 \times 15 = 495\).

Finally, we calculate the total revenue:

- She charges $15.00 per student.
- Therefore, the total revenue is \(495 \times 15 = 7425\).

So, Judy makes \(\boxed{7425}\) dollars in one week."
"The first recipe has 20 instructions.

The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, which means it has \(20 \times 2 = 40\) instructions.

"To calculate the total amount of money Tommy raises, we need to multiply the number of each item sold by its price and then add the totals together.

For brownies:
- Tommy sells 43 slices.
- Each slice is sold for $3.

Total from brownies = 43 slices * $3/slice = $129

For cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells 23 slices.
- Each slice is sold for $4.

Total from cheesecakes = 23 slices * $4/slice = $92

Now, we add the totals from both items to find the overall amount raised:

Total money raised = Total from brownies + Total from cheesecakes
Total money raised = $129 + $92
Total money raised = $221

Tommy raises $221."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones without interest:

\[ 5 \text{ cell phones} \times \$150 \text{ per cell phone} = \$750 \]

Next, we calculate the total interest for the 3-month installment. The interest rate is 2% per unit, and since there are five units, the total interest is:

\[ 5 \times 2\% \times \$150 = 10\% \times \$750 = 0.10 \times \$750 = \$75 \]

So, the total amount Shiela will pay is the sum of the original cost and the interest:

\[ \$750 + \$75 = \$825 \]

Since this total amount is to be paid in 3 monthly installments, we divide the total amount by 3:

\[ \frac{\$825}{3} = \$275 \]

Therefore, Shiela will pay each month for 3 months:

\[ \$275 \]"
"First, let's round the prices to the nearest dollar:

- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3
- Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2

- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3 = $36
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2 = $18
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2 = $34

Finally, we add up the totals to find out how much Artie will make:

$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

Artie will make $88."
"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given that the top level has a square footage of 16, and each subsequent level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of each level as follows:

1. Top level (Level 1): 16 square feet
2. Level 2: \(16 \div 2 = 8\) square feet
3. Level 3: \(8 \div 2 = 4\) square feet
4. Level 4: \(4 \div 2 = 2\) square feet

Now, we sum the square footage of all levels:

\[16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30\]

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:

\[\text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5\]

Therefore, the average square footage of a level is 7.5 square feet."
"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will consume in the first 365 days.

For the first 180 days, the puppy eats 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food consumed in the first 180 days is:
\[ 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

For the remaining days of the first year, which is \(365 - 180 = 185\) days, the puppy eats 2 cups of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food consumed in the remaining 185 days is:
\[ 185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total amount of dog food consumed in the first year:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags needed is:
\[ \frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \text{ bags} \]"
"Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, we can calculate the amount of laundry Raymond and David do based on the given relationships.

1. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. So, if Sarah does 400 pounds, then David does:
\[ \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

2. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. So, if Sarah does 400 pounds, then Raymond does:
\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds."
"To determine how much money Vincent saves, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in the most economical way versus the less economical way.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:
- Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
- Total cost: \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15.00 \)

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1.00 each:
- Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
- Total cost: \( 9 \times 1.00 = 9.00 \)

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two options to determine the savings:
- Savings: \( 15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00 \)

Therefore, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price."
"The original cost of the grooming is $100. With a 30% discount, the cost is reduced by 30% of $100.

30% of $100 = 0.30 * $100 = $30

Subtract the discount from the original cost:
$100 - $30 = $70

The final cost of the grooming is $70."
"Each girl got \( \frac{1}{6} \) of 24 liters of water. So, the amount of water each girl got is:

\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they got together is:

\[ 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

The boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water distributed is:

\[ 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

The initial amount of water was 24 liters. Therefore, the amount of water left is:

\[ 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

10 liters of water were left."

3. He receives 23 more stickers for his birthday, so now he has \(31 + 23 = 54\) stickers.
4. Charlie gives 9 stickers to his sister, so now he has \(54 - 9 = 45\) stickers.
5. He uses 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so now he has \(45 - 28 = 17\) stickers.

Therefore, the final number of stickers Charlie has left is 17."
"First, let's calculate Alex's weight. Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. So, we calculate 4 times Grace's weight and then subtract 2 pounds.

\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \]
\[ 500 - 2 = 498 \]

So, Alex weighs 498 pounds.

Now, to find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight to Alex's weight.

\[ 125 + 498 = 623 \]

Their combined weights are 623 pounds."

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( W + L = 22 \)
2. \( W = L + 8 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find the number of games they won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

The alarm rang a total of 22 times."
"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the salary increase after 5 years.
2. Calculate the salary increase for each of the next three years.

**Step 1: Calculate the salary after 5 years.**

Sylvie's initial salary is $600. After 5 years, her salary is increased by 10% of the initial salary.

\[ \text{Salary after 5 years} = 600 + (0.10 \times 600) = 600 + 60 = 660 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the salary for each of the next three years.**

The salary increases by 10% each year. We need to apply this increase for three consecutive years.

\[ \text{Salary after 6 years} = 660 + (0.10 \times 660) = 660 + 66 = 726 \]

\[ \text{Salary after 7 years} = 726 + (0.10 \times 726) = 726 + 72.6 = 798.6 \]

\[ \text{Salary after 8 years} = 798.6 + (0.10 \times 798.6) = 798.6 + 79.86 = 878.46 \]

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service (i.e., after 8 years total) is $878.46."
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies."
"Christina invited 16 friends, but since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we need to calculate the number of guests who are expected to attend.

1/4 of 16 friends don't show up, so:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \text{ friends don't show up} \]

Therefore, the number of friends who are expected to attend is:
\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ friends} \]

Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest. So, for 12 guests, she needs:
\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \text{ gift bags} \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost will be:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Christina will spend $18."
"To determine how much potato salad Ted needs to bring, we first calculate the amount each type of dinosaur will eat and then sum these amounts.

1. **Adult Dinosaur Consumption:**
   - Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
   - There are 20 adults.
   - Total for adults: \( 20 \times 10 = 200 \) lbs.

2. **Child Dinosaur Consumption:**
   - Each child eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) lbs.
   - There are 5 children.
   - Total for children: \( 5 \times 5 = 25 \) lbs.

3. **Total Potato Salad Needed:**

"First, we need to determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, and Lee's current time is 38 seconds, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's current time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to calculate Gerald's new time after his diet improved his speed by 10%. A 10% improvement in speed means his time is reduced by 10% of his original time. We can calculate the reduction in time as:

\[ \text{Reduction in time} = 10\% \times \text{Gerald's original time} = 0.10 \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 4 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, Gerald's new time is:

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = \text{Gerald's original time} - \text{Reduction in time} = 40 \text{ seconds} - 4 \text{ seconds} = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

So, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in \(\boxed{36}\) seconds."
"Given that the number of dogs is 60, and there are two cats for every dog, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we first find the combined number of dogs and cats:

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120
Combined number of dogs and cats = 180

The number of rabbits is twelve less than this combined number:

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the Grade 5 class.

Given that 2/5 of the students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the total number of students is 200, the number of girls can be calculated by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. We are told that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, so:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scout is 40."

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the volume of tomatoes before they are cooked into sauce.
2. Calculate the number of cans of tomatoes used.
3. Calculate the number of tomatoes used based on the number of cans.

First, we know that the sauce made is 32 ounces, and this is after the tomatoes have lost half their volume when cooked. This means that the volume of tomatoes before cooking was twice the volume of the sauce. So, the volume of tomatoes before cooking is:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes were used to get 64 ounces of tomatoes. The number of cans is:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is:
\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We start with 30 cars on the motorway.
2. After 15 minutes, some cars drive through the traffic jam.
3. In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through the traffic jam.
4. Additionally, 5 cars take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the 30 minutes is \( x + 20 \).

Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that actually drove through the traffic jam is the original number of cars minus the 5 that took an exit. This gives us the equation:

\[ x + 20 = 30 - 5 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

Now, solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box, then find its inner volume, and finally multiply by 3.

Given that the walls are 1 inch thick, the inner dimensions of each box will be reduced by 2 inches in each dimension (1 inch from each side).

So, the inner dimensions of each box are:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

The inner volume of one box is calculated as:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 3 \, \text{inches} \times 4 \, \text{inches} \times 2 \, \text{inches} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 24 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
\[ \text{Total Volume} = 24 \, \text{cubic inches/box} \times 3 \, \text{boxes} \]
\[ \text{Total Volume} = 72 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
72 cubic inches"
"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the total hours of TV he watched throughout the week and then isolate the Wednesday viewing.

1. **Monday and Tuesday**: Frankie watched 1-hour episodes each night.
   - Total for Monday and Tuesday: \(1 \, \text{hour} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 2 \, \text{hours}\)

2. **Thursday**: Frankie watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show.
   - Total for Thursday: \(1 \, \text{hour} + 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 1.5 \, \text{hours}\)

3. **Friday**: Frankie watched two 1-hour episodes.
   - Total for Friday: \(2 \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 2 \, \text{hours}\)

4. **Total hours for Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday**: 
   - \(2 \, \text{hours} + 1.5 \, \text{hours} + 2 \, \text{hours} = 5.5 \, \text{hours}\)

5. **Total hours of TV watched in the week**: 7 hours.

6. **Hours watched on Wednesday**:
   - \(7 \, \text{hours} - 5.5 \, \text{hours} = 1.5 \, \text{hours}\)

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, we can determine the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday by dividing the total hours watched on Wednesday by the length of each episode:
- Number of 30-minute episodes on Wednesday: \(1.5 \, \text{hours} \div 0.5 \, \text{hours/episode} = 3 \, \text{episodes}\)

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday."
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies. However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he had left is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To calculate the final cost after the cashback reward, follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon.
2. Calculate the total cashback for 10 gallons at $0.20 per gallon.
3. Subtract the total cashback from the total cost to get the final cost.

Step 1: Total cost of 10 gallons of gas
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00/\text{gallon} = \$30.00 \]

Step 2: Total cashback for 10 gallons
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20/\text{gallon} = \$2.00 \]

Step 3: Final cost after cashback
\[ \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

The final cost of the gas after the cashback reward is \$28.00."
"To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate in total, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each of them had.

For Beatrice:
- The roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice had is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

For Marcell:
- The roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell had is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Now, we add the total number of fruit roll-ups that both Marcell and Beatrice had:
- Total = \(48 + 42 = 90\).

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by the number of people (which is 2):
- Average = \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\).

Therefore, on average, they ate 45 fruit roll-ups."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many feet Julia rows to reach the shore and then calculate the amount of water that enters the boat based on the given rate.

First, we find out how many feet Julia rows in 64 seconds. We know that it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, the rate at which she rows is:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} \]

Now, we calculate the total distance she rows in 64 seconds:

\[ \text{Distance} = \left(\frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}}\right) \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the rate at which water enters the boat, which is 2 liters for every 10 feet rowed. To find out how much water enters the boat over 80 feet, we use the following calculation:

\[ \text{Water} = \left(\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore."
"To determine how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.
2. There are 4 teachers.
3. Each lesson requires the whiteboard to be cleaned 3 times.

First, calculate the total number of lessons in a day:
\[ 4 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ lessons per teacher} = 8 \text{ lessons per day} \]

Next, calculate the total number of cleanings per day:
\[ 8 \text{ lessons per day} \times 3 \text{ cleanings per lesson} = 24 \text{ cleanings per day} \]

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
2. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. So, Brittany's phone can hold \( \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \) photographs.
3. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as \( D \). Therefore, we have \( 300 = 50D \).
4. Solving for \( D \), we get \( D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \).

So, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is 6."
"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue from selling it, then find the difference between the two.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:

- Sasha bought ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each.
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
  \]

- She also bought five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each.
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
  \]

- The total cost of the lumber is:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:

- She sells the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards. Since the price has increased by 50%, the new price per board is:
  \[
  \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15
  \]
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150
  \]

- She sells the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at the new price, which is also 50% higher than the original price of $16:
  \[
  \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24
  \]
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120
  \]

- The total revenue from selling the lumber is:
  \[
  \$150 + \$120 = \$270
  \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[
\$270 - \$180 = \$90
\]

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of \(\boxed{90}\)."
"Given that Katy uses sugar and water in the ratio of 7:13, we can represent the amount of sugar she uses as \(7x\) and the amount of water as \(13x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total amount of sugar and water used is given as 120 teaspoons. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 13x = 120\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[20x = 120\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now, to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used, we multiply \(x\) by 7 (since the ratio of sugar is 7 parts):

\[7x = 7 \times 6 = 42\]

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is 42."
"John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children. Since each pair of shoes costs $60, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

1. First, find the total number of pairs of shoes: \(2 \text{ pairs/child} \times 3 \text{ children} = 6 \text{ pairs}\).
2. Then, calculate the total cost: \(6 \text{ pairs} \times \$60/\text{pair} = \$360\).

Therefore, John paid $360."
"On the first day, the customs officer counted 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles, which totals to:

\[2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles}\]

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles already at the port from the new total:

\[30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles}\]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:

\[\frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles/container}} = 4 \text{ containers}\]

Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.
   - Let Lylah's salary four years ago be \( L \).
   - Therefore, \( 40,000 = L + 0.30L = 1.30L \).
   - Solving for \( L \), we get \( L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = 30,769.23 \) (approximately).

2. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Four years later, his salary increased by 40%.
   - Therefore, Adrien's new salary is \( 40,000 + 0.40 \times 40,000 = 40,000 \times 1.40 = 56,000 \).

3. **Calculate Lylah's salary four years later:**
   - Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.
   - Assuming Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's (40%), her new salary is \( 30,769.23 + 0.40 \times 30,769.23 = 30,769.23 \times 1.40 = 43,076.92 \) (approximately).

4. **Calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:**
   - Adrien's new salary is $56,000.
   - Lylah's new salary is approximately $43,076.92.
   - Therefore, the total salary is \( 56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92 \).

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is approximately $99,076.92."
"Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week. Since there are 30 sheets of paper in each pad, he uses \(2 \times 30 = 60\) sheets of paper per week.

- Twice the amount of apples as Morisette, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) apples
- Half the number of oranges as Morisette, which is \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) oranges

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits each person brought:
- Morisette: \(5 + 8 = 13\) fruits
- Kael: \(10 + 4 = 14\) fruits

Adding the total number of fruits they both brought:
- Total fruits: \(13 + 14 = 27\)

Therefore, the total number of fruits they have is 27."
"Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday.

For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less each day, so:
- Tuesday: 8 - 2 = 6 hours
- Wednesday: 8 - 2 = 6 hours

For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so:
- Thursday: 6 + 1 = 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 7 hours

Now, let's add up all the hours she slept throughout the week:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours
- Saturday: 7 hours

"Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps. So, the number of letters she stamps is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]

These 20 letters are added to the pile of already-stamped letters. If there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, then the number of letters that were already in that pile when Jennie began is:

\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \]

So, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.
4. After using the spoons, she had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as \( x \).

So, the total number of spoons Julia had before using any was \( x + 5 \) (the package she bought plus the package her husband bought).

After using 3 spoons, she had 12 spoons left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ x = 10 \]

So, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

"Given that each pepper costs $15, we can calculate the cost of the other items based on this information.

1. **Cost of a watermelon:**
   - A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.
   - Therefore, the cost of a watermelon = 3 * $15 = $45.

2. **Cost of an orange:**
   - An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs.
   - Therefore, the cost of an orange = $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the items Dillon is buying:

- **Cost of 4 watermelons:**
  - 4 * $45 = $180.

- **Cost of 20 peppers:**
  - 20 * $15 = $300.

- **Cost of 10 oranges:**
  - 10 * $40 = $400.

Finally, we add up the costs to find the total amount Dillon will spend:

- Total cost = $180 (watermelons) + $300 (peppers) + $400 (oranges) = $880.

**Total amount of money he will spend:** $880."
"To calculate the hospital's profit from these visits, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time spent by doctors with patients in a day.
2. Calculate the total revenue from patients.
3. Calculate the total cost to the hospital for the doctors' time.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time spent by doctors with patients in a day.**

- Number of patients per day: 500
- Average time per patient: 24 minutes

Total time in minutes = 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes

Convert minutes to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from patients.**

- Charge per hour from patients: $200
- Total hours of patient visits: 200 hours

Total revenue from patients = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost to the hospital for the doctors' time.**

- Charge per hour to the hospital: $150
- Total hours of doctor visits: 200 hours

Total cost to the hospital = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000

**Step 4: Calculate the profit.**

Profit = Total revenue from patients - Total cost to the hospital
Profit = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000

The hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits."

"To determine how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the number of questions he was able to complete in each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions in each test.

For the first test:
- Total questions: 75
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 8 hours

First, we calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the first test:
\[ \text{Questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time available} = 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 40 \, \text{questions} \]

Since the test had 75 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is:
\[ \text{Incomplete questions} = \text{Total questions} - \text{Questions completed} = 75 - 40 = 35 \]

For the second test:
- Total questions: 100
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 6 hours

Next, we calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the second test:
\[ \text{Questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time available} = 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{questions} \]

Since the test had 100 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is:
\[ \text{Incomplete questions} = \text{Total questions} - \text{Questions completed} = 100 - 30 = 70 \]

Adding the incomplete questions from both tests:
\[ \text{Total incomplete questions} = 35 + 70 = 105 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"

1. \( B = 2Q \) (twice as many babies as queens)
2. \( W = 2B \) (twice as many worker bees as baby bees)
3. The total number of bees is 700, so \( Q + B + W = 700 \).

First, we can express \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):
- \( B = 2Q \)
- \( W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q \)

Now, substituting \( B \) and \( W \) in the total number of bees equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
- \( B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200 \)
- \( W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400 \)

So, the number of worker bees is \( 400 \).

400"
"First, let's calculate how many hours Jordan spends playing video games in a week. Since he plays for 2 hours every day, and there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total hours spent playing video games as follows:

\[ 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{hours/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jordan would earn if he spent those 14 hours working instead of playing video games. Since he earns $10 per hour at his part-time job, we can calculate his earnings as follows:

\[ 14 \, \text{hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$140/\text{week} \]

Therefore, if Jordan spent his video game time working instead, he would earn \(\$140\) in one week."
"First, let's identify the food and non-food items from the list:

- Milk: Food item (2 dollars)
- Eggs: Food item (3 dollars)
- Light bulbs: Non-food item (3 dollars)
- Cups: Non-food item (3 dollars)
- Roach traps: Non-food item (4 dollars)

Next, we calculate the total cost of the non-food items:
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars

Total cost of non-food items = 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Now, we apply the 10% tax on the non-food items:
Tax on non-food items = 10% of 10 dollars = 0.10 * 10 = 1 dollar

So, the total cost of the non-food items including tax is:
10 dollars (original cost) + 1 dollar (tax) = 11 dollars

Now, we add the cost of the food items:
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars

Total cost of food items = 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Finally, we add the total cost of the food items to the total cost of the non-food items including tax:
Total cost = 5 dollars (food) + 11 dollars (non-food with tax) = 16 dollars

Therefore, the total cost of everything is 16 dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have:

- Kim already has 3 clients.
- He is talking to 5 potential clients.
- Therefore, the total number of clients will be \(3 + 5 = 8\).

Next, we calculate the total expenses for the supplies:

- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
- The cost of 1 bottle of bleach is $2.
- The cost of 1 pack of cloths is $5.
- Therefore, the cost for supplies per client is \(2 \times 2 + 1 \times 5 = 4 + 5 = 9\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total expenses for all clients:

- The total number of clients is 8.
- The cost per client is $9.
- Therefore, the total expenses are \(8 \times 9 = 72\) dollars.

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:

- Total income = $92
- Total expenses = $72
- Profit = Total income - Total expenses = $92 - $72 = $20

Therefore, the profit Kim will make each week is $20."
"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare that John can harvest in one harvest.
2. Determine how many harvests John can make in a year.
3. Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the number of harvests in a year to get the total number of pineapples harvested in a year.

Step 1: Pineapples per hectare per harvest
- There are 100 pineapples per hectare.

Step 2: Number of harvests in a year
- John can harvest every 3 months.
- There are 12 months in a year.
- Therefore, the number of harvests in a year is \( \frac{12}{3} = 4 \) harvests.

Step 3: Total pineapples harvested in a year
- Total pineapples = Pineapples per hectare per harvest × Number of hectares × Number of harvests in a year
- Total pineapples = 100 × 10 × 4
- Total pineapples = 4000

Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year."
"Johnny has three Lego sets to pick up. 

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, which is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, which is \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

To find the total number of pieces Johnny picks up, we add the pieces from all three sets:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

Johnny picks up 2125 blocks."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First 6 hours**: 30 bees leave the hive.
2. **Next 6 hours**: 1/2 of 30 bees return, which is 15 bees.
3. **Following 6 hours**: Two times as many bees as left in the first 6 hours leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
4. **Last 6 hours**: All the bees that left in the first 6 hours and did not return in the next 6 hours return. Since 15 bees returned in the second 6 hours, 30 - 15 = 15 bees did not return. Therefore, 15 bees return in the last 6 hours.

So, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is **15**."
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we first need to calculate the total cost of the tickets.

The cost for 1 child ticket is $10, and the cost for 1 adult ticket is $12. Therefore, the total cost for both tickets is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$10 + \$12 = \$22 \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means the amount she gave the cashier minus the total cost of the tickets equals $8. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ \text{Amount given} - \text{Total cost} = \text{Change} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Amount given} - \$22 = \$8 \]

To find the amount given, we add $22 to $8:

\[ \text{Amount given} = \$22 + \$8 = \$30 \]

Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up some equations based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has as \(D\).

According to the problem:
- Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, which can be written as \(3D\).
- James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, which can be written as \(4D\).
- Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook, so we can write the equation \(3D = 12\).

First, we solve for \(D\):
\[3D = 12\]
\[D = \frac{12}{3}\]
\[D = 4\]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends, we can find out how many friends James has:
\[4D = 4 \times 4 = 16\]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends.

Final numerical answer:
16"
"To determine how long the winner will wait for the loser, we need to calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Steve's time: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Tim's time: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

The difference in their times is:
- \(40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\)

Therefore, the winner (Steve) will be waiting for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

The final answer is:
4 minutes"
"To calculate how much Shawnda made that day, we need to consider the number of tires inflated and the cost per tire.

- Each bicycle has 2 tires, so 5 bicycles mean \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- Each tricycle has 3 tires, so 3 tricycles mean \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- A unicycle has 1 tire, so 1 unicycle means \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Adding these up, the total number of tires inflated is \(10 + 9 + 1 = 20\).

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost is \(20 \times 0.25 = 5\) dollars.

Therefore, Shawnda made \(\boxed{5}\) dollars that day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys:

10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Next, we calculate the total cost of these cookies:

60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.00

Now, we determine how much change Carl receives if he pays with a $10 bill:

$10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00

So, the change Carl receives is $4.00."
"Let's work through the problem step by step, starting from the end and moving backwards.

1. **Final state**: 5 fries are left.
2. **Before ants carried off the last fry**: There were 6 fries (since the ants carried off the last one).
3. **Before the raccoon took two-thirds**: Let's denote the number of fries before the raccoon took them as \( x \). The raccoon took two-thirds, leaving one-third, so \( \frac{1}{3}x = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 18 \).
4. **Before the pigeons ate**: The pigeons each ate 3 fries, and there were 3 pigeons, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries. Therefore, before the pigeons ate, there were \( 18 + 9 = 27 \) fries.
5. **Before the seagull ate half of what Dave ate**: Let's denote the number of fries the seagull ate as \( y \). The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, so \( y = \frac{1}{2} \times 14 = 7 \). Therefore, before the seagull ate, there were \( 27 + 7 = 34 \) fries.
6. **Before Dave ate 14 fries**: Dave ate 14 fries, so the original number of fries in the pack was \( 34 + 14 = 48 \).

Therefore, the number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it was 48."
"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the hours for the days he has three 1-hour classes:
- He has three 1-hour classes each on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.
- So, for these three days, he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours per day.
- Over three days, that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the hours for the days he has two 2-hour classes:
- He has two 2-hour classes each on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
- So, for these two days, he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours per day.
- Over two days, that's \(2 \times 4 = 8\) hours.

Now, let's add the hours from both types of days to get the total weekly hours:
- Total weekly hours = \(9 + 8 = 17\) hours.

Finally, to find the total hours for the entire semester, we multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks in the semester:
- Total semester hours = \(17 \times 16 = 272\) hours.

So, Kimo spends a total of 272 hours attending classes in one semester."
"First, let's convert all measurements to feet since the final answer needs to be in feet.

- Each roll is 4 inches long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each roll is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet long.
- Each chocolate croissant is 6 inches long, which is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet long.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Now, let's calculate the total length for each type of baked good:

- For the rolls: \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.
- For the chocolate croissants: \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.
- For the baguettes: \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

Adding these together gives the total length:

\( 100 + 60 + 120 = 280 \) feet.

Therefore, if Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they will be 280 feet long."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we first calculate the monthly requirement for each type of ape and then double it for the 2-month period.

1. **Monkeys' Requirement:**
   - Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(200 \times 2 = 400\) bananas.

2. **Gorillas' Requirement:**
   - Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(400 \times 2 = 800\) bananas.

3. **Baboons' Requirement:**
   - Baboons need 100 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(100 \times 2 = 200\) bananas.

Now, we add up the total number of bananas needed for all the apes over 2 months:
\[400 \text{ (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas}.\]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Since the football field is 100 yards long, running back and forth once is 200 yards. Blake runs this distance 15 times, so:

\[ 200 \, \text{yards} \times 15 = 3000 \, \text{yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards, 34 times. So:

\[ 80 \, \text{yards} \times 34 = 2720 \, \text{yards} \]

Now, we need to find out how much farther Blake runs than Kelly:

\[ 3000 \, \text{yards} - 2720 \, \text{yards} = 280 \, \text{yards} \]

So, the winner (Blake) runs 280 yards farther than the loser (Kelly)."
"To find out how much Raphael spent on everything, we need to calculate the total cost of each item he bought and then sum these amounts.

1. The cost of the pens: \(4 \text{ pens} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pen} = \$6\)
2. The cost of the notebooks: \(2 \text{ notebooks} \times \$4 \text{ per notebook} = \$8\)
3. The cost of the rim of bond paper: \(\$20\)

\$6 + \$8 + \$20 = \$34
\]

Therefore, Raphael spent a total of \(\$34\) on everything."
"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 of them come out from hiding, and since they were already counted in the initial 11, we don't add them again. Instead, we consider that now all 11 are visible. After that, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, which means we subtract these 2 from the total number of tadpoles that were visible.

So, the number of tadpoles Finn can see now is:

11 (initially visible) - 2 (that hid) = 9

Finn can now see 9 tadpoles in the pond."
"On Monday, the tank has a depth of 17 feet.

On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth is:
\[ 17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet} \]

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday, so the depth is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

The tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin:

- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3

Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by Locsin:

- Starfish: 5 fewer than Anakin = 10 - 5 = 5
- Sea horses: 3 fewer than Anakin = 6 - 3 = 3
- Clownfish: 2 more than Anakin = 3 + 2 = 5

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, we add the totals caught by Anakin and Locsin to find the overall total:

Total fish caught by Anakin and Locsin = 19 + 13 = 32

Final numerical answer:
32"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

First, let's determine how many times the price will increase in 36 months. Since the price increases every two months, we divide 36 by 2:

\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

This means the price will increase 18 times over 36 months.

The original price of the bag of marbles is $20. Each time the price increases, it increases by 20% of the original price. A 20% increase can be represented as multiplying by 1.20 (since 100% + 20% = 120%, or 1.20 in decimal form).

The formula to calculate the price after \( n \) increases is:

\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} \times (1.20)^n \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):

\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366 \]

So, the final price is:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32 \]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $787.32."
"Given:
- 5 red cars, each costing $4.
- 3 action figures, each costing $5.
- The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.

First, calculate the total cost of the red cars:
\[ 5 \text{ red cars} \times \$4 \text{ per red car} = \$20 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the action figures:
\[ 3 \text{ action figures} \times \$5 \text{ per action figure} = \$15 \]

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5:
\[ \text{Cost of the doll} = 3 \times \$5 = \$15 \]

Now, add up the total cost of all the toys:
\[ \$20 \text{ (red cars)} + \$15 \text{ (action figures)} + \$15 \text{ (doll)} = \$50 \]

Therefore, the total worth of all the toys is:
\[ \$50 \]"
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the total cost of hiring the accountant and compare it to the lost income from doing her taxes herself.

1. Calculate the lost income from doing her taxes herself:
   - She loses $35 for each hour of freelance work.
   - She loses 3 hours of work.
   - Lost income = $35/hour * 3 hours = $105.

2. The cost of hiring the accountant is $90.

3. Calculate the difference between the lost income and the cost of hiring the accountant:
   - Difference = Lost income - Cost of hiring the accountant
   - Difference = $105 - $90 = $15.

So, if Jackie hires the accountant, she will have $15 more. 

**Final Answer:**

"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she has chosen and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's add up the costs of the items:
- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €102
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 + €74 + €102

Now, let's perform the addition step by step:
1. €1090 + €157 = €1247
2. €1247 + €74 = €1321
3. €1321 + €102 = €1423
4. €1423 + €74 = €1497
5. €1497 + €102 = €1599

The total cost of the items is €1599. However, Elvira's budget is only €1500. Since the total cost exceeds her budget, she will not have any money left for clothing. In fact, she will be short by €99.

Therefore, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is:

"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she will need for 15 Spanish flans.

Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs. Therefore, for 15 flans, Sandra will need:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Sandra's neighbor gives her a basket of 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28, so \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

We can simplify the second equation:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:
\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

16"
"Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. If Ethel has $8, then twice the money Ethel has is 2 * $8 = $16. Adding $2 to that amount gives us $16 + $2 = $18.

Therefore, Jimmy has $18."
"Pancho walks 20 miles each day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, the miles he walks from Monday to Friday is:

\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles each day. So, the miles he walks on the weekend is:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the miles from the weekdays and the weekend together gives:

\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Pancho walks a total of 120 miles in a week."
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the hat is given as $25.
2. The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so:
   \[ \text{Cost of jacket} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \]
3. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so:
   \[ \text{Cost of pants} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \]

Now, we sum up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to get the total cost of each uniform:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \]

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs for each group of creatures and then sum them up.

1. **Spiders:**
   - Number of spiders: 80
   - Legs per spider: 8
   - Total legs from spiders: \(80 \times 8 = 640\)

2. **Insects:**
   - Number of insects: 90
   - Legs per insect: 6
   - Total legs from insects: \(90 \times 6 = 540\)

3. **Rare mutant invertebrates:**
   - Number of rare mutant invertebrates: 3
   - Legs per rare mutant invertebrate: 10
   - Total legs from rare mutant invertebrates: \(3 \times 10 = 30\)

Now, we sum up the legs from all the creatures:
\[640 + 540 + 30 = 1210\]

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is \(\boxed{1210}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Sally Thirtytwo's age**: Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. **Sally Four's age**: Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. **Granny Red's age**: Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. So, Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. **Sally Two's age**: Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. So, Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of all four birds:
- Sally Two: 19 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years

Total age = \(19 + 8 + 16 + 8 = 41\)

The total age of the four birds is 41."
"First, let's calculate the total minimum monthly payment Jessica needs to make on all her debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. So, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum monthly payment and add it to the total minimum monthly payment:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

Therefore, the total monthly payment Jessica will make is:

$1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:

$1500 * 12 = $18000

So, Jessica pays $18000 in a year."
"To calculate the total time Billy will take to prep the potatoes, we need to consider the time taken for both peeling and cutting each potato.

1. **Peeling Time:**
   - Time to peel one potato = 1.5 minutes
   - Total number of potatoes = 60
   - Total peeling time = 1.5 minutes/potato * 60 potatoes = 90 minutes

2. **Cutting Time:**
   - Time to cut one potato = 5 seconds
   - Total number of potatoes = 60
   - Total cutting time = 5 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 300 seconds

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert the cutting time to minutes:
   - Total cutting time in minutes = 300 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 5 minutes

3. **Total Time:**
   - Total time = Peeling time + Cutting time

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost per gallon of lemonade:**
   - Cost of lemons per gallon: $3
   - Cost of sugar per gallon: $2
   - Total cost per gallon: $3 + $2 = $5

2. **Determine the revenue per gallon of lemonade:**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50
   - They get 20 glasses per gallon
   - Revenue per gallon: 20 glasses * $0.50/glass = $10

3. **Determine the profit per gallon of lemonade:**
   - Profit per gallon: Revenue per gallon - Cost per gallon
   - Profit per gallon: $10 - $5 = $5

4. **Determine the number of gallons they sold:**
   - They made a total profit of $25
   - Number of gallons sold: Total profit / Profit per gallon
   - Number of gallons sold: $25 / $5 = 5 gallons

5. **Determine the total cost of lemons:**
   - Cost of lemons per gallon: $3
   - Total cost of lemons: Number of gallons sold * Cost of lemons per gallon
   - Total cost of lemons: 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15

Therefore, they spent $15 on lemons."
"First, let's determine the number of Chinese participants in the race. We know there are 240 Asians in total and 80 of them are Japanese. Therefore, the number of Chinese participants is:

\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

Next, we are told that out of these 160 Chinese participants, 60 are boys. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent and car fuel.

1. Rent: \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his salary
\[ \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \]

2. Car fuel: \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his salary
\[ \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \]

Now, let's find out how much is left after these expenses.
\[ \text{Remaining after rent and car fuel} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \]

Next, Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
\[ \text{Donation to charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \]

Now, let's find out how much is left after the donation.
\[ \text{Remaining after donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \]

Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$.
\[ \text{Total given to daughter and wife} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, let's calculate how much money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations.
\[ \text{Final amount} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{350} \]"

"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we need to first find out the number of white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, and Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies. Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( W \).

From the information given:
\[ 5W = 200 \]

Solving for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now, we know Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can denote the number of red roses as \( R \).

From the information given:
\[ R = 4W \]

Substituting the value of \( W \):
\[ R = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Jan is 30 years old.
2. Two years ago, Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.
3. Let's denote Mark's current age as \( M \).
4. Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
5. According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   M - 2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 28 + 5
   \]
6. Simplify the right side of the equation:
   \[
   M - 2 = 14 + 5 = 19

"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay.

**Faster Team:**
Each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time for the faster team = 4 runners × 55 seconds = 220 seconds.

**Less Well-Rounded Team:**
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Total time for the less well-rounded team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

**Difference in Time:**
The faster team's total time is 220 seconds, and the less well-rounded team's total time is 222 seconds.
Difference = 222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by calculating the ratio of the probabilities and then converting it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[ \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \]

This means the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200\% \]

So, it is 200% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

**Final Answer:**

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to account for the monthly interest of 2% on the initial debt of $100.

1. **First Month:**
   - Initial amount: $100
   - Interest for the first month: $100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2
   - Amount after the first month: $100 + $2 = $102

2. **Second Month:**
   - Amount at the start of the second month: $102
   - Interest for the second month: $102 * 2% = $102 * 0.02 = $2.04
   - Amount after the second month: $102 + $2.04 = $104.04

3. **Third Month:**
   - Amount at the start of the third month: $104.04
   - Interest for the third month: $104.04 * 2% = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808
   - Amount after the third month: $104.04 + $2.0808 = $106.1208

"Let's denote the number of bags the trader bought and sold as \( x \).

The cost to buy each bag is $20, and the cost to transport each bag is $2. Therefore, the total cost per bag is \( 20 + 2 = 22 \) dollars.

The selling price per bag is $30. The profit per bag is then \( 30 - 22 = 8 \) dollars.

The trader made a total profit of $400. Therefore, the total profit can be expressed as \( 8x = 400 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold \(\boxed{50}\) bags."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The tickets cost $20.25 in total. The food cost $4.50 less than the tickets, so the food cost is:

\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the rides. Each ride costs $33, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is:

\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:

\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:

So, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of trees**: 50 trees.
2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, so the net increase is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees per year.
3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the net increase is \(8 \times 10 = 80\) trees. Adding this to the initial number of trees, we get \(50 + 80 = 130\) trees.
4. **Trees that die**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, the number of trees that die is \(0.30 \times 130 = 39\) trees.
5. **Final number of trees**: Subtracting the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years, we get \(130 - 39 = 91\) trees.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. After a month, she collected three times that number, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number from the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\), so she collected \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Elaine has now:

- Initial cards: 20
- Cards after the first month: 60
- Cards after the second month: 40
- Cards after the third month: 200

Total cards = Initial cards + Cards after the first month + Cards after the second month + Cards after the third month
Total cards = 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320

So, Elaine has 320 Pokemon cards now in total."

"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we need to consider that she can remove her lowest score from the five tests before calculating the average. Let's first identify her lowest score among the first five tests:

- 89
- 71
- 92
- 100
- 86

The lowest score is 71. We will remove this score and calculate the average of the remaining four scores plus the sixth test score, aiming for an average of 93.

Let's denote the score Brinley needs on the sixth test as \( x \).

The sum of the scores of the four highest tests is:
\[ 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367 \]

Including the sixth test score, the sum of the five scores (after removing the lowest) will be:
\[ 367 + x \]

Since the average of these five scores needs to be 93, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{367 + x}{5} = 93 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first multiply both sides by 5:
\[ 367 + x = 465 \]

Then, we subtract 367 from both sides:
\[ x = 465 - 367 \]
\[ x = 98 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 98 on her sixth test to get an average of 93.

"To find the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the distance for each period and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the distance for the first four weeks:
- He rode 5 times a week.
- Each ride was 25 kilometers.
- He did this for 4 weeks.

So, the total distance for the first four weeks is:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance for the following three weeks:
- He rode 2 times a week.
- Each ride was 60 kilometers.
- He did this for 3 weeks.

So, the total distance for the next three weeks is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ km/ride} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km} \]

Now, we add the distances from both periods to get the total distance:

"First, let's determine the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can calculate the weight of each candied apple as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40g}{2} = 20g \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars:

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40g = 1000g \]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples:

\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20g = 1600g \]

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000g + 1600g = 2600g \]

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600 grams."
"On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

To find the total number of cakes she bought over the three days, we add the number of cakes from each day:

\(4 + 12 + 60 = 76\)

So, Rose bought a total of 76 cakes after all three days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates would be 6 plates.
   - Therefore, the cost of half a dozen plates is \(6 \times 6000 = 36000\) dollars.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is \(36000 - 1200 = 34800\) dollars.

3. **Determine the cost of one dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups cost $34800.
   - Therefore, one dozen cups cost \(\frac{34800}{20} = 1740\) dollars.

4. **Determine the cost of one cup:**
   - One dozen cups is 12 cups.
   - Therefore, the cost of one cup is \(\frac{1740}{12} = 145\) dollars.

The total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{145}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is $20 * 2 = $40.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Next, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- She babysits 4 times, earning $5 each time, so she earns $5 * 4 = $20 from babysitting.

Now, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from mowing the lawn:
- Let's say she needs to mow the lawn \( x \) times to earn enough money.
- Each time she mows the lawn, she earns $4, so she earns $4x from mowing the lawn.

Sara already has $10 saved. So, the total amount of money she will have after mowing the lawn \( x \) times is:
\[ 10 + 20 + 4x \]

We need this total to be at least $70 to afford the jacket and shoes:
\[ 10 + 20 + 4x \geq 70 \]
\[ 30 + 4x \geq 70 \]
\[ 4x \geq 40 \]
\[ x \geq 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final numerical answer is:
4"
"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, as Gary walks around the edge of the park. The park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles by 6 miles.

The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Substituting the given dimensions:
\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the distance (perimeter of the park) and the speed:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking."
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total.

So, the number of customers on the third day is \(500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\).

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, we can express the amount of water in each pool 4 minutes ago as follows:

- The small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons 4 minutes ago.
- The big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons 4 minutes ago.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the problem also states that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

Substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool now has \( 8 \) gallons of water.

Final answer:
8"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the shoes and the belt is $352.00.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Her part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find the number of hours, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed.

The additional amount is 10% of $2000, which is:
\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months at $165 per month:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be:
\[ 220 \]"
"There are 4 roses in the vase. There are 7 more dahlias than roses, so there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias. 

To find the total number of flowers, we add the number of roses and dahlias together: 4 + 11 = 15.

Total number of flowers in the vase: 15."
"Given that Harriet is currently 21 years old, we can determine the ages of Adrian and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's current age = 21 years.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's current age = 21 * 2 = 42 years.
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age = 21 * 3 = 63 years.

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet's age = 21 + 3 = 24 years.
- Zack's age = 42 + 3 = 45 years.
- Adrian's age = 63 + 3 = 66 years.

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \]

The average age of the three in three years is 45 years."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.
4. The total points scored by the four students is 251.

First, we calculate the points scored by Yuri and Brianna:

- Yuri's points: \( \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44 \)
- Brianna's points: \( 68 + 17 = 85 \)

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:

- Naomi: 68 points
- Yuri: 44 points
- Brianna: 85 points

The total points scored by these three students is:

\[ 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \]

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find Jojo's points by subtracting the points scored by the other three students from the total:

\[ 251 - 197 = 54 \]

So, Jojo scored 54 points."
"To find out how much time Carmen spent on these games, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on Sudoku puzzles separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- Time to finish one crossword puzzle = 10 minutes
- Number of crossword puzzles solved = 3
- Total time spent on crossword puzzles = 10 minutes/puzzle * 3 puzzles = 30 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time spent on Sudoku puzzles:
- Time to finish one Sudoku puzzle = 5 minutes
- Number of Sudoku puzzles solved = 8
- Total time spent on Sudoku puzzles = 5 minutes/puzzle * 8 puzzles = 40 minutes

Now, we add the time spent on both activities:
- Total time spent = Time on crossword puzzles + Time on Sudoku puzzles
- Total time spent = 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes

Therefore, Carmen spent 70 minutes playing these games."
"Initially, the water tank has 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters, so the amount of water left in the tank is:

120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters

Celine then collects rainwater, which is twice the amount left in the tank. So, the amount of rainwater collected is:

2 * 30 liters = 60 liters

Adding the rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives:

30 liters + 60 liters = 90 liters

Therefore, the final amount of water in the tank is:

90 liters"
"Andy plants 90 geraniums. He plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, which means he plants \(90 - 40 = 50\) petunias.

To find the total number of flowers, we add the number of geraniums and petunias together:

\[90 + 50 = 140\]

So, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers."
"The company spends $15000 on advertising for the first year. For the second year, it spends a third of that amount, which is:

\[ \frac{15000}{3} = 5000 \]

\[ 15000 + 5000 = 20000 \]

The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"To find the total cost for both Carlos and Benji, we need to calculate the cost for each of them separately and then add those costs together.

First, let's calculate the cost for Carlos:
- Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour.
- He uses the canoe for 3 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Carlos is \(30 \times 3 = 90\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Benji:
- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour.
- He uses the raft for 5 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Benji is \(18 \times 5 = 90\) dollars.

Now, we add the costs together to find the total amount they will pay:
- Total cost = Cost for Carlos + Cost for Benji
- Total cost = \(90 + 90 = 180\) dollars.

So, the total amount they will pay for their rentals, altogether, is 180 dollars."
"To travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus, it takes Andrew 6 days. 

The trip by car takes half as many days as the bus trip, so:
\[ \text{Car trip duration} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ days} \]

If Andrew goes to Rochester by bus and returns by car, the total travel time is the sum of the bus trip and the car trip:
\[ \text{Total travel time} = 6 \text{ days (bus)} + 3 \text{ days (car)} = 9 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the total number of days Andrew will travel is:
9 days"
"First, let's calculate the new total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type cards and buying 14 grass type cards.

- Initial number of fire type cards: 30
- Initial number of grass type cards: 20
- Initial number of water type cards: 40

After losing 8 water type cards:
- New number of water type cards: 40 - 8 = 32

After buying 14 grass type cards:
- New number of grass type cards: 20 + 14 = 34

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards:
- Total number of cards = 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 33.33 \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is:
\[ 33 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

Therefore, Chad still owes $9.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces:**
   - Kalinda places 4 pieces per minute.
   - Her mom places half as many pieces as Kalinda, so her mom places \(4 / 2 = 2\) pieces per minute.

2. **Calculate the combined rate of placing pieces:**
   - Together, they place \(4 + 2 = 6\) pieces per minute.

3. **Calculate the total time required to complete the puzzle:**
   - The puzzle has 360 pieces.
   - At a combined rate of 6 pieces per minute, the time required to complete the puzzle is \(360 / 6 = 60\) minutes.

4. **Convert the time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, 60 minutes is equal to \(60 / 60 = 1\) hour.

So, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest after two months.
2. Subtract the number of harvested watermelons from the total to find the remaining watermelons.
3. Calculate how many of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks.
4. Subtract the number of harvested watermelons after two weeks from the remaining watermelons to find out how many were not ready to be harvested.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest after two months:**
   - Total watermelons: 120
   - Percentage ready for harvest: 30%
   - Number of watermelons ready for harvest: \( 120 \times 0.30 = 36 \)

2. **Subtract the number of harvested watermelons from the total to find the remaining watermelons:**
   - Remaining watermelons: \( 120 - 36 = 84 \)

3. **Calculate how many of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks:**
   - Fraction of remaining watermelons ready for harvest: \( \frac{3}{4} \)
   - Number of watermelons ready for harvest: \( 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63 \)

4. **Subtract the number of harvested watermelons after two weeks from the remaining watermelons to find out how many were not ready to be harvested:**
   - Remaining watermelons after two weeks: \( 84 - 63 = 21 \)

Therefore, the number of melons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is 21."
"To calculate the total amount Mark pays for everything, we need to consider the cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees.

1. **Cost of the cars**: 12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000
2. **Tax on the cars**: 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000
3. **Registration fees**: $1,000 per car * 12 cars = $12,000

Now, we add these amounts together to get the total cost:

$240,000 (cost of cars) + $24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (registration fees) = $276,000

Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for everything is $276,000."

"First, let's determine how many tomatoes Steve's girlfriend eats per day. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, and Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, his girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes per day (6 / 2 = 3).

Now, let's calculate the total number of tomatoes they both eat per day:
- Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day.
- His girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes per day.
- Together, they eat 6 + 3 = 9 tomatoes per day.

Next, we need to find out how many tomatoes they eat in a week:
- They eat 9 tomatoes per day.
- In a week, they eat 9 * 7 = 63 tomatoes.

Since a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, we need to determine how many vines are required to produce 63 tomatoes:
- 63 tomatoes / 3 tomatoes per vine = 21 vines.

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines to produce enough tomatoes for both him and his girlfriend."

"Johnny initially took his allowance of $20 and added an extra $10 to it. So, the total amount of money he had was:

\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \]

This sum of $30 was then invested, and it tripled in a year. Therefore, the amount of money he had after a year would be:

\[ 30 \times 3 = 90 \]

So, after a year, Johnny had $90."
"Given that Jessa is 20 years old, we can determine the ages of Joan and Mary as follows:

1. Joan is five years older than Jessa.
   - Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 years.

2. Mary is two years younger than Joan.
   - Mary's age = Joan's age - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23 years.

Now, to find the sum of the ages of the three girls:
- Jessa's age = 20 years
- Joan's age = 25 years
- Mary's age = 23 years

Sum of their ages = Jessa's age + Joan's age + Mary's age
                  = 20 + 25 + 23
                  = 68 years

The sum of the ages of the three girls is 68."
"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.
2. Calculate the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A.
3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students.
4. Subtract the number of students who went out through exits A and B from the total to find the number who went out through exit C.

Let's start with step 1:

1. 30% of 1000 students went out through exit A:
   \[
   0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]

2. The number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A:
   \[
   1000 - 300 = 700
   \]

3. 3/5 of the remaining 700 students went out through exit B:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
   \]

4. The number of students who went out through exit C is the remaining students after those who went out through exits A and B:
   \[
   700 - 420 = 280
   \]

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine how many candies Robert has:**
   - We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert.
   - John has 54 candies.
   - Therefore, Robert has \( \frac{54}{2} = 27 \) candies.

2. **Determine how many candies James has:**
   - James has 6 more candies than Robert.
   - Robert has 27 candies.
   - Therefore, James has \( 27 + 6 = 33 \) candies.

3. **Calculate how many more candies John has than James:**
   - John has 54 candies.
   - James has 33 candies.
   - Therefore, John has \( 54 - 33 = 21 \) more candies than James.

**Final numerical answer:**
John has 21 more candies than James."
"Dolly has 2 books, and Pandora has 1 book. If both read each other's books as well as their own, we need to consider the total number of books read by both, without double-counting any book.

- Dolly will read her 2 books plus Pandora's 1 book, totaling 3 books.
- Pandora will read her 1 book plus Dolly's 2 books, totaling 3 books.

However, since the question asks for the total number of books collectively read, and each book is read by at least one person, we simply add the number of books each has:

2 (Dolly's books) + 1 (Pandora's book) = 3 books.

So, collectively, they will read 3 books by the end.

"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike is still corresponding with after he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. He originally had 5 pen pals and stopped being pen pals with 2, so he is now corresponding with:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, so the total number of letters Mike receives in a week is:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 6 letters a week. Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages he writes in a week is:

\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \]

Mike writes a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, the total time he spends writing a week is:

\[ 30 \times 6 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert this time into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{180}{60} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Mike spends 3 hours writing a week."
"First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason uses for his 15-minute calls with his boss each day. Since there are 30 days in the month, he uses:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes he used for calls to other people:

\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the monthly plan of 1000 minutes:

\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Jason has 250 minutes left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin now has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Griffin now has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries.
4. Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. So, Griffin now has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than what Kyle took, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Griffin now has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

The total number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 4 + 32 = 36 \).

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. The difference in the number of snails is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

So, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times (2F) \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium."
"To calculate the total amount Jean paid for the makeup services, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily cost of the makeup artist's services.
2. Calculate the weekly cost of the makeup artist's services.
3. Calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks of the movie.
4. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.

Let's start with the daily cost:

- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
- It takes 6 hours each day to do the makeup.
- Therefore, the daily cost is \( 250 \times 6 = 1500 \) dollars.

Next, we calculate the weekly cost:

- The makeup is done 4 times a week.
- Therefore, the weekly cost is \( 1500 \times 4 = 6000 \) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks of the movie:

- The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
- Therefore, the total cost before the discount is \( 6000 \times 5 = 30000 \) dollars.

Finally, we apply the 10% discount:

- The discount is 10% of the total cost.
- Therefore, the discount amount is \( 30000 \times 0.10 = 3000 \) dollars.
- The final amount Jean paid is \( 30000 - 3000 = 27000 \) dollars.

So, Jean paid a total of $27,000."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Isabelle spent on the party supplies:

- Cake ingredients: $12
- Birthday presents: $43
- Decorations: $15
- Invitations: $4
- Goodie bags: $22

Adding these amounts together:

\[ 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 96 \]

The total cost of the party supplies is $96. Isabelle split this cost evenly with her two parents, so the cost is divided into three equal parts.

To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ \frac{96}{3} = 32 \]

Each person paid $32."
"The chef bought 4 bags of onions, with each bag weighing 50 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of onions is:

4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

The cost of onions is $1.50 per pound, so the total cost is:

200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

In total, Sue ate \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies over the two days.

Sue's sister ate \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies over the two days.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories Sue consumed are \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

The total calories Sue's sister consumed are \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.

The difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister is \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories.

Therefore, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."
"To find the number of boys in the third class, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of students in the school:**
   - Each class has 20 students.
   - There are 3 classes.
   - Therefore, the total number of students in the school is \(20 \times 3 = 60\).

2. **Number of boys and girls in the school:**
   - The school is 50% boys and 50% girls.
   - Therefore, the number of boys in the school is \(60 \times 0.5 = 30\).
   - The number of girls in the school is also \(60 \times 0.5 = 30\).

3. **Number of girls in the first and second classes:**
   - The first class has 15 girls.
   - The second class has 12 girls.
   - Therefore, the total number of girls in the first and second classes is \(15 + 12 = 27\).

4. **Number of girls in the third class:**
   - Since the total number of girls in the school is 30, the number of girls in the third class is \(30 - 27 = 3\).

5. **Number of boys in the third class:**
   - Each class has 20 students.
   - The third class has 3 girls.
   - Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is \(20 - 3 = 17\).

**Final answer:**
17 boys are in the third class."
"Travis originally had 61 apps. After deleting 9 apps, he had:

\[ 61 - 9 = 52 \]

So, the final number of apps on his tablet is 70."
"Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Since he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

Therefore, the number of wolves he killed today is 3 times the number of cougars, which is 3 * 12 = 36 wolves.

Now, let's add up all the animals he killed:

- Wolves: 10 (from last night) + 36 (from today) = 46 wolves
- Cougars: 15 (from last night) + 12 (from today) = 27 cougars

Total animals killed: 46 wolves + 27 cougars = 73 animals.

"First, let's determine how many times Anne went down the slide. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. Mitchel went down the slide 30 times, so we calculate 30% of 30:

\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]

Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, so we subtract 9 from 30:

\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Anne went down the slide 21 times. Now, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, so we multiply 21 by 4:

\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 84 \]"
"Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, which totals to:

\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, each stall gets:

\[ \frac{40}{20} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Adding these 2 new cows to the original 20 cows in each stall, each stall now has:

\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ cows} \]

To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:

\[ 22 \times 8 = 176 \]

Therefore, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:

176"

"First, let's calculate the total number of 10-foot sections in the 200-foot tall redwood:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight of the redwood before termites ate any of it is:

\[ 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Termites ate 30% of the redwood, so 70% of the redwood remains. To find the remaining weight, we calculate 70% of 8000 pounds:

\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the weight of the redwood after the termites have eaten 30% of it is:

\[ 5600 \text{ pounds} \]"

"Given that Andrea has 52 apples, we can start by determining how many apples Jamal has. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Andrea's apples} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]

Substituting the number of apples Andrea has:

\[ 52 = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]

Solving for Jamal's apples:

\[ \text{Jamal's apples} = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

Next, we know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. Therefore, we can calculate the number of bananas Jamal has:

\[ \text{Jamal's bananas} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can find the number of bananas Andrea has:

\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{\text{Jamal's bananas}}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits:

\[ \text{Total fruits} = \text{Andrea's apples} + \text{Andrea's bananas} + \text{Jamal's apples} + \text{Jamal's bananas} \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \]

"To determine how many cups of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making over the two days and then find out how much flour is required for that number of cookies.

1. Calculate the total number of cookies:
   - Today: 36 cookies
   - Tomorrow: 30 cookies
   - Total: 36 + 30 = 66 cookies

2. Determine the amount of flour needed for 66 cookies:
   - 2 cups of flour make 12 cookies
   - Therefore, for 66 cookies, we need to find out how many sets of 12 cookies are in 66:
     66 ÷ 12 = 5.5 sets of 12 cookies
   - Since each set of 12 cookies requires 2 cups of flour, we multiply the number of sets by 2:
     5.5 × 2 = 11 cups of flour

So, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

Then, she gets 20 more marbles from her friend. So, the total number of marbles she has now is:

\[ 250 + 20 = 270 \]

Therefore, Maddison has 270 marbles now."
"First, let's determine the number of trees Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, and Chris has 6 trees, Ferdinand has:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ trees} \]

Next, we calculate the number of trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has 3 trees, twice that number is:

\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Adding 5 to this number gives us the number of trees Harry has:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ trees} \]

Now, to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:

\[ 11 - 3 = 8 \]

So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8 \]"
"Carmen has $100.

Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has:
\[ 100 + 25 = 125 \]

Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has:
\[ 125 + 50 = 175 \]

To find out how much all three girls have combined, we add their amounts together:
\[ 100 + 125 + 175 = 400 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money all three girls have combined is:
400"
"To determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then compare it to her budget.

1. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   \[
   \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \text{ of } \$350,000 = 0.05 \times 350,000 = \$17,500
   \]

2. **Calculate the transfer fee:**
   \[
   \text{Transfer fee} = 12\% \text{ of } \$350,000 = 0.12 \times 350,000 = \$42,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total price of the house:**
   \[
   \text{Total price} = \text{Selling price} + \text{Brokerage fee} + \text{Transfer fee} = \$350,000 + \$17,500 + \$42,000 = \$409,500
   \]

4. **Determine how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Total price} - \text{Budget} = \$409,500 - \$400,000 = \$9,500
   \]

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to subtract the transfer fees, brokerage fees, and the remaining loan amount from the selling price.

1. **Transfer Fees**: 3% of $400,000
\[ \text{Transfer Fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

2. **Brokerage Fee**: 5% of $400,000
\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

3. **Remaining Loan Amount**: $250,000

Now, we subtract these amounts from the selling price to find the net proceeds.

\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Transfer Fees} - \text{Brokerage Fee} - \text{Remaining Loan Amount} \]
\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = 400,000 - 12,000 - 20,000 - 250,000 \]
\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = 400,000 - 282,000 \]
\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = 118,000 \]

Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are $118,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and calculate the time for each part.

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:** This takes 20 minutes.

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:** It takes 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees. 
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:** It takes 5 minutes less time than the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - The total heating time to 400 degrees is 28 minutes.
   - So, the cooking time is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

4. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:** This is the sum of the heating time to 300 degrees, the additional heating time to 400 degrees, and the cooking time.
   - Total time = \(20 + 28 + 23 = 71\) minutes.

**Final numerical answer:**
71 minutes"
"To find out how much the real estate agent spent on all the ads, we need to calculate the total cost for the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the newspaper ads:
- The cost per newspaper ad is $5.
- The number of newspaper ads bought is 50.
- Therefore, the total cost for newspaper ads is \(5 \times 50 = 250\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the television ads:
- The cost per television ad is $75.
- The number of television ads bought is 15.
- Therefore, the total cost for television ads is \(75 \times 15 = 1125\) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs for the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of newspaper ads + Cost of television ads
- Total cost = \(250 + 1125 = 1375\) dollars.

Therefore, the real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on buying all the ads."
"The juggler can juggle 16 balls in total. Half of these balls are golf balls, so there are 16 / 2 = 8 golf balls. Half of these golf balls are blue, so there are 8 / 2 = 4 blue golf balls.

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has \(300 / 2 = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, we add the M&Ms from all three bags together:
\[300 + 312 + 150 = 762\]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. John has 2 houses.
2. Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - So, each house has \(3 \times 2 = 6\) windows in the bedrooms.
3. Each house has an additional 4 windows not connected to the bedrooms.
   - So, each house has \(6 + 4 = 10\) windows in total.

Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows is:
\[10 \times 2 = 20\]

Therefore, the total number of windows between the houses is 20."
"To find out how much change the cashier gives back, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items the mother bought. 

The cost of cocoa is $4.20, the cost of laundry is $9.45, and the cost of the package of pasta is $1.35. Adding these amounts together:

\[ 4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35 = 15.00 \]

The mother pays with $20. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:

\[ 20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00 \]

So, the change the cashier gives back is $5.00."
"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we first need to calculate the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

1. The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches the body of the sweater takes. So, the collar takes:
\[ \frac{900}{10} = 90 \text{ stitches} \]

2. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar. So, the rosette takes:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \text{ stitches} \]

3. The total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We can now calculate the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette:
\[ 90 + 180 = 270 \text{ stitches} \]

4. Subtract the stitches used for the collar and the rosette from the total number of stitches to find the number of stitches used for the sleeves:
\[ 1800 - 270 = 1530 \text{ stitches} \]

5. Since the sweater has two sleeves, we divide the remaining stitches by 2 to find the number of stitches per sleeve:
\[ \frac{1530}{2} = 765 \text{ stitches} \]

Each sleeve takes 765 stitches."
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add these amounts together.

"To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each part and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\) lines from the first scene.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\) lines from the second scene.

Now, we sum up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
- Solo song: 54 lines
- First scene: 36 lines
- Second scene: 48 lines

Total lines = \(54 + 36 + 48 = 138\)

2. Calculate the total time for the large holes:
   - Time for one large hole = 10 minutes
   - Total time for 15 large holes = 15 * 10 minutes = 150 minutes

3. Add the total times for small and large holes:
   - Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

4. Convert the total time from minutes to hours:
   - 240 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 4 hours

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes."
"The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 20 + 20 = 40.

40"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

Sam is currently 6 years old."

"First, let's determine the number of spots on a mamba. Since a cobra has 70 spots and has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can calculate the number of spots on a mamba as follows:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas, so:

\[ \text{Total spots on cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]
\[ \text{Total spots on mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of spots for all the snakes:

\[ \text{Total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots:

\[ \text{Half the number of spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones.
2. Subtract this length from the total length of the necklace to find the length occupied by the sterling silver beads.
3. Divide the length occupied by the sterling silver beads by the length of each bead to find the number of beads.

Let's start with step 1. Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace, and each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long. Therefore, the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones is:
\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Next, for step 2, we subtract the length occupied by the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace to find the length occupied by the sterling silver beads:
\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

For step 3, we know each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find the number of beads, we divide the length occupied by the sterling silver beads by the length of each bead:
\[ \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{\frac{1}{4} \text{ inch/bead}} = 17 \times 4 = 68 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

\[ 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Next, we find the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals they have together. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times 39 \]

Calculating the right side of the equation:

\[ 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for the household, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.
2. Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.
3. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.
4. Finally, determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

Step 1: Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. There are 5 members in the household, and they eat rice at both lunch and dinner. Therefore, the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household is:
\[ 0.2 \, \text{kg/person} \times 5 \, \text{people} = 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \]

Step 2: Since they eat rice at both lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is:
\[ 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Step 3: To find out how much rice is consumed per week, we multiply the daily consumption by the number of days in a week:
\[ 2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{kg/week} \]

Step 4: To determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's calculate the total number of crates sold:

- Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates.
- On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
- On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
- On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

Now, let's add these numbers together:

20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:

120 (target) - 65 (sold) = 55 crates

So, Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week."
"To determine the total cost of the antique desk for Carmen, we need to calculate the sequence of bids and sum them up.

1. The opening bid is $200.
2. Each subsequent bid increases by $50.

Since there are 3 other people who each bid once, Carmen will bid 3 times after them. Therefore, the bids will be as follows:

- First bid (after the opening bid): $200 + $50 = $250
- Second bid: $250 + $50 = $300
- Third bid: $300 + $50 = $350

Now, we sum up all the bids Carmen made:

$250 (first bid) + $300 (second bid) + $350 (third bid) = $900

Therefore, the total cost of the desk for Carmen is $900."
"To calculate the total cost John pays for the driving service in a year, we need to consider both the mileage charges and the monthly bonuses.

1. **Mileage Charges:**
   - Distance to work one way: 30 miles
   - Total distance per day: 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles
   - Distance per week: 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week
   - Distance per year: 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year
   - Cost per mile: $2
   - Total mileage cost per year: 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000

2. **Monthly Bonuses:**
   - Bonus per month: $150
   - Number of months in a year: 12
   - Total bonus cost per year: $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost per year = Total mileage cost + Total bonus cost
   - Total cost per year = $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800

Therefore, John pays a total of $31,800 a year for the driving service."
"To find out how many minutes Peter has to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

So, the total time exercised on Monday and Sunday combined is:
23 minutes + 16 minutes = 39 minutes.

Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined on Tuesday. Therefore, we need to multiply the total time by 2:
39 minutes * 2 = 78 minutes.

So, Peter has to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the structure of the folding process. Each piece of paper, when folded in half, can accommodate two pages: one on the left front and one on the left back, and similarly for the right front and right back.

Given that a 32-page tabloid requires pages to be printed in pairs on each sheet, we can calculate the number of sheets as follows:

- Pages 1 and 2 are on the first sheet.
- Pages 3 and 4 are on the second sheet.
- This pattern continues until we reach pages 31 and 32 on the 16th sheet.

Since each sheet of paper can hold 2 pages, the total number of sheets required for 32 pages is:

\[ \frac{32 \text{ pages}}{2 \text{ pages per sheet}} = 16 \text{ sheets} \]

Therefore, 16 pieces of paper would be used in a 32-page tabloid.

"Annika started with $50. She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

So, she spent $25 on food and snacks. She also spent an additional $10 on rides. Therefore, the total amount spent is:

\[ 25 + 10 = 35 \]

To find out how much is left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:

\[ 50 - 35 = 15 \]

So, the amount left is $15."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Elise started with 250 books.
2. There are currently 50 unsold books.
3. This means she has sold \(250 - 50 = 200\) books in total.
4. She sold 45 books this year.
5. She sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, so she sold \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books in the first year.
6. The total books sold so far is \(90 + 45 + \text{second year sales} = 200\).

From this, we can find out how many books she sold in the second year:
\[90 + 45 + \text{second year sales} = 200\]
\[135 + \text{second year sales} = 200\]
\[\text{second year sales} = 200 - 135 = 65\]

Since each book sells for $20, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is:
\[65 \times 20 = 1300\]

So, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is $1300."
"First, let's calculate Watson's weekly earnings from his hourly wage:

Watson works 10 hours a day for 5 days a week, so he works a total of:
\[ 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 50 \, \text{hours/week} \]

At a rate of $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
\[ 50 \, \text{hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Since the company performed well for the whole month of April, Watson also receives a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total weekly earnings are:
\[ \$500 + \$300 = \$800/\text{week} \]

April typically has 4 weeks, so Watson's total earnings for the month are:
\[ \$800/\text{week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = \$3200 \]

Therefore, Watson made:
\[ \$3200 \] in April if the company performed very well for the whole month."
"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. 

First, calculate how many people he beat:
\[ 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \]

Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total and beat 16, the number of people he lost to is:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, John lost to 4 people."
"First, let's calculate how many loaves are sold in the morning. Two-thirds of the 60 loaves are sold in the morning:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning. This leaves:

\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \]

loaves unsold after the morning. Half of these remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening. So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10."
"Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so he loses 2 pounds per week (8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds/week).

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds (the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks), we can set up the following:

If Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks, then to lose 8 pounds, we can use the proportion:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{x \text{ weeks}} \]

Solving for \(x\):

\[ x = \frac{8 \text{ pounds} \times 4 \text{ weeks}}{2 \text{ pounds}} = 16 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

"To calculate the savings, we need to determine the discount for each item and then multiply by the quantity purchased.

1. **Discount on ice cream:**
   - Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
   - Sale price of one tub of ice cream: $11
   - Discount per tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

2. **Discount on milk:**
   - Discount per packet of milk: $0.5

Now, we calculate the total savings for 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk.

- Savings on 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 * $2 = $4
- Savings on 4 packets of milk: 4 * $0.5 = $2

Total savings: $4 + $2 = $6

"To determine the number of new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many times the serum will cause the growth of an extra arm and an extra leg within that period.

1. **Growth of Extra Arms:**
   - The serum causes an extra arm every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra arms grown is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).

2. **Growth of Extra Legs:**
   - The serum causes an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra legs grown is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs.
   - Total new limbs = 5 (extra arms) + 3 (extra legs) = 8.

Therefore, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, the cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
\[ 5 \times \$100 + \$700 = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

The total amount Theo wants to save is $2000. Therefore, the total amount he can spend on the trip is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

Now, let's sum up the costs of the suits, suitcases, and flight ticket:
\[ \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$2050 \]

The amount left for buying gifts is:
\[ \$4000 - \$2050 = \$1950 \]

Therefore, Theo has to spend \(\boxed{1950}\) on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"First, let's break down the daily egg consumption:

- Three people eat 3 eggs each, so that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
- The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each, so that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.

Adding these together, the family consumes \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs per day.

To find out how many eggs the family consumes in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\(13 \times 7 = 91\)

So, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"If Quinn is 30 years old, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, then Jane is:

\[ 30 - 3 = 27 \]

years old.

Since Trent is 5 years older than Jane, Trent's age is:

\[ 27 + 5 = 32 \]

So, Trent is 32 years old."
"Let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step.

1. Cera is currently 46 years old.
2. Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
3. Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.
4. Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age, which means the population was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

Since the population six years ago was half of what it is now, the current population of Chile is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

Therefore, the population of Chile now is 120000."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem, the number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).

The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{1}{2}D \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3.5D = 105 \]

To find \( D \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3.5:

\[ D = \frac{105}{3.5} = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness. 8 people couldn't come due to illness.

Now, we need to find out how many people had previous commitments. It's given that 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. So, the number of people with previous commitments is:

\(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\)

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Finally, to find out how many people showed up for the party, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:

\(24 - 10 = 14\)

So, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is 14."
"First, let's calculate the number of marbles Solomon received from his father. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, and his father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \) times as many marbles as he bought. So, the number of marbles his father gave him is:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has. Initially, the store had 50 marbles, Solomon bought 20 more, and his father gave him 8 more. So, the total number of marbles is:

\[ 50 + 20 + 8 = 78 \]

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of the marbles is:

\[ 78 \times 2 = 156 \]

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:

\[ 156 \text{kgs} \]"
"To calculate the cost to fill the pool, we first need to determine the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep, so the volume \( V \) is calculated as:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \times 5 \, \text{ft} \]
\[ V = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

The cost to fill the pool is $.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = V \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{\$/cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 12 \, \text{\$} \]

The cost to fill the pool is $12."
"Given that the classroom has 30 boys, we can use the information provided to find the number of girls and nongendered children.

1. The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys:
   \[ \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

2. The number of nongendered children is 1/10 the number of boys:
   \[ \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \]

To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
\[ \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

1. Let the number of electric poles be \( P \) and the number of electric wires be \( W \).
2. According to the ratio, \( P:W = 1:3 \).
3. This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.
4. Given \( W = 45 \), we can set up the proportion: \( \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \).
5. Substituting \( W = 45 \) into the proportion, we get \( \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \).
6. Solving for \( P \), we multiply both sides by 45: \( P = \frac{45}{3} \).
7. Therefore, \( P = 15 \).

The total number of electric poles required is 15."
"At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, 1/4 of 40 people left, which is 10 people.

If 22 men stayed at the party, then the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3 men.

Since 10 people in total left and 3 of them were men, the remaining 7 people who left must be women.

Therefore, the number of women who left is 7.

Initially, there were 15 women, so the number of women left at the party is 15 - 7 = 8 women.

"The magazine costs half as much as a book, and the book costs $4. So, the magazine costs:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = \$2 \]

A pen costs $1 less than a magazine, so the pen costs:

\[ 2 - 1 = \$1 \]

The pen costs $1."
"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. According to the problem, Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together give a total of 26 pencils. 

We can set up the equation for the pencils in Jam's boxes as follows:
\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + \text{Loose pencils} = \text{Total pencils} \]
\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + 2 = 26 \]

From this, we can find the number of pencils in the boxes:
\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} = 26 - 2 = 24 \]

Now, we know that Jam has 24 pencils in boxes and 2 loose pencils, making a total of 26 pencils. 

Next, we need to find out how many pencils Jam and Meg have in total:
\[ \text{Total pencils} = \text{Pencils Jam has} + \text{Pencils Meg has} \]
\[ \text{Total pencils} = 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Now, we need to determine how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all 72 pencils. Since the problem does not specify the capacity of each box, we assume that the boxes are of the same capacity as the ones Jam originally had, which can hold 24 pencils each.

To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the total number of pencils by the capacity of one box:
\[ \text{Number of boxes needed} = \frac{\text{Total pencils}}{\text{Capacity of one box}} \]
\[ \text{Number of boxes needed} = \frac{72}{24} = 3 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 3 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ice cubes are added to cool the coffee by 65 degrees and then calculate the weakening effect of both the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, we calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so the number of ice cubes required is:

\[ \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Next, we calculate the weakening effect of these 5 ice cubes. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so the total weakening effect from the ice cubes is:

\[ 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters} \]

Additionally, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. Therefore, the total weakening effect is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:

\[ 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio and apply it to the number of new records the people received.

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means for every new record received, 2 old records are given up.

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records given up as follows:

\[ \text{Total old records} = 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior programmers. Given that the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, and the total number of employees is 100, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total monthly payment to junior programmers is:

\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so their monthly payment is:

\[ \text{Monthly payment to senior programmers} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

The total monthly payment to senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:

\[ \text{Total payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:

\[ \boxed{224000} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal be \( x \).

2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).

3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

4. Simplifying the expression, we get \( x + 6 \).

5. We know that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, \( x + 6 = 20 \).

6. Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 20 - 6 = 14 \).

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

3. He passes 14 out to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\).
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends: \(14 \times 2 = 28\). Adding these to the 8 he has left: \(8 + 28 = 36\).
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\).
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\).

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31."
"To fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, it needs an additional 40 percentage points of charge. Given that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to recharge the remaining 40 percentage points as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes per percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ 120 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."
"Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her another 10 lollipops, so she then has:

She has 14 lollipops left."
"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

\[ \text{Rewards earned} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

On this shopping trip, the customer spent $43 and used their $4 rewards. However, they also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the coupon took \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars off the price.

The total discount from the rewards and the coupon is:

\[ 4 + 8 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting this discount from the $43 spent:

\[ 43 - 12 = 31 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the customer paid:

"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A:

- Annual pay: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
- Tax: 20% of $30,000 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B:

- Annual pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Remaining pay after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax on remaining pay: 10% of $36,000 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:

- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the job with the higher net pay rate (Job B) and the other job (Job A) is:

$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate (Job B) compared to the other job (Job A)."
"First, we calculate the number of ruined castles by finding 40 percent of the total castles in Scotland:

\[ \text{Number of ruined castles} = 220 \times \frac{40}{100} = 220 \times 0.4 = 88 \]

Next, we find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned, knowing that half of them are unmanned:

\[ \text{Number of unmanned ruined castles} = 88 \times \frac{1}{2} = 44 \]

So, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is 44."
"To find the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total cost for each offer and then subtract one from the other.

- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

For Cozy Homes:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, we find the difference between the two total costs:
- Cost difference: $3,450 - $3,350 = $100

The cost difference between the two offers is $100."
"To find out how many guns each person would have if they shared them equally, we first need to calculate the total number of guns they have combined.

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, Richard has 5 guns, and Jason (RJ) has 1 gun. So, the total number of guns is:

\[ 8 + 10 + 5 + 1 = 24 \]

There are 4 people (DJ, Nick, Jason, and Richard), so we divide the total number of guns by 4 to find out how many each would have if shared equally:

\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

Each of them would have 6 guns if they shared their guns equally.

"To calculate the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we can break it down as follows:

- For 8 batches of suckers: \(8 \times 30 \text{ ounces} = 240 \text{ ounces}\)
- For 1 batch of fudge: \(1 \times 70 \text{ ounces} = 70 \text{ ounces}\)

Adding these together gives the total amount of sugar needed:

\(240 \text{ ounces} + 70 \text{ ounces} = 310 \text{ ounces}\)

Therefore, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge."
"First, let's calculate the value of the shares after the first year. Maria initially buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the initial total value is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price per share after the increase, we calculate:

\[ \$8 \times 1.50 = \$12 \]

So, the value of the 8 shares after the first year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. The new price per share after the decrease is:

\[ \$12 \times 0.75 = \$9 \]

Therefore, the value of the 8 shares after the second year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72 \]

The final value of all Maria's shares is:

\[ \$72 \]"
"Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate \(2 \times 3 = 6\) hot dogs.

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate \(6 \div 2 = 3\) hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate: \(3 - 2 = 1\).

John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke."
"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group will then have \( x - 10 \) students.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can write the equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group, therefore, has:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( C \) represent the number of cows and \( H \) represent the number of chickens. According to the problem, Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so we can write:
\[ H = 2C \]

We also know that the total number of animals is 60, so:
\[ C + H = 60 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know there are 20 cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times C) + (2 \times H) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times 20) + (2 \times 40) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is:
160"
"Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. After 4 weeks, he will be juggling:

3 (initial balls) + 4 (balls added each week for 4 weeks) = 7 balls

However, during the performance, he drops 3 balls. So, the number of balls he has left is:

7 - 3 = 4 balls

But 2 of those dropped balls are caught by people in the crowd, so he regains 2 balls:

4 + 2 = 6 balls

Unfortunately, 1 ball is lost completely, so he ends up with:

6 - 1 = 5 balls

Therefore, Josh starts to juggle on stage with 5 balls."
"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, so:
   - Blue beetle = 50 pounds
   - Green toad = 50 pounds

2. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so:
   - Yellow snake = 50 + 10 = 60 pounds

3. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so:
   - Red bird = 50 - 20 = 30 pounds

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the container itself, which weighs 20 pounds.

Total weight = Weight of pink frog + Weight of blue beetle + Weight of green toad + Weight of yellow snake + Weight of red bird + Weight of container
Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20
Total weight = 260 pounds

The total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, plus the container itself, is 260 pounds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits.
2. At her baby shower, Laurel received twice the amount of new baby outfits, which means she received \(2 \times 24 = 48\) new baby outfits.
3. Laurel's mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits.

Now, let's add all the outfits together:

- Outfits from her friend: 24
- Outfits from the baby shower: 48
- Outfits from her mom: 15

Total number of outfits = \(24 + 48 + 15 = 87\)

So, Laurel has 87 baby outfits in total."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the additional distance Tyson should run each day according to his coach's advice.
2. Determine the total distance Tyson runs each day after following the coach's advice.
3. Calculate the total distance Tyson runs in June, assuming June has 30 days.

Step 1: Calculate the additional distance.
Tyson runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more. So, the additional distance is:
\[ 5000 \times \frac{1}{5} = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

Step 2: Determine the total distance Tyson runs each day after following the coach's advice.
\[ 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters per day} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total distance Tyson runs in June.
June has 30 days, so the total distance is:
\[ 6000 \times 30 = 180,000 \text{ meters} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June is 180,000 meters."
"To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, let's first determine the prices of each juice box:

1. Juice Box A is priced at $4.
2. Juice Box B is $5 more than Juice Box A, so it is priced at $4 + $5 = $9.
3. Juice Box C is $7 more than Juice Box A, so it is priced at $4 + $7 = $11.

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C:

$11 (Juice Box C) - $9 (Juice Box B) = $2.

Juice Box C is $2 more than Juice Box B."
"To calculate the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have, we need to multiply the number of tables by the number of legs each type of table has and then add the results together.

For the 40 tables with 4 legs each:
40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs

For the 50 tables with 3 legs each:
50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs

Now, we add the two results together:
160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs

The total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Jenny's son takes for his lunch each week:

\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cookies Jenny's husband eats in a week:

\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 7 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Now, we add the cookies taken by her son and her husband to find out how many cookies are taken out of the total each week:

\[ 20 \text{ cookies/week} + 7 \text{ cookies/week} = 27 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Since Jenny buys a bag of 36 cookies each week, we subtract the cookies taken by her son and husband from the total to find out how many cookies Jenny eats:

\[ 36 \text{ cookies/week} - 27 \text{ cookies/week} = 9 \text{ cookies/week} \]

So, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount:

   - Daily earnings from tractors: \(10 \times 100 = \$1000\)

2. **Daily earnings from silos:**
   - Number of silos sold per day: 5
   - Price per silo: $220
   - Daily earnings from silos: \(5 \times 220 = \$1100\)

3. **Percentage increase in daily earnings:**
   - Increase in daily earnings: \(1100 - 1000 = \$100\)
   - Percentage increase: \(\frac{100}{1000} \times 100 = 10\%\)

The factory is making 10% more per day now compared to when they were making tractors."
"To calculate the total amount Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to break down the costs for each item and then sum them up for a year.

1. **Food Cost:**
   - Food costs $25 per week.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost for food is \(25 \times 4 = 100\) dollars.
   - For a year, the cost for food is \(100 \times 12 = 1200\) dollars.

2. **Treats Cost:**
   - Treats cost $20 per month.
   - For a year, the cost for treats is \(20 \times 12 = 240\) dollars.

3. **Medicine Cost:**
   - Medicine costs $100 per month.
   - For a year, the cost for medicine is \(100 \times 12 = 1200\) dollars.

Now, we sum up all the yearly costs:

Andrea saved $21."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming. He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Next, he watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is:

\[ 3 \times 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let's denote the total time spent on vacation as \( T \). Therefore, we have:

\[ 0.30T = 15 \text{ hours} \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ hours}}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. So, the time spent sightseeing is:

\[ 0.40 \times 50 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time John spent sightseeing is:

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost for Morgan and her friends to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. Then, we'll subtract this total from her budget to see how much money is left for her friends.

1. **Cost of mini-golf for one person**: $5
2. **Cost of go-karts for one person (2 rides at $10 each)**: $10 * 2 = $20
3. **Total cost for one person (mini-golf + go-karts)**: $5 + $20 = $25
4. **Total cost for one person (mini-golf + go-karts + $5 in arcade tokens)**: $25 + $5 = $30

Now, let's subtract the cost for Morgan from the total budget to find out how much is left for her friends.

5. **Morgan's budget**: $90
6. **Cost for Morgan**: $30
7. **Money left for friends**: $90 - $30 = $60

Each friend will also need $30 to cover the same activities. So, we divide the remaining money by the cost per friend to find out how many friends can be invited.

"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: \(75 + 100 - 50 = 125\) miles

So, the total distance for one trip is \(75 + 100 + 125 = 300\) miles.

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance traveled is \(300 \times 3 = 900\) miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily distance traveled:

\[
\frac{18000}{900} = 20
\]

Therefore, the train goes 20 days between services."
"First, let's determine the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed. The collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

A Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing, and a chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing. The average is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

For the chihuahua beds:
\[
4 \text{ beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per bed} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

For the collie beds:
\[
3 \text{ beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per bed} = 15 \text{ pounds}

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on her third test to pass.

The minimum number of points she must score on the third test to pass is 9."
"First, let's determine the number of people kicked out for shoplifting. We know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks. The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times that number minus 5. So, we calculate:

\[ 4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

Next, we calculate the number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. This number is three times the number of shoplifters:

\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we know the total number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence over goods on sale. Adding these together, we get:

\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

If the total number of people kicked out is 50, then the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:

\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Sara's current score is 8 points.
2. After scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times more points than Sara.

First, we calculate Erin's current score:
- Erin's current score = 3 * Sara's score = 3 * 8 = 24 points.

Now, we know that Erin's current score is 24 points, and this is after she scored 14 points. To find out how many points Erin had before scoring those 14 points, we subtract 14 from her current score:
- Erin's previous score = Erin's current score - 14 = 24 - 14 = 10 points.

Therefore, Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points.

"To calculate the total cost for the senior gifts, we need to break down the expenses into several parts:

1. **Cost of picture frames for all seniors:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - There are 44 seniors.
   - Total cost for picture frames = 44 * $20 = $880.

2. **Cost of etching the logo on each picture frame:**
   - The etching cost is 20% of the picture frame cost.
   - 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4.
   - Total etching cost for 44 seniors = 44 * $4 = $176.

3. **Cost of pins for 2 seniors:**
   - Each pin costs $5.
   - Total cost for pins = 2 * $5 = $10.

4. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers.
   - Number of officers = 44 * 1/4 = 11.
   - Each cord costs $12.
   - Total cost for cords = 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we add all these costs together to find the total amount spent:

- Total cost = Cost of picture frames + Cost of etching + Cost of pins + Cost of cords

The market price of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400.

20% of $400 is calculated as:
\[ 400 \times \frac{20}{100} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

So, Ethan would save $80 by making his own wallpaper.

The total cost for Ethan to make his own wallpaper would be:
\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday, which is:
\[ 14 \times 2 = 28 \text{ pairs} \]

On the last day of the sale, they sold one-half the amount that they did on Saturday, which is:
\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ pairs} \]

However, six pairs were returned because they didn't fit, so the actual number of pairs sold on the last day is:
\[ 14 - 6 = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

To find the total number of pairs sold during the sale, we add the pairs sold on each day:
\[ 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \text{ pairs} \]

Therefore, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is:
50 pairs."
"To find out how many hours Hallie had dance practice in a week, we need to add up the hours from each day she practiced.

- On Tuesdays, she had 1 hour of dance practice.
- On Thursdays, she had 2 hours of dance practice.
- On Saturdays, she had dance practice that lasted twice as long as Tuesday's class, which means 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

Now, we add these hours together:

1 (Tuesday) + 2 (Thursday) + 2 (Saturday) = 5 hours

So, Hallie had 5 hours of dance practice in a week.

5 hours"
"First, we need to determine the value of the faulty pieces of equipment. Since 40% of the total equipment is faulty, we calculate 40% of $400,000:

\[ 0.40 \times 400,000 = 160,000 \]

This means the faulty pieces of equipment are worth $160,000. Therefore, the value of the functioning pieces of equipment is the total value minus the value of the faulty pieces:

\[ 400,000 - 160,000 = 240,000 \]

So, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is:

\[ \boxed{240000} \]"
"Mary has 30 sheep, half of which produce 1 kg of milk and the other half produce 2 kg of milk every day.

- Half of 30 sheep is 15 sheep.
- 15 sheep produce 1 kg of milk each, so they produce a total of \(15 \times 1 = 15\) kg of milk.
- The other 15 sheep produce 2 kg of milk each, so they produce a total of \(15 \times 2 = 30\) kg of milk.

Adding the milk from both groups of sheep, Mary collects \(15 + 30 = 45\) kg of milk every day.

45 kg"
"Mrs. Sherman initially made a dozen bread rolls, which is 12 rolls.

After feeding her 6 children, 12 - 6 = 6 rolls remained.

She broke each of the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces.

48 pieces"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. There are 40 pupils in total.
2. Half of the class likes blue, so \( \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \) pupils like blue.
3. This leaves \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) pupils.
4. One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so \( \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \) pupils like green.
5. The rest like yellow, so the number of pupils who like yellow is \( 20 - 5 = 15 \).

Therefore, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is 15."
"First, let's determine how many apples Lucy sold on Monday. Since she got $56 from selling the apples at $4 per piece, we can calculate the number of apples sold on Monday as follows:

\[ \text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{\$56}{\$4 \text{ per apple}} = 14 \text{ apples} \]

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday, which means:

\[ \text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples} \]

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days by adding the apples picked on each day:

\[ \text{Total apples picked} = 14 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 24 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 50 \text{ apples} \]

Therefore, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is:

\[ 50 \]"
"Lindsay started with 50 socks. She washed 10 pairs of socks, which is 20 socks, and 15 loose socks. So, she washed a total of 20 + 15 = 35 socks. 

To find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we subtract the number of socks she washed from the total number of socks she had initially:

50 - 35 = 15

Lindsay has missed 15 socks."
"Rachel initially had 23 cookies. Janet gave her 42 more cookies, so she then had:

\[23 + 42 = 65\]

Therefore, Rachel has 21 cookies left."
"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest over the five months. The interest rate is 10% per year, so for five months, the interest rate is:

\[ \text{Interest rate for 5 months} = \frac{10\% \times 5}{12} = \frac{10}{12}\% = \frac{10}{1200} = \frac{1}{120} \]

Now, we calculate the interest on the principal amount of $3,650:

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times \frac{1}{120} = 30.4167 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 30.4167 = 3680.4167 \]

Since she has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3680.4167}{5} = 736.08334 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:

\[ \boxed{736.08} \]"
"To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Cho hiked = 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 km

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Chloe hiked = 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 km

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
Difference = Distance Cho hiked - Distance Chloe hiked
Difference = 112 km - 45 km = 67 km

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"First, let's determine the amount of silver and gold pesos Anna has.

- Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel. Since Axel has 50 silver pesos, Anna has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos.
- Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel. Since Axel has 80 gold pesos, Anna has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos they have together.

- Total silver pesos: Axel's 50 silver pesos + Anna's 100 silver pesos = \(50 + 100 = 150\) silver pesos.
- Total gold pesos: Axel's 80 gold pesos + Anna's 120 gold pesos = \(80 + 120 = 200\) gold pesos.

Finally, we add the total silver and gold pesos to find the total number of pesos they have together.

- Total number of pesos: \(150 + 200 = 350\).

The total number of pesos they have together is 350."
"First, let's determine the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She has 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. Therefore, the total number of cups of lemonade she can make is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to subtract the cost of the supplies from the total revenue to find the profit. The cost of the supplies is $18, so the profit is:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she can sell all 36 cups, we need to determine how many hours it will take her to sell all the lemonade. The total time to sell all the lemonade is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the total hours:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

Therefore, the profit Millie will make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:

\[ \$2 \]"
"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he kept \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land. The amount of land he kept is given as 12.8 hectares.

So, we can write the equation as:
\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( \frac{5}{2} \):
\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]
\[ x = 32 \]

Therefore, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 52 * 50% = 52 * 0.5 = 26

The performance is done by the female members, so initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform. However, on the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

Number of girls who can't make it = 26 * 0.5 = 13

So, the number of girls who actually perform is:

Number of girls who perform = 26 - 13 = 13

Additionally, 3 teachers decide to sing with the girls. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Total number of people who sang = Number of girls who perform + Number of teachers = 13 + 3 = 16

Final numerical answer:
16"

$12 + $24 = $36

Therefore, the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is $36."
"James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson.

To find out how many messages he delivers to Mr. Yu, we calculate 1/3 of 66:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

So, James delivers 22 messages to Mr. Yu.

To find the total number of messages delivered, we add the messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu:
\[ 66 + 22 = 88 \]

Therefore, the total number of messages James delivers is 88."
"To determine how much money David saves, let's break down the costs for both David and Dasha.

**David's Cost:**
- David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.

**Dasha's Cost:**
- Dasha buys tickets for each ride. Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost per ride for Dasha is \(2 \times 2 = $4\).
- Since Dasha rides all 9 rides, her total cost is \(9 \times 4 = $36\).

**Total Cost for Both:**
- David's total cost: $30
- Dasha's total cost: $36
- Combined total cost: \(30 + 36 = $66\)

**David's Savings:**
- If Dasha had bought a ride bracelet instead of buying individual tickets, her cost would have been $30.
- The difference in cost between Dasha buying individual tickets and a bracelet is \(36 - 30 = $6\).
- Since David bought the bracelet, he saves the $6 that Dasha would have spent on individual tickets.

Therefore, David saves $6."
"First, let's calculate the total number of gifts Monica needs to wrap:

- Gifts for her family: 6
- Gifts for her friends: 4
- Gifts for her teachers: 2

Total number of gifts = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to make bows for all 12 gifts. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each bow, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of gifts:

144 inches of ribbon ÷ 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given ratio and the total number of popsicles to find out how many popsicles each person has.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. Together, they have 11 parts (5 + 6) of the total popsicles.

Given that the total number of popsicles is 165, we can set up the following equation to find the value of one part:

\[ 11 \text{ parts} = 165 \text{ popsicles} \]

To find the value of one part, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:

\[ 1 \text{ part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \text{ popsicles} \]

Now, we can find out how many popsicles Betty and Sam have individually:

- Betty has 5 parts, so:
\[ 5 \text{ parts} = 5 \times 15 = 75 \text{ popsicles} \]

- Sam has 6 parts, so:
\[ 6 \text{ parts} = 6 \times 15 = 90 \text{ popsicles} \]

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services before the bundle discount:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu costs $10 a month.
- Disney Plus costs $10 a month.

So, the total cost for these three services before the discount is:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, since Tim gets a 20% discount for bundling these services, we need to calculate the discount amount and the final cost after the discount:

- The discount on the total cost is 20%, so the discount amount is:
\[ 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

- The final cost after the discount is:
\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we compare this to the cost of the cable package, which is $60 per month. The savings by cancelling the cable package and subscribing to the streaming services is:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's break down the time Carol spends on each activity:

1. Writing a song: 4 hours
2. Recording: half the time spent writing, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) hours
3. Editing: 90 minutes, which is \( \frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \) hours

Now, let's calculate the total work time:

Total work time = Time spent writing + Time spent recording + Time spent editing
Total work time = 4 hours + 2 hours + 1.5 hours
Total work time = 7.5 hours

Next, we calculate the percentage of the total work time that was spent editing:

Percentage of time spent editing = \( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total work time}} \times 100 \)
Percentage of time spent editing = \( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \times 100 \)
Percentage of time spent editing = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 100 \)
Percentage of time spent editing = 20%

Therefore, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing the song."

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry \(\boxed{92}\) books to complete her task."
"First, let's calculate the total number of Valentine's cards Erica initially had:

- Erica made 20 cards.
- Her dad brought 2 boxes with 15 cards each, so that's \(2 \times 15 = 30\) cards.

Adding these together, Erica started with \(20 + 30 = 50\) cards.

Next, we account for the cards she passed out and received:

- She passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
- She passed out 5 cards to her family.
- She received 17 cards from family and friends.

So, the total number of cards she gave away is \(24 + 5 = 29\), and the total number of cards she received is 17.

Now, we can calculate the final number of cards Erica has:

Initial cards: 50
Cards given away: 29
Cards received: 17

Final number of cards = Initial cards - Cards given away + Cards received
\[ 50 - 29 + 17 = 38 \]

So, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards."

"First, let's calculate the number of millipedes Nancy saw. Since she saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, and she saw 90 spiders, the number of millipedes is:

\[ \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \]

Next, we calculate the number of stink bugs. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12:

\[ \text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \]

Now, we add up all the bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of bugs} = \text{Number of spiders} + \text{Number of millipedes} + \text{Number of stink bugs} \]

"First, let's calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when it is used for 8 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. Therefore, for 8 hours, it uses:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the daily energy consumption to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Now, if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, the air conditioner will be used for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

The energy consumption for 3 hours a day is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Therefore, the total kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:
\[ 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]"

"To determine how much money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sandwiches needed to serve 20 people.
2. Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.
3. Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of sandwiches needed.**
Each sandwich serves 4 people. Therefore, the number of sandwiches needed for 20 people is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.**
Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of meat and cheese needed is:
\[ 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of meat per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \]
\[ 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of cheese per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese.**
The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound, and the cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound. Therefore, the total cost for the meat and cheese is:
\[ 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \times \$7.00 \text{ per pound} = \$35.00 \]
\[ 5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \times \$3.00 \text{ per pound} = \$15.00 \]

1. Allan has 40 cannolis.
2. There is twice as much corn as cannolis, so he has \(2 \times 40 = 80\) corns.
3. Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so now he has \(40 + 60 = 100\) cannolis.
4. He bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought, so he bought \(60 - 40 = 20\) corns. Therefore, he now has \(80 + 20 = 100\) corns.

Now, we need to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis:

\[100 \text{ (cannolis)} + 100 \text{ (corns)} = 200\]

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 200."
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, let's break down the information given:

1. Elliott aims to walk 10,000 steps a day.
2. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. So, he walked 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.
3. He did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
4. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take.

First, let's calculate the total steps he had completed before his jog:
- Steps from walking to and from school: 5,000
- Steps from the short walk with his friend: 1,000
- Total steps before the jog: 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after his jog, the total steps he aimed to take (10,000) minus the steps he had already taken (6,000) and the steps he had left (2,000) will give us the steps he took during his jog:
- Steps taken during the jog: 10,000 - 6,000 - 2,000 = 2,000

Therefore, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog."
"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:

\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we determine how long it will take Toby to read the book at his reading rate of 300 words per minute:

\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to leave, and it takes him 30 minutes to read the book. After reading, he needs to travel to the airport, which takes 10 minutes. So, the total time he will spend is:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes (reading)} + 10 \text{ minutes (travel)} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he has 60 minutes before he needs to leave, the time he will be early is:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total payment for May.
2. Determine the number of employees remaining after June.
3. Calculate the total payment for June.
4. Sum the payments from May and June.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**

- Number of employees in May: 40
- Payment per employee per hour: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment for May = Number of employees × Payment per employee per hour × Hours worked per week
\[ 40 \times 15 \times 40 = 24000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of employees remaining after June.**

- 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired in June.
- Number of employees who left = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \)
- Number of employees remaining = 40 - 10 = 30

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for June.**

- Number of employees in June: 30
- Payment per employee per hour: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment for June = Number of employees × Payment per employee per hour × Hours worked per week
\[ 30 \times 15 \times 40 = 18000 \]

**Step 4: Sum the payments from May and June.**

Total payment for May and June = Payment for May + Payment for June
\[ 24000 + 18000 = 42000 \]

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $42,000."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. This means that for 2 pounds of taffy, Sally pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (since it's half off).

The cost of the taffy is:
\[ \$3 + \$1.50 = \$4.50 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50, and the magnets cost $0.25 each. Since she bought 4 magnets, the total cost for the magnets is:
\[ 4 \times \$0.25 = \$1.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the seashells and the magnets to the cost of the taffy:
\[ \$4.50 + \$1.50 + \$1.00 = \$7.00 \]

Sally started with $10. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from the amount she started with:
\[ \$10.00 - \$7.00 = \$3.00 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Sally has left is:
\[ \$3.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the second pack of fireworks. It's worth twice the amount of the first pack, which is $400. So, the second pack costs:

\[ 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

Next, we add the cost of the first and second packs to find the total cost before the discount:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Tim gets a 20% discount on these fireworks. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $1200:

\[ 0.20 \times 1200 = 240 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost of the fireworks to find the discounted price:

\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted price of the fireworks:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

So, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. To find out how many cookies she needs for 30 days, we multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of days:

\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies she needs to make 60 cookies:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

5 dozens"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the problem does not provide a direct percentage for candles that explode. Instead, it gives us a guarantee that the candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which implies that 1% of the candles might explode.

Given that 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog, we can assume that these 5% are a subset of the candles that might explode. But since the problem does not specify the overlap between the candles that explode and those that smell like wet dog, we can only calculate the number of candles that smell like wet dog based on the given information.

First, let's calculate the number of candles that smell like wet dog:
- 5% of the 50,000 candles smell like wet dog.
\[ 0.05 \times 50000 = 2500 \]

Since the problem does not provide information on the overlap between the candles that smell like wet dog and those that explode, we cannot determine the exact number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, based on the information given, the number of candles that smell like wet dog is 2500.

Final numerical answer:
2500"
"First, we need to calculate the discounted price of each blouse. Since the blouses are on a 30% off rack, we subtract 30% from the regular price of $20.

The discount amount per blouse is:
\[ 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

So, the discounted price per blouse is:
\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost for the 4 blouses is:
\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
\[ 56 \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples.
3. Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as \(x\).

Joanne's total apples = \(30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\).

Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
Joanne's sister gathers no apples from the average trees.

Joanne's sister's total apples = \(60 + 45 = 105\).

The combined total of apples gathered by both is 500.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[45 + x + 105 = 500\]

Simplifying the left side:
\[150 + x = 500\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[x = 500 - 150\]
\[x = 350\]

Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

**Final numerical answer:**
350"
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads is 180, which means \( C + D = 180 \).
2. The total number of humps is 304, which means \( 2C + D = 304 \) because camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump.

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can express \( D \) from the first equation:
\[ D = 180 - C \]

Next, we substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[ 2C + (180 - C) = 304 \]
\[ 2C + 180 - C = 304 \]
\[ C + 180 = 304 \]
\[ C = 304 - 180 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we know \( C = 124 \), we can find \( D \):
\[ D = 180 - C \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

Final numerical answer:
56"
"First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days:
\[ 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we calculate the distance he traveled over the next two days, which is 30% of the distance traveled in the first four days:
\[ 800 \, \text{km} \times 0.30 = 240 \, \text{km} \]

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is:
\[ 0 \, \text{km} \]

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days:
\[ 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we sum up all the distances:
\[ 800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} = 3140 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ 3140 \, \text{km} \]"
"Given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4.

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.

\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to determine the elevation of the comb and then calculate the difference between that elevation and Oliver's current elevation.

1. Stanley's comb fell 4,000 feet from his starting elevation of 10,000 feet.
   - Elevation of the comb = 10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet.

2. Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet.

3. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb:
   - Climbing distance = Elevation of the comb - Oliver's current elevation
   - Climbing distance = 6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet.

Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To determine how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money given by the second bank.
2. Add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital.

The first bank gave Mr. Josue $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Now, we add the amounts from both banks to his initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

So, the final amount of capital Mr. Josue has now is:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so the total number of cats carried away by the boats is:

4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats

After the boats carried away the cats, the number of cats left on the rock is:

50 cats - 20 cats = 30 cats

Then, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. The number of cats that ran after the mouse is:

(3/5) * 30 cats = 18 cats

The number of cats left on the rock after 18 cats ran after the mouse is:

30 cats - 18 cats = 12 cats

Therefore, the final number of cats left on the rock is:

12 cats"
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into the different pricing periods.

1. **First 6 months at $8 a month:**
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 a month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96
   \]

3. **The remaining 10 months (since 2 years is 24 months, and 6 + 8 = 14 months, so 24 - 14 = 10 months) at $14 a month:**
   \[
   10 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$140
   \]

Now, we add up all these costs to get the total cost for 2 years:
\[
\$48 + \$96 + \$140 = \$284

"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The problem states that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out the total savings Cole made. The problem states that he saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can set up the following equations:

Let \( S_{tattered} \) be the savings from the tattered jeans and \( S_{jogger} \) be the savings from the jogger jeans. We know:

\[ S_{tattered} + S_{jogger} = 6 \]
\[ S_{jogger} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
\[ S_{tattered} = 6 - 2 = 4 \]

The original price of the jogger jeans is $22, and the sale price is $22 - $2 = $20. The original price of the tattered jeans is $28, and the sale price is $28 - $4 = $24. 

To find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we need to calculate the difference between their original prices:

\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans."
"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles rented.

First, we calculate the capacity of the 4 buses:
\[ 4 \text{ buses} \times 60 \text{ employees per bus} = 240 \text{ employees} \]

Next, we calculate the capacity of the 6 minibusses:
\[ 6 \text{ minibusses} \times 30 \text{ employees per minibus} = 180 \text{ employees} \]

Then, we calculate the capacity of the 10 minivans:
\[ 10 \text{ minivans} \times 15 \text{ employees per minivan} = 150 \text{ employees} \]

Finally, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles to get the total number of employees that can join the day trip:
\[ 240 \text{ employees} + 180 \text{ employees} + 150 \text{ employees} = 570 \text{ employees} \]

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is:

"First, let's break down the information given:

- Lillian builds 3 bird feeders.
- She buys 3 bird feeders.
- Each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds.
- Each homemade feeder attracts 10 more birds than a store-bought feeder, so each homemade feeder attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds.

Now, let's calculate the total number of birds attracted by each type of feeder:

- For the 3 store-bought feeders: 3 feeders * 20 birds/feeder = 60 birds.
- For the 3 homemade feeders: 3 feeders * 30 birds/feeder = 90 birds.

Adding these together gives the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day:

60 birds (from store-bought feeders) + 90 birds (from homemade feeders) = 150 birds.

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day."
"To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. **Bagel Cost**: The bagel costs $4.

2. **Soup Cost**: The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find the cost of the soup, we calculate 25% of $4 and add it to the original price of the bagel.
   - 25% of $4 = 0.25 * $4 = $1
   - Therefore, the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.

3. **Cake Cost**: The cake costs half of the price of the bagel.
   - Half of $4 = $4 / 2 = $2

Now, we sum up the costs of the soup, bagel, and cake to find the total cost of the dinner.
- Total cost = Cost of soup + Cost of bagel + Cost of cake
- Total cost = $5 + $4 + $2 = $11

Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money Kenny has after selling his cards:**
   - Kenny has $50 in spending cash and the ticket to the amusement park costs $100, so the total amount of money he has after buying the ticket is $50 + $100 = $150.

2. **Calculate the number of cards sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5, so the number of cards sold is $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards.

3. **Determine the total number of cards Kenny started with:**
   - Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells the rest. This means that the 100 cards he sold represent 2/3 of his total collection.
   - To find the total number of cards, we can set up the equation: \( \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Total Cards} = 100 \).
   - Solving for the total number of cards, we get: \( \text{Total Cards} = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150 \).

Therefore, Kenny started with 150 cards."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation**: The caterer prepared enough hot dogs for half of the 36 guests to have two hot dogs each. So, half of 36 is 18 guests. This means 18 guests were supposed to have 2 hot dogs each, which totals 36 hot dogs for these guests.

2. **Total Hot Dogs Needed**: Since 18 guests were supposed to have 2 hot dogs each, the caterer prepared 36 hot dogs for these guests. The remaining 18 guests were supposed to have 1 hot dog each, so the caterer prepared an additional 18 hot dogs for them. Therefore, the total number of hot dogs prepared was 36 (for the first 18 guests) + 18 (for the remaining 18 guests) = 54 hot dogs.

3. **Actual Guests and Hot Dogs Needed**: When 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog, we need to calculate the total number of hot dogs required. The first 18 guests would still want 2 hot dogs each, which is 36 hot dogs. The remaining 22 guests (40 total guests - 18 guests who already had 2 hot dogs) would each want 1 more hot dog, which is 22 more hot dogs. So, the total number of hot dogs needed is 36 (for the first 18 guests) + 22 (for the remaining 22 guests) = 58 hot dogs.

4. **Hot Dogs Shortage**: The caterer only prepared 54 hot dogs, but 58 were needed. Therefore, the shortage is 58 - 54 = 4 hot dogs.

5. **Guests Without Second Hot Dog**: Since 4 hot dogs are short, 4 out of the 40 guests did not get a second hot dog.

**Final Answer**: 4 guests did not get a second hot dog."
"First, we determine the number of letters in half of Indras' name. Indras' name has 6 letters, so half of that is:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we find out how many letters are in her sister's name. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, so:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, we add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name together:

\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Set of mixing bowls: $20.00
- 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Now, add these amounts together to get the total before the discount:

$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Next, calculate the discount. Since everything is 20% off, we need to find 20% of $165.00:

20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Now, subtract the discount from the total to find the final cost:

$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

Therefore, Charlotte's order was $132.00."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy:

- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, let's calculate how much money Dora has:

- Saved from allowance: $2
- Money given by her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, to find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the total money she has from the total cost of the items:

$19 (total cost) - $18 (total money Dora has) = $1

Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more."

"First, we need to determine how much gasoline is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needs in gallons. Josey needs \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons by 8:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"First, let's calculate how much money George had left after his purchase. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Money left} = 5 \times 0.01 = 0.05 \]

So, George spent:

\[ 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \]

Next, we know George bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each. The total cost for the chips is:

\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \]

Subtracting the cost of the chips from the total amount spent gives us the amount spent on candy bars:

\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars George bought is:

\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars."
"Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, the number of lollipops he shared with his friends is:

20 ÷ 4 = 5 lollipops

Each of his friends received 5 lollipops."
"Rory's cake weighs 20 ounces in total and is cut into 8 pieces. If Rory and her mom each have one piece, that means 2 pieces are eaten. Since the cake was divided equally into 8 pieces, each piece weighs:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} \]

So, the weight of the 2 pieces eaten is:

\[ 2 \times 2.5 \text{ ounces} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the remaining weight of the cake is:

\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have together:

Next, we need to determine how many people will be sharing these oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing the oranges with 6 other friends, so the total number of people sharing the oranges is:
\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

Now, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people to find out how many oranges each person will get:
\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, each person will get 7 oranges. 

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine will use. He doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. Therefore, he will use:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the cost for the onions will be:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is on sale for $2.00. Therefore, the cost for the beef stock will be:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to find the total cost of the ingredients:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Therefore, the cost per serving is:

\[ \$2.00 \]"
"Wayne's drive to the theater takes 4 minutes. Since Bernadette's drive takes four times as long, her drive takes \(4 \times 4 = 16\) minutes.

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to leave 5 minutes earlier than Wayne's departure time. However, the question asks how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne to get to the theater first, which means we need to account for her longer travel time.

If Wayne leaves at time \(T\), he will arrive at \(T + 4\) minutes. Bernadette needs to arrive at \(T + 4 - 5 = T - 1\) to be 5 minutes early for Wayne. Since Bernadette's drive takes 16 minutes, she needs to leave at \(T - 1 - 16 = T - 17\).

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area of the room to find the width. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the room. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"To determine how many more beads one sister has than the other, we first need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, Elizabeth's total is:
\[ 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

Margareth's total is:
\[ 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we find the difference in the number of beads between Margareth and Elizabeth:
\[ 140 - 60 = 80 \]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking**: Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour.
   - Temperature increase per hour = 5 degrees
   - Total hours baking = 3 hours
   - Total temperature increase = 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees
   - New temperature after baking = 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

3. **Cooling**: Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   - Cooling rate = 2 degrees/10 minutes
   - Total time the window is open = 30 minutes
   - Total cooling = (2 degrees/10 minutes) * 30 minutes = 6 degrees
   - Final temperature = 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

The house's final temperature is 49 degrees."
"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon:

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time James took for the swim is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so:

\[ 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's:

\[ 170 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we can find out how long it took James to do the run by subtracting the time he took for the swim and the bike from his total time:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} - 85 \text{ minutes} = 59 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it took James 59 minutes to do the run."
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C into minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is:

\[ 1.25 \times 60 = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so:

\[ \text{Length of Movie B} = 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, so:

\[ \text{Length of Movie A} = \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Movie A was 20 minutes long."
"First, let's determine how far the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the distance the horse runs is:
\[ 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate how much hay the horse eats. For every mile, the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse eats:
\[ 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails of hay} \]

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost for 8 bails of hay is:
\[ 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

The change Michael has after buying the hay is:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has:

- She uses 4 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen equals \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs.
- She also uses 2 additional eggs.

So, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Since each glass requires 5 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 5:

\[
\frac{50}{5} = 10 \text{ glasses}
\]

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays she can put out:

\[
\frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ trays}
\]

Therefore, Rozanne can put out 2 trays."
"To determine by how many points Joey is now winning, we need to calculate the total points for both Joey and Marcy after their respective turns and then find the difference between their scores.

1. Joey's initial points: 214
   Joey's points after his turn: 214 + 26 = 240

2. Marcy's initial points: 225
   Marcy's points after her turn: 225 + 10 = 235

3. Calculate the difference between Joey's and Marcy's points:
   Joey's points - Marcy's points = 240 - 235 = 5

Joey is now winning by 5 points."
"To calculate the salesman's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per sneaker.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the sneakers.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost per sneaker.**

The total cost for the case of sneakers is $576, and there are 48 sneakers in the case. So, the cost per sneaker is:
\[ \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the sneakers.**

- The salesman sold 17 sneakers at $20 each on Monday. So, the revenue from these sales is:
\[ 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars} \]

- The remaining sneakers are \(48 - 17 = 31\). These were sold at $25 each. So, the revenue from these sales is:
\[ 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars} \]

- The total revenue from all sales is:
\[ 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit.**

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ \text{Profit} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the salesman's profit is:
\[ \boxed{539} \]"
"To find the total number of crayons Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of crayons in each type of packet and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets that each contain 8 pieces:
\[ 6 \times 8 = 48 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of crayons in the four packets that each contain 16 pieces:
\[ 4 \times 16 = 64 \]

Now, we add the two totals together to find the overall number of crayons:
\[ 48 + 64 = 112 \]

Therefore, the total number of crayons Beatrice bought is:
\[ 112 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Super Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $20
   - Popcorn with soda: $1 extra
   - Total cost with super ticket: $20 + $1 = $21

2. **Regular Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $12
   - Popcorn: Let's call the regular price of popcorn \( P \)
   - Soda: $3
   - Total cost without super ticket: $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \)

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - Therefore, the cost of the regular ticket option minus the cost of the super ticket option equals $2.
   - \( ($15 + P) - $21 = $2 \)

4. **Solve for \( P \):**
   - \( $15 + P - $21 = $2 \)
   - \( P - $6 = $2 \)
   - \( P = $2 + $6 \)
   - \( P = $8 \)

The regular price of the popcorn is $8.

**Final Answer:**
The regular price of the popcorn is $8."
"First, let's determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the initial day. Given that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900, we can calculate the cost per balloon as follows:

\[ \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{\$900}{20} = \$45 \]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = \$45 + \$20 = \$65 \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost for Bentley to fill 170 balloons at the new price:

\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times \$65 = \$11,050 \]

So, Bentley paid \(\$11,050\) to fill 170 balloons after the price increase."
"To find the car's average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

1. For the first part of the trip:

   - Time = 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles

2. For the second part of the trip:
   - Speed = 30 mph
   - Time = 1 hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 1 hour = 30 miles

3. Total distance traveled = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

4. Total time taken = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

5. Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."

"First, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed. The volume of a raised bed is given by its width, length, and height:

\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume of soil} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{\$/bag} = 1920 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, the potting soil will cost Bob $1920."
"First, let's calculate the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, and there are 15 red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = 15 (red cards) + 60% of 15
Number of green cards = 15 + (0.60 * 15)
Number of green cards = 15 + 9
Number of green cards = 24

Next, we calculate the number of yellow cards. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24
Number of yellow cards = 39

Now, to find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards together:

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39
Total number of cards = 78

Therefore, the total number of cards of all mentioned colors is 78."
"Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. After twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies join, which is:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

So, the total number of fairies became:

\[ 50 + 25 = 75 \]

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away, so the number of fairies remaining is:

\[ 75 - 30 = 45 \]

Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is 45."
"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

Total number of puppies = 8 (Jennifer's) + 12 (Brandon's) = 20 puppies
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 (Jennifer's) + 4 (Brandon's) = 7 puppies

Now, to find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.35 \times 100 = 35\% \]

Therefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots."
"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to make, we first need to calculate the total weight of all the feed he is buying.

1. **Hay**: 42 bales at 75 pounds each
   \[
   42 \times 75 = 3150 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Oats**: 20 sacks at 65 pounds each
   \[
   20 \times 65 = 1300 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Carrots**: 4 bags at 12 pounds each
   \[
   4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Sugar cubes**: 2 boxes at 1 pound each
   \[
   2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Now, we add up all the weights:
\[
3150 + 1300 + 48 + 2 = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since a fraction of a trip would still require a full trip):
\[
\frac{4500}{2250} = 2
\]

Therefore, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."
"To calculate how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to first determine her weekly earnings from recycling cans and bottles, and then multiply that by four.

1. **Aluminum Cans:**
   - Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week.
   - Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
   - Weekly earnings from cans = 3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week.

2. **Plastic Bottles:**
   - Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week.
   - Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
   - Weekly earnings from bottles = 5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week.

3. **Total Weekly Earnings:**
   - Total weekly earnings = Earnings from cans + Earnings from bottles
   - Total weekly earnings = 6 cents/week + 15 cents/week = 21 cents/week.

4. **Total Monthly Earnings:**
   - There are 4 weeks in the month.
   - Total monthly earnings = Total weekly earnings * 4 weeks
   - Total monthly earnings = 21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents.

Therefore, Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month."
"First, let's determine how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

\[ \text{Toni's plants} = \text{Frederick's plants} + 0.60 \times \text{Frederick's plants} \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 0.60 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 16 \]

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate the number of plants Shondra has as follows:

\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = \text{Toni's plants} - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 16 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 9 \]

Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants."

"To find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we first need to calculate the tip, which is 1/5 of the amount she ordered. Since the pizza costs $15, the tip would be:

\[ \text{Tip} = \frac{1}{5} \times 15 = 3 \]

Now, we add the tip to the cost of the pizza to get the total amount:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Cost of Pizza} + \text{Tip} = 15 + 3 = 18 \]

Therefore, the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man is $18."
"Let's break down Finley's position changes step by step:

1. She started in first place.
2. She fell back 5 spots: \(1 - 5 = -4\). Since she can't be in a negative spot, we adjust this to the last possible positive spot, which is 5th place (since there are only 10 spots in a race of this nature, and she can't be in a negative spot).
3. She then moved ahead 2 spots: \(5 + 2 = 7\).
4. She fell behind 3 spots: \(7 - 3 = 4\).
5. Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot: \(4 + 1 = 5\).

So, Finley finished in 5th place.

"First, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has:

\[ 6 \text{ decks} \times 25 \text{ cards/deck} = 150 \text{ basketball cards} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of baseball cards:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 40 \text{ cards/box} = 200 \text{ baseball cards} \]

Now, let's find the total number of cards she has:

\[ 150 \text{ basketball cards} + 200 \text{ baseball cards} = 350 \text{ cards} \]

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is:

\[ 350 \text{ cards} - 50 \text{ cards} = 300 \text{ cards} \]

If each student gets 10 cards, the number of students is:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ cards}}{10 \text{ cards/student}} = 30 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students."
"First, let's calculate how much Becky paid for her apples.

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.45 = 9.00 \text{ dollars} \]

After receiving a $1 discount, Becky's final cost is:
\[ 9.00 - 1.00 = 8.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for her apples.

Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Kelly received a 10 percent discount on her total cost. The discount amount is:
\[ 10.00 \times 0.10 = 1.00 \text{ dollar} \]

So, Kelly's final cost after the discount is:
\[ 10.00 - 1.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we subtract Becky's final cost from Kelly's final cost:
\[ 9.00 - 8.00 = 1.00 \text{ dollar} \]

Therefore, Kelly paid $1.00 more than Becky."
"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we need to calculate the number of each type of laundry item per room and then multiply by the number of rooms.

1. **Sheets per room**: 2
2. **Comforter per room**: 1
3. **Pillow cases per room**: Since there are twice as many pillow cases as sheets, we have \(2 \times 2 = 4\)
4. **Towels per room**: Since there are twice as many towels as pillow cases, we have \(2 \times 4 = 8\)

Now, we sum up the total number of laundry items per room:
\[2 \text{ (sheets)} + 1 \text{ (comforter)} + 4 \text{ (pillow cases)} + 8 \text{ (towels)} = 15 \text{ pieces per room}\]

For 80 rooms, the total number of pieces of laundry is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.
2. On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since 1 pair equals 2 shoes, he gets 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.
3. On Wednesday, he gains 15 pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
4. On Friday, he gains 30 pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.
5. On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of shoes he has by the end of Saturday:

Starting shoes: 200
+ Monday's gain: 10
+ Wednesday's gain: 30
+ Friday's gain: 60

"To determine how many pans worth of cupcakes Mary should bake, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cupcakes Mary can decorate with all her sprinkles.
2. Determine how many pans are needed to bake that many cupcakes.

First, we know that each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes, and Mary has 6 jars. So, the total number of cupcakes she can decorate is:
\[ 6 \text{ jars} \times 8 \text{ cupcakes/jar} = 48 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Next, we know that each pan holds 12 cupcakes. To find out how many pans are needed to bake 48 cupcakes, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold:
\[ 48 \text{ cupcakes} \div 12 \text{ cupcakes/pan} = 4 \text{ pans} \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of pencils at the start of the year. There are 30 students, and each started with 10 pencils:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ pencils/student} = 300 \text{ pencils} \]

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. So, the number of pencils used is:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \text{ pencils} \]

This means the number of pencils remaining after two months is:

\[ 300 - 60 = 240 \text{ pencils} \]

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. So, the number of pencils left is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80 \text{ pencils} \]

Therefore, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is:

\[ 80 \]"

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, so we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet to match the unit of the shark's body length. There are 12 inches in a foot.

Each remora is 6 inches long, which is \( \frac{6}{12} = 0.5 \) feet long.

Since there are 2 remoras, the combined length of the remoras is \( 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \) foot.

The shark's body length is 10 feet.

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length."
"Let's denote the total number of students at that grade level as \( x \).

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home. This means that one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers.

So, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{4}x = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

\[
x = 20 \times 4 = 80
\]

Therefore, the total number of students at that grade level is 80."
"To break in the new pair of shoes, Jason needs to walk a total of 240 minutes. He plans to walk 4 days a week to achieve this goal in three weeks.

First, calculate the total number of days he will walk:
\[ 4 \text{ days/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Next, divide the total minutes needed by the total number of days to find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{12 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ minutes/day} \]

So, Jason has to spend 20 minutes walking each day."
"To find out how many books each child received, we first need to determine the total number of books Sarah bought. We can do this by dividing the total amount spent by the price per book.

Total amount spent: $300
Price per book: $15

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Price per book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Now, we need to divide the total number of books equally among her 4 kids.

Number of books each child gets = Total number of books / Number of kids
Number of books each child gets = 20 / 4
Number of books each child gets = 5

Each child got 5 books."
"To find out how many kids in Gina's class are not allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to first determine how many kids are allergic to at least one of the substances (dairy or peanuts).

Let's denote:
- \(D\) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \(P\) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

We are given:
- \(|D| = 9\)
- \(|P| = 6\)
- \(|D \cap P| = 3\)
- Total number of kids in the class, \(|U| = 32\)

The number of kids allergic to at least one of the substances is given by:
\[|D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P|\]

Substituting the given values:
\[|D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12\]

This means 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances. To find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to at least one substance from the total number of kids in the class:
\[32 - 12 = 20\]

Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to add the number of employees to the number of tour guides.

First, calculate the total number of employees:
- There are 3 groups of 200 employees each.
- Total employees = 3 groups * 200 employees/group = 600 employees.

Next, calculate the total number of tour guides:
- Each group has 7 tour guides.
- Total tour guides = 3 groups * 7 tour guides/group = 21 tour guides.

Now, add the total number of employees and tour guides to get the total number of people going on the tour:
- Total people = Total employees + Total tour guides = 600 + 21 = 621.

Therefore, the total number of people going on this tour is 621."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel during the busy weekend. The normal price is $1500 per day, and it is 20% more expensive during the busy weekend.

The increase in price is:
\[ 1500 \times 0.20 = 300 \]

So, the cost per day during the busy weekend is:
\[ 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, so for two people, it is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Adding the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel together gives the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the trip is:
\[ 15400 \]"
"Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint, which totals 7 tubes of paint.

Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, so Jasper has \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) tubes of blue paint.

Jasper also has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so Jasper has \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) tubes of yellow paint.

Therefore, the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has is \( 2 + 9 = 11 \).

Final numerical answer:
11"
"Given that the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, and the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate the weight of the 2010 penny as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \text{ grains} \]

\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = 36 \text{ grains} \]

Now, to find the combined weight of the two pennies, we add the weight of the 1959 penny and the 2010 penny:

\[ \text{Combined weight} = 48 \text{ grains} + 36 \text{ grains} \]

\[ \text{Combined weight} = 84 \text{ grains} \]

The combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains."
"To find out how much more Keegan and Tashay needed to earn to reach their goal, we first add the amounts they have already earned:

Keegan's earnings: $83
Tashay's earnings: $91

Total earned: $83 + $91 = $174

Their goal is $200, so we subtract the total earned from the goal to find out how much more they need:

$200 - $174 = $26

They need to earn $26 more to reach their goal."
"First, let's determine how many songs Luri has on her player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we can calculate the number of songs Luri has as follows:

\[ \text{Luri's songs} = 3 \times \text{Gabriel's songs} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out how many more songs each can add to their players. Since each player can hold up to 100 songs, we subtract the number of songs each currently has from 100:

For Gabriel:
\[ \text{Songs Gabriel can add} = 100 - \text{Gabriel's songs} = 100 - 20 = 80 \]

For Luri:
\[ \text{Songs Luri can add} = 100 - \text{Luri's songs} = 100 - 60 = 40 \]

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Songs Gabriel can add} - \text{Songs Luri can add} = 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Therefore, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his."
"First, we need to determine how many oranges Stetson ate. Since he ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 oranges they picked, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. Since he agreed to give $10 for each orange he eats, the total amount of money he gave up is:

\[
24 \times 10 = 240
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is $240."
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we start by identifying the cost of her shoes, which is given as $80. The problem states that the handbag costs $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes.

First, we calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes:
\[ 3 \times 80 = 240 \]

Next, we subtract $20 from this amount to find the cost of the handbag:
\[ 240 - 20 = 220 \]

Therefore, the cost of Jillian's handbag is $220."
"James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week. 

First, calculate the total miles he runs in a week:
\[ 12 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 60 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, since he runs at a pace of 10 miles per hour, we can find out how many hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles by his speed:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, James runs a total of 6 hours a week."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the daily consumption of oats for one horse:**
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, the daily consumption for one horse is \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).

2. **Determine the daily consumption of oats for all four horses:**
   - Since there are four horses, the total daily consumption is \(10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).

3. **Determine the total consumption of oats for five days:**
   - The total consumption for five days is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).

4. **Determine the number of bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.
   - The number of bags needed is \(\frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags}\).

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days."
"First, we calculate the number of Pomeranians Jana has. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of Pomeranians} = \frac{2}{3} \times 27 = 18
\]

Next, we find out how many of these Pomeranians are girls. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of girl Pomeranians} = \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
\]

Therefore, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians."
"To find the average highest temperature of these three countries, we first need to sum the highest temperatures and then divide by the number of countries.

The highest temperatures are:
- Southlandia: -48°F
- Northlandia: 21°F
- Midlandia: -3°F

Sum of the highest temperatures:
-48 + 21 + (-3) = -30°F

Now, we divide this sum by the number of countries, which is 3:
-30 / 3 = -10°F

The average highest temperature of these three countries is -10°F."
"To find out how many days it will take the child to save the remaining amount of money, we first need to calculate the remaining amount he needs to save.

The toy car costs $12, and the child already has $4 saved. So, the remaining amount he needs to save is:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

The child saves $2 daily from his allowance. To find out how many days it will take to save the remaining $8, we divide the remaining amount by the daily savings:
\[ 8 \div 2 = 4 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each tray can hold 24 eggs.
2. Jaime has 2 trays, so the total capacity of the trays is \(24 \times 2 = 48\) eggs.
3. Jaime has 64 eggs in total.

Now, to find out how many eggs won't be able to be placed on the tray, we subtract the total capacity of the trays from the total number of eggs:

\[64 - 48 = 16\]

So, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the tray."
"To find out how much Sally spends in all, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza and then add it to the cost of the small pizza.

1. The cost of the small pizza is $8.
2. The family-size pizza costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, so:
   \[ \text{Cost of family-size pizza} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 + 24 = 32 \]

Sally spends a total of $32."
"First, let's calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors before any discounts:

- Each pack costs $4.00.
- Therefore, 2 packs cost $4.00 * 2 = $8.00.

Since the razors are on sale with a ""buy one get one free"" offer, Heather only pays for one pack when she buys two. So, the cost for 2 packs is effectively the cost of 1 pack:

- Cost for 2 packs with the sale = $4.00.

Now, we apply the $2.00 coupon:

- Cost after coupon = $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Heather is buying 2 packs, which contain 4 razors each, so she is getting 8 razors in total:

- Total number of razors = 4 razors/pack * 2 packs = 8 razors.

The cost per razor is then:

- Cost per razor = Total cost / Number of razors = $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

Converting this to cents:

- $0.25 = 25 cents.

Therefore, each individual razor will cost 25 cents after the discount."
"To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to identify the height of the shortest cheerleader, as she will be at the top of the pyramid. According to the problem, 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, and the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall. Therefore, the shortest cheerleader is 60 inches tall.

The height of the human pyramid is thus the height of the shortest cheerleader, which is 60 inches.

To convert this height into feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

\[ \frac{60 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the human pyramid is 5 feet."
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour. Since she works 8 hours a day, she walks:

\[ 5 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \]

After 5 days, the total time she has walked is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, after 5 days at the office, Charisma has walked 200 minutes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be \(14 + 4 = 18\) years old.
3. At that time, Angela will be three times Brett's current age. Brett's current age is 14, so three times that is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

This means that in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. To find out how old Angela is right now, we subtract 4 years from 42:

\[42 - 4 = 38\]

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

**Angela is 38 years old.**"
"Paul drives his car twice a day for 14 days. 

For the morning rides, he spends $6 each day, so for 14 days, he spends:
\[ 6 \times 14 = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

For the afternoon rides, he spends $2 each day, so for 14 days, he spends:
\[ 2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the costs of the morning and afternoon rides together, the total amount spent is:
\[ 84 + 28 = 112 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Paul spent a total of $112 on driving his car during these two weeks."
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, let's find the total number of oranges both brought together:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges, we can calculate the number of pies they can make by dividing the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, they can make 40 Greek orange pies."
"To find the number of guests at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests as \( x \).

For the first venue, the total cost is the flat fee plus the cost of food:
\[ \text{Cost}_1 = 200 + 5x \]

For the second venue, the total cost is the cost per person for the venue plus the cost of food, but since the food is already included, the cost is just the cost per person for the venue:
\[ \text{Cost}_2 = 25x \]

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( \boxed{10} \)."
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \(D\), by Lily as \(L\), and by Bodhi as \(B\).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \(L + D + B = 43\)
2. \(L = D + 7\)
3. \(D = \frac{1}{2}B\)

First, we can express \(B\) in terms of \(D\) using the third equation:
\[B = 2D\]

Now, we can substitute \(L\) and \(B\) in terms of \(D\) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]
\[ 4D = 36 \]
\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know \(D = 9\), we can find \(L\) and \(B\):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Lily found \(16\) insects.

Lily found 16 insects."
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the amount of yarn each of them used and then add those amounts together.

First, let's calculate the amount of yarn Mariah used:
Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, Mariah used:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the amount of yarn Mariah's grandma used:
Her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein of yarn. So, she used:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we add the amounts of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma:
\[ 91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, they used 273 yards of yarn altogether."
"To find out how many gifts Cherrie bought in total, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Gifts for the first 2 friends**: Each of these 2 friends wants 5 gifts.
   - Total gifts for these 2 friends = 2 friends * 5 gifts/friend = 10 gifts

2. **Gifts for the next 3 friends**: Each of these 3 friends wants 2 gifts.
   - Total gifts for these 3 friends = 3 friends * 2 gifts/friend = 6 gifts

3. **Additional random gifts**: Cherrie decides to buy 10 more random gifts.
   - Additional gifts = 10 gifts

Now, we add all these together to find the total number of gifts:

- Total gifts = Gifts for the first 2 friends + Gifts for the next 3 friends + Additional random gifts
- Total gifts = 10 + 6 + 10 = 26

Therefore, Cherrie bought a total of 26 gifts."
"First, let's determine the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, and the chair is 3 feet wide, the rug is:

\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet wide} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Since the rug is 8 feet wide, twice the width of the rug is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Adding 2 feet to this value gives us the length of the couch:

\[ 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the couch is 18 feet long."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. Two of these packs are strawberry.
3. One pack is grape, which costs $2.
4. One pack is green apple, which costs half as much as the grape pack, so it costs $1.
5. The total cost of all the packs is $7.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

The total cost can be represented as:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

Each pack of strawberry gum costs $2."
"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, he should buy the cheapest lumber, which is the 2 x 4 piece of wood. Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks, and each costs $4. With $24 to spend, Frederick can buy:

\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

pieces of 2 x 4 wood. Therefore, the total number of popsicle sticks he can make is:

"First, we need to determine the total number of legs among Mario's 6 sled dogs. Since each dog has 4 legs, we can calculate the total number of legs as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of snowshoes are required. Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we can calculate the number of pairs needed as follows:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of pairs by the cost per pair:

\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times \$12.00 \text{ per pair} = \$144.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:

\[ \$144.00 \]"
"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass and then subtract the cost of the pass.

First, let's calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass:
- Each bus trip costs $2.20.
- She takes two bus trips a day.
- She does this five days a week.

So, the cost per day is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times \$2.20 \text{ per trip} = \$4.40 \text{ per day} \]

Then, the cost for five days is:
\[ \$4.40 \text{ per day} \times 5 \text{ days} = \$22.00 \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the weekly bus pass from the total cost of her bus trips:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Janet would save:
\[ \$2.00 \]"
"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. According to the problem:

1. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
2. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.

From point 1, if the farm has 30 cows, then the zoo should have half as many cows, which is not directly relevant to the number of sheep and cows we are given.

From point 2, if the zoo has 20 sheep, then the farm should have half as many sheep, which is 10 sheep.

Now, let's sum up the animals:

- The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 20 sheep + (the number of cows, which is not specified but not needed for the final count) = 20 sheep (assuming no cows are mentioned for the zoo, as the problem focuses on sheep and cows separately).

So, the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo combined is:

40 (from the farm) + 20 (from the zoo) = 60 animals.

60"
"Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought, we can determine the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought by dividing the quantities Rose bought by 4.

For onions:
\[ \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

For potatoes:
\[ \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes at the market."
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 pounds.
2. Determine the number of days Andy has to achieve this goal.
3. Calculate the daily calorie deficit required.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of calories to be burned.**

Andy wants to lose 30 pounds, and it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 pound. Therefore, the total number of calories to be burned is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Andy has to achieve this goal.**

Today is December 31st, and Andy's birthday is July 19th. The number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July (up to July 19th): 19 days

Adding these up:
\[ 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190 \text{ days} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the daily calorie deficit required.**

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total number of calories to be burned by the number of days:
\[ \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{190 \text{ days}} \approx 552.63 \text{ calories/day} \]

Therefore, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 553 calories to reach his goal."
"Gerald earns $30 every day. Since he worked for an entire week, he worked for 7 days. Therefore, his total earnings for the week are:

\[ 30 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ dollars} \]

Gerald spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

\[ 210 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 110 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Gerald has $110 left."
"First, we need to calculate the total distance Hannah will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she runs 8 laps, we can find the total distance by multiplying the number of laps by the distance per lap:

\[ 8 \text{ laps} \times 0.25 \text{ km/lap} = 2 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to determine how much water Hannah needs to drink for the total distance. Since she needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs, we can find the total amount of water by multiplying the total distance by the amount of water per kilometer:

\[ 2 \text{ km} \times 60 \text{ ml/km} = 120 \text{ ml} \]

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water."
"First, let's calculate how much Julie spent on clothes. She spent 20% of $500 on clothes:

\[ 20\% \times 500 = 0.20 \times 500 = 100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on clothes. Now, let's find out how much money she had left after buying clothes:

\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs:

\[ 25\% \times 400 = 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on CDs. Now, let's find out how much money she had left after buying CDs:

\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

Therefore, Julie had $300 left."
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house:
\[ H = 3L = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost is $90,000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags that Tara bought. She bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, at $4 per pack. So, the total number of canvas bags is:

\[ 8 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ bags/pack} = 40 \text{ bags} \]

The total cost for these bags is:

\[ 8 \text{ packs} \times \$4/\text{pack} = \$32 \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the bags. She sold each bag for $8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 40 \text{ bags} \times \$8/\text{bag} = \$320 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$320 - \$32 = \$288 \]

Therefore, the profit Tara earned on her bags is:

\[ \$288 \]"

1. Calculate the total time of the fight:
   - Each round lasts 3 minutes.
   - There are 5 rounds.
   - Total time = 3 minutes/round * 5 rounds = 15 minutes.

2. Calculate the total number of punches:
   - Joe throws 25 punches per minute.
   - Total time = 15 minutes.
   - Total punches = 25 punches/minute * 15 minutes = 375 punches.

Therefore, Joe threw 375 punches."
"To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. First, we know that Suzanne made 36 cookies.
2. Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made. So, we calculate the number of cookies Josh made as follows:
   \[
   \text{Cookies made by Josh} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9
   \]
3. Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we calculate the number of cookies Kelsie made as follows:
   \[
   \text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times 9 = 18
   \]

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially.

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. So, the total amount is calculated as follows:

\[ 4 \times 10 + 6 \times 20 = 40 + 120 = 160 \]

So, Ali has $160 in total.

Next, Ali gives half of this amount to his sister. Therefore, the amount given to his sister is:

\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \]

After giving $80 to his sister, the remaining amount is:

\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining $80 to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \]

After buying dinner, the amount of money Ali has left is:

\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is:

\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, let's convert Rob's time into minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, Rob takes \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes to shingle a house.

According to the problem, Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes. So, we first calculate double the time Rob takes, which is \(2 \times 120 = 240\) minutes. Then, we add 40 minutes to this value to find out how long Royce takes.

So, Royce takes \(240 + 40 = 280\) minutes.

Therefore, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house."
"To determine the total number of skeins of wool Martha needs, we first calculate the amount required for one grandchild and then multiply by three since she is making the same items for three grandchildren.

For one grandchild:
- Hat: 2 skeins
- Scarf: 4 skeins
- Sweater: 12 skeins
- Mittens: 1 skein
- Socks: 2 skeins

Total for one grandchild: \(2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 19\) skeins

Since she is making these for three grandchildren, we multiply the total by 3:
\(19 \times 3 = 57\) skeins

Therefore, Martha will need to buy 57 skeins of wool."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Chris starts with 100 math problems.
2. On Monday, he completes 12 problems. So, the remaining problems are:
   \[ 100 - 12 = 88 \]
3. On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday. So, he completes:
   \[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \]
   The remaining problems after Tuesday are:
   \[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]
4. On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining problems. So, he completes:
   \[ \frac{1}{4} \times 52 = 13 \]
   The remaining problems after Wednesday are:
   \[ 52 - 13 = 39 \]

Therefore, the number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is:
\[ \boxed{39} \]"
"First, let's determine the picking rate for each person:

- Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
- Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby picks \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
- Kathy picks twice as many as Bobby, so Kathy picks \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
- Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky picks \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, we add up the picking rates to find the total number of quarts picked per hour by all four:

\[6 \text{ (Tony)} + 5 \text{ (Bobby)} + 10 \text{ (Kathy)} + 8 \text{ (Ricky)} = 29\]

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is 29."

So, the bakers had 74 loaves of bread left."
"To determine the number of rows Jackson will plant, we need to calculate the number of rows for the red tulips and the blue tulips separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of rows for the red tulips:
- Jackson has 36 red tulips.
- He can fit 6 red tulips in a row.
- Therefore, the number of rows for the red tulips is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) rows.

Next, let's calculate the number of rows for the blue tulips:
- Jackson has 24 blue tulips.
- He can fit 8 blue tulips in a row.
- Therefore, the number of rows for the blue tulips is \( \frac{24}{8} = 3 \) rows.

Now, we add the number of rows for the red tulips and the blue tulips to find the total number of rows:
- Total number of rows = 6 (red) + 3 (blue) = 9 rows.

Therefore, Jackson will plant a total of 9 rows of flowers."

1. **Divide the total amount of raisins equally among the three uses (oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix):**
   \[
   \text{Raisins per use} = \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups per use}
   \]

2. **Calculate how many batches of oatmeal cookies can be made with 9 cups of raisins:**
   \[
   \text{Batches of oatmeal cookies} = \frac{9 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cup per batch}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \text{ batches}
   \]

Therefore, Heather can make \(\boxed{12}\) batches of oatmeal cookies."
"First, let's calculate Ada's current weekly electric consumption and cost.

Ada's current daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. There are 24 hours in a day, so her daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh) is:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} = 288 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

To find her weekly consumption, we multiply by 7 days:
\[ 288 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 2016 \, \text{kWh/week} \]

At a rate of $1.50 per kWh, her weekly bill is:
\[ 2016 \, \text{kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$3024 \, \text{per week} \]

Next, let's calculate her weekly consumption after adding the new device.

The new device consumes 2 kWh per hour. So, her total daily consumption will be:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/hour} + 2 \, \text{kWh/hour} = 14 \, \text{kWh/hour} \]

Her new daily consumption in kWh is:
\[ 14 \, \text{kWh/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} = 336 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

Her new weekly consumption is:
\[ 336 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 2352 \, \text{kWh/week} \]

At the same rate of $1.50 per kWh, her new weekly bill is:
\[ 2352 \, \text{kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$3528 \, \text{per week} \]

Finally, the difference between her weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device is:
\[ \$3528 - \$3024 = \$504 \]

So, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is:
\[ \$504 \]"
"First, let's determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house (since 10 days is double the time to paint half a house).

Now, if one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, we can calculate the rate of painting per person per day. The rate is \( \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} \).

If 5 people are working together, their combined rate would be \( 5 \times \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{5 \text{ houses}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{2 \text{ days}} \).

This means that 5 people can paint a whole house in 2 days. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total number of hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house is \( 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours} \).

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"Given that Ophelia has 20 sofas, and she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can calculate the number of chairs Ophelia has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = \text{Number of sofas Ophelia has} + 2 = 20 + 2 = 22 \]

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so:

\[ \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 3 \times \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = 3 \times 22 = 66 \]

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the number of sofas Jenna has is:

\[ \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} = \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:

\[ \text{Total number of sofas} = \text{Number of sofas Ophelia has} + \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} = 20 + 64 = 84 \]
\[ \text{Total number of chairs} = \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} + \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 22 + 66 = 88 \]

Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs they have is:

\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought without the headphone set, we first need to determine the cost of the headphone set.

Given:
- Cost of one CD = $4
- Total amount paid = $48

Let's calculate the cost of the headphone set:
\[ \text{Cost of headphone set} = \text{Total amount paid} - \text{Cost of one CD} \]
\[ \text{Cost of headphone set} = 48 - 4 = 44 \]

Now, if Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have had the full $48 to spend on CDs. To find out how many CDs he could buy with $48, we divide the total amount by the cost of one CD:
\[ \text{Number of CDs} = \frac{\text{Total amount}}{\text{Cost of one CD}} \]
\[ \text{Number of CDs} = \frac{48}{4} = 12 \]

Since Tom originally bought one CD, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is:
\[ 12 - 1 = 11 \]

Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set."
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. For 6 weeks, Josh worked out for 4 hours each week.
2. For 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week.
3. For 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total hours:

- For the 6 weeks at 4 hours each: \(6 \times 4 = 24\) hours
- For the 2 weeks at 5 hours each: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours
- For the 1 week at 6 hours: \(1 \times 6 = 6\) hours

Adding these together gives us the total number of hours:

\(24 + 10 + 6 = 40\) hours

So, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40 hours."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers becomes:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, 5 times that number is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
   So, 40 passengers get on the bus, making the total number of passengers:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
4. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers becomes:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
5. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, 3 times fewer means:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
   So, 7 passengers get on the bus, making the total number of passengers:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

Therefore, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is:
\[
66
\]"
"First, let's determine Jame's current age. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, then he is currently \(27 - 5 = 22\) years old.

Next, we need to find out how old Jame will be in 8 years. In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\) years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, we calculate twice Jame's age in 8 years and then subtract 5:

\[2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55\]

This means that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 55 years old. To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55:

\[55 - 8 = 47\]

Now, we need to find the current age difference between Jame and his cousin. Jame is currently 22 years old, and his cousin is currently 47 years old. The age difference is:

\[47 - 22 = 25\]

So, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Given that the computer cost $1,100 and Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can determine the cost of the printer as follows:

Cost of the printer = Cost of the computer - $400
Cost of the printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of the printer = $700

Now, let's denote the cost of one monitor as \( M \). Since Errol bought 2 monitors, the total cost for the monitors is \( 2M \).

The total cost for the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We can set up the following equation:

Cost of the computer + Cost of the 2 monitors + Cost of the printer = Total cost
$1,100 + 2M + $700 = $2,400

Now, we can solve for \( M \):

$1,100 + 2M + $700 = $2,400
$1,800 + 2M = $2,400
2M = $2,400 - $1,800
2M = $600
M = $600 / 2
M = $300

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300."
"The boys brought back 60 seashells each. According to the problem, the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. 

So, the number of seashells each girl brought is:

**Final Answer: Anne is 8 years old.**"
"The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 mm = 62 mm thick.

To find the total thickness of the four books, we add their individual thicknesses together:

31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma should make to complete her monthly goal, we first need to calculate how many vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

Adding these together: \(18 + 21 + 15 = 54\) vlogs.

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs per month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:

\(72 - 54 = 18\)

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month.

"To determine how much you ended up paying, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total bill including the tip:**
   - The base bill is $50.
   - The tip is 20% of $50.
   - 20% of $50 is \( 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \).

2. **Add the tip to the base bill:**
   - Total bill = Base bill + Tip
   - Total bill = $50 + $10 = $60.

3. **Split the total bill evenly:**
   - Since the bill is to be split evenly between you and your wife, each person pays half of the total bill.
   - Each person's share = Total bill / 2
   - Each person's share = $60 / 2 = $30.

4. **Determine your payment:**
   - Since you are paying an additional 20% tip on the base bill, you are paying your share of the total bill, which is $30.

Therefore, you end up paying $30."
"First, let's determine how much each boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, each boy initially gets:

\[ \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The eldest boy then added $5 to his share, making it:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

The following day, he added another $10, making his total:

\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

He then spent $8, so his new total is:

\[ 21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

After spending $8, he tripled the amount he had left, so he now has:

\[ 13 \times 3 = 39 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 39 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to break down the month of April into two halves and determine the daily savings for each half.

April has 30 days, so the first half consists of the first 15 days and the second half consists of the last 15 days.

Let's denote the daily savings in the first half as \( x \). Therefore, the total savings for the first half of April would be \( 15x \).

According to the problem, Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half. So, the daily savings in the second half would be \( 2x \). The total savings for the second half of April would be \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. Therefore, the sum of the savings from both halves of the month should equal $1125:

\[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 45:

\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of April. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he needs to save:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of each type of fruit Verna bought:

- Apples: 3 apples * $1.50 each = $4.50
- Oranges: 5 oranges * $0.80 each = $4.00
- Peaches: 6 peaches * $0.75 each = $4.50

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the fruits:

Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave:

Change = Amount given - Total cost
Change = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

Therefore, Verna received $7.00 in change."
"To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Jairus earns.

3. Subtract Jenny's total from Jairus's total to find the difference.

Step 1: Jairus's earnings
- Jairus earns $0.8 per task.
- He completed 20 tasks.
- Therefore, Jairus's total earnings = $0.8 * 20 = $16.

Step 2: Jenny's earnings
- Jenny earns $0.5 per task.
- She also completed 20 tasks.
- Therefore, Jenny's total earnings = $0.5 * 20 = $10.

Step 3: Calculate the difference
- Difference = Jairus's total earnings - Jenny's total earnings
- Difference = $16 - $10 = $6.

Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny."
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."
"Jeff walks to work and back home each day, which is a total of 3 miles + 3 miles = 6 miles per day. If he works 5 times a week, then the total miles he walks in a week is 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Writing the alphabet in full twice:**
   - The alphabet has 26 letters.
   - Writing it in full twice means \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. **Writing half of the alphabet once:**
   - Half of the alphabet is \(26 / 2 = 13\) letters.
   - Writing half of the alphabet once means \(13\) letters.

3. **Re-writing everything she has already written:**
   - So far, Elise has written \(52 + 13 = 65\) letters.
   - Re-writing everything means writing these 65 letters again.

4. **Total number of letters written:**
   - The total is the sum of the letters written in the first two steps and the re-written letters.
   - Therefore, the total is \(52 + 13 + 65 = 130\).

Final numerical answer:
130"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth, as each round of calls multiplies the number of families notified by a factor of 3.

1. In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.
2. In the second round, those 3 families each call 3 more families, so \(3 \times 3 = 9\) new families are notified.
3. In the third round, the 9 families each call 3 more families, so \(9 \times 3 = 27\) new families are notified.
4. In the fourth round, the 27 families each call 3 more families, so \(27 \times 3 = 81\) new families are notified.

Therefore, during the fourth round of calls, 81 families will be notified.

2. Add the total weight lost to the final weight to find the initial weight: \(70 \, \text{pounds} + 30 \, \text{pounds} = 100 \, \text{pounds}\).

Therefore, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of toys in James's play set:**
   - James's play set has 80 toys.

2. **Calculate the number of toys needed for Jonathan's play set:**
   - Jonathan's play set needs to be five times larger than James's play set.
   - Therefore, Jonathan's play set needs \(5 \times 80 = 400\) toys.

3. **Determine how many more toys Jonathan needs:**
   - Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to reach 400 toys.
   - Let \(x\) be the number of toys Jonathan currently has.
   - According to the problem, \(x + 2 = 400\).

4. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - \(x + 2 = 400\)
   - \(x = 400 - 2\)
   - \(x = 398\)

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

**Final numerical answer:**

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Five notebooks at $1.50 each: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)
- Two pens at $0.25 each: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
- One calculator at $12 each: \(1 \times 12 = 12.00\)
- One geometry set at $10 each: \(1 \times 10 = 10.00\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00\]

Now, applying a 10% discount to the total cost:
\[30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00\]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost:
\[30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00\]

Therefore, Daniel has to spend $27.00 on all the items he wants to buy."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Carly ordered:

- Ten packs of potato fries at $0.30 each: \(10 \times 0.30 = 3\) dollars
- Five cans of fruit drinks at $2 each: \(5 \times 2 = 10\) dollars

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost:

\[20 + 3 + 10 = 33\] dollars

Carly gives a fifty-dollar bill, so the change she should receive is:

\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars

Therefore, the change Carly gets back is 17 dollars."
"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned, we need to break down her sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the amount over $1000.

1. For the first $1000, she earns a 30% commission:
\[ \text{Commission for first } \$1000 = 1000 \times 0.30 = \$300 \]

2. For the sales over $1000, which in this case is $2500 - $1000 = $1500, she earns an additional 10% commission:
\[ \text{Commission for sales over } \$1000 = 1500 \times 0.10 = \$150 \]

3. Adding both commissions together gives the total amount earned:
\[ \text{Total commission} = \$300 + \$150 = \$450 \]

Therefore, Antonella earned \(\$450\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of water bottles Bill already has:

He has 2 cases of water, with each case containing 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he has is:
\[ 2 \times 24 = 48 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles he needs in total for his 70 guests, with each guest getting 2 bottles:
\[ 70 \times 2 = 140 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, to find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles needed:
\[ 140 - 48 = 92 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Bill will need to buy an additional 92 bottles of water."
"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does in cold water. 

In cold water, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. Therefore, twice this time is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes. Adding 2 minutes to this gives us the time it takes in warm water: \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes per mile.

Now, we need to calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both conditions.

- In cold water, the time to swim 3 miles is \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes.
- In warm water, the time to swim 3 miles is \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes.

To find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day, we subtract the time in cold water from the time in warm water:

\[102 - 48 = 54\]

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."
"To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings first.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day. So, his daily earnings are:
\[ 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \]

He works 4 days a week, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."

"To find the total number of holes in all the buttons, we need to calculate the holes from the buttons with two holes and the buttons with four holes separately, and then add them together.

First, we know that there are 7 buttons with 2 holes each. So, the total number of holes from these buttons is:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

Next, we need to find out how many buttons have 4 holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have 2 holes, the remaining buttons are:
\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \]
These 14 buttons each have 4 holes, so the total number of holes from these buttons is:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

Now, we add the holes from both groups of buttons:
\[ 14 + 56 = 70 \]

Therefore, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is:

"First, let's determine the weight of each person:

1. Mark weighs 150 pounds.
2. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan's weight is \(150 - 20 = 130\) pounds.
3. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob's weight is \(130 \times 2 = 260\) pounds.

Now, to find the average weight of the three friends, we add their weights together and divide by 3:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the initial angle of the pyramid and the movement of the sun over time.

1. The initial angle of the pyramid from the ground is 32 degrees.
2. The sun moves 5 degrees per hour straight upward.
3. The sun moves for 10 hours.

The total movement of the sun in 10 hours is:
\[ 5 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 50 \, \text{degrees} \]

Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground, and it moves 50 degrees straight upward, the new angle from the ground to the sun will be:
\[ 32 \, \text{degrees} + 50 \, \text{degrees} = 82 \, \text{degrees} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{82} \]"
"First, let's determine the ages of James's sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, which means the other son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of candles required. Since each son needs a candle for each year of their age, we add the ages of both sons: 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Now, we need to find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Each pack contains 5 candles, so we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: 20 / 5 = 4 packs.

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pack costs $3, so we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 4 * $3 = $12.

James spends $12 on candles."
"First, let's calculate how many minutes Judy read each night in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night and there are 7 nights in a week, the total reading time in the first week is:

\[ 15 \, \text{minutes/night} \times 7 \, \text{nights} = 105 \, \text{minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pages she read in the first week. Given that she reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she reads per minute by dividing 2 pages by 1.5 minutes:

\[ \frac{2 \, \text{pages}}{1.5 \, \text{minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \, \text{pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages she read in the first week by multiplying the number of minutes she read by the number of pages per minute:

\[ 105 \, \text{minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \, \text{pages/minute} = 140 \, \text{pages} \]

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages she read in two weeks is the sum of the pages read in the first week and the second week:

\[ 140 \, \text{pages} + 100 \, \text{pages} = 240 \, \text{pages} \]

So, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

Given:
- Shiloh's current age, \( S = 44 \) years.
- In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \).
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, \( S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \).

Substituting \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

10"
"Let's break down the payments step by step:

1. For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 per tooth. So, for three teeth, that's $1.00 × 3 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. So, for two teeth, that's $0.50 × 2 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all the amounts:

- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

Total amount = $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00

The tooth fairy left Sharon a total of $9.00."
"Given that Richie scored 80 goals, and he scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can determine the number of goals Mark scored as follows:

\[ \text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Similarly, since Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, we can determine the number of goals Anna scored as follows:

\[ \text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:

\[ \text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} \]
\[ \text{Total goals} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

Therefore, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is 175."
"To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made compared to Liam, we first need to calculate how much money each of them made.

Liam made $63.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each, so we calculate his earnings as follows:
\[ 21 \text{ lemonades} \times \$4 \text{ per lemonade} = \$84 \]

Now, to find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:
\[ \$84 - \$63 = \$21 \]

Therefore, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam that weekend."
"First, let's calculate how much Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday.

Peter spends an equal amount each day, and there are 4 days from Sunday through Wednesday. Let's denote the amount spent each day as \( x \). Therefore, the total amount spent on wooden action figures is \( 4x \).

Since Peter has $70 and he spends an equal amount each day for 7 days, the amount spent each day is:
\[ x = \frac{70}{7} = 10 \]

So, the total amount spent on wooden action figures is:
\[ 4x = 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

This means Peter has \( 70 - 40 = 30 \) dollars left to spend on plastic action figures.

The cost of each plastic action figure is $2. Therefore, the number of plastic action figures he can buy is:
\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

From Sunday through Wednesday, he bought:
\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is:
\[ 8 + 15 = 23 \]

Final numerical answer:

3. Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.
4. Compare the total number of roses Ford grows in a month with the total number of roses he needs to supply to the flower shops in a month to find the deficit.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per week.
- First flower shop: 20 roses
- Second flower shop: 15 roses
- Third flower shop: 30 roses
Total per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Step 2: Determine the number of weeks in a month.
- We assume an average month has 4 weeks.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.
- Ford grows 40 roses every week.
- In a month (4 weeks), Ford grows: 40 * 4 = 160 roses

Step 4: Calculate the total number of roses Ford needs to supply to the flower shops in a month.
- Ford needs to supply: 65 roses/week * 4 weeks = 260 roses

Step 5: Determine the deficit.
- Ford grows 160 roses in a month.

"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total revenue and the total cost, then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.
   - Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Cost of bread: Each loaf costs $3.00 and makes 10 sandwiches, so the cost per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30.
   - Cost of bread for 10 sandwiches = 10 sandwiches * $0.30/sandwich = $3.00
   - Cost of cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches = $30.00
   - Total cost = Cost of bread + Cost of cheeses and condiments = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct setting for a 520-degree recipe.

First, let's calculate the percentage error in the temperature setting:

\[ \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Temperature} - \text{Set Temperature}}{\text{Set Temperature}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 0.04 \times 100 = 4\% \]

So, the oven is 4% too hot.

Now, we need to find the correct setting for a 520-degree recipe. If the oven is 4% too hot, we need to set it to a temperature that, when 4% is added, equals 520 degrees. Let's denote the correct setting as \( x \).

\[ x + 0.04x = 520 \]
\[ 1.04x = 520 \]
\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]
\[ x = 500 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees if her recipe calls for 520 degrees."
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, the first movie is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours into minutes gives:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]
Adding the 5 minutes gives:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 125 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the durations of the two movies together:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 125 \text{ minutes} = 215 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate how much 30% of Herb's house price is, and then subtract that from Herb's house price.

1. Calculate 30% of $76,000:
\[ 30\% \times 76,000 = 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

2. Subtract that amount from Herb's house price to find the value of Juan's house:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

3. Now, add the value of both houses together:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy brought. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend:

- Judy's total: \(12 \text{ cups} + 24 \text{ dishes} = 36 \text{ utensils}\)
- Her friend's total: \(40 \text{ cups} + 44 \text{ dishes} = 84 \text{ utensils}\)

Adding these together gives the total number of utensils brought by the two:

\[36 + 84 = 120\]

The total number of utensils brought by the two is 120."
"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount. 

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

Since the question asks for the cost per pair of contacts, and assuming a pair is two contacts, the cost per pair is:
\[ 1.00 \times 2 = 2.00 \]

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \boxed{2.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours worked by Jill and John.

Jill worked:
- 2 hours on Saturday
- 1 hour on Sunday
Total hours for Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

John worked:
- Twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday
- Three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday
Total hours for John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours

Now, let's calculate the earnings for each.

Jill's earnings:
- $10 per hour * 3 hours = $30

John's earnings:
- $10 per hour * 7 hours = $70

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:
- John's earnings - Jill's earnings = $70 - $30 = $40

John earned $40 more than Jill.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
$40"
"First, let's calculate the total calories Hannah burns from aerobics and running.

- Aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
- Running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Now, according to the given ratio, Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. To find out how much water she needs for 1600 calories, we can set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{100 \, \text{ml}}{200 \, \text{calories}} = \frac{x \, \text{ml}}{1600 \, \text{calories}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{100 \, \text{ml} \times 1600 \, \text{calories}}{200 \, \text{calories}} \]

\[ x = \frac{160000 \, \text{ml} \cdot \text{calories}}{200 \, \text{calories}} \]

\[ x = 800 \, \text{ml} \]

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the note on the jar, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans.

So, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) can be expressed as:
\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]

And the number of green jelly beans \( G \) can be expressed as:
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500, so we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]
\[ 3B = 4500 \]
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."
"To find the average of Jared's three typing speed measurements, we first need to determine the third measurement. 

1. Initial typing speed: 47 WPM
2. After lessons: 52 WPM
3. After further increase: 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Now, we calculate the average of these three measurements:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3}
\]

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{156}{3} = 52
\]

The average of the three measurements is 52 WPM."
"To find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and donuts for breakfast, we need to calculate the weight change for each option over the 5-week period and then find the difference between these changes.

1. **Cheerios:**
   - Weight loss per week: 1.25 pounds
   - Over 5 weeks: \(1.25 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 6.25 \, \text{pounds}\)

2. **Donuts:**
   - Weight gain per week: 1.75 pounds
   - Over 5 weeks: \(1.75 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 8.75 \, \text{pounds}\)

3. **Difference in weight change:**
   - Weight change with donuts: +8.75 pounds
   - Weight change with Cheerios: -6.25 pounds
   - Difference: \(8.75 \, \text{pounds} - (-6.25 \, \text{pounds}) = 8.75 \, \text{pounds} + 6.25 \, \text{pounds} = 15 \, \text{pounds}\)

The difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating donuts and Cheerios for breakfast is 15 pounds."
"To determine the total number of seats Alex will need, we need to account for all the people who will be attending the event.

1. Alex initially invites 100 people via email.
2. Each of these 100 people will also invite 2 friends. So, the number of additional people invited by email invites is \(100 \times 2 = 200\).
3. Alex also calls 10 of her friends and invites them. So, there are 10 more people invited this way.
4. Out of these 10 friends, 8 will bring their spouses. So, there are 8 additional people (spouses) coming.

Now, let's sum up all the attendees:
- Initial email invites: 100
- Additional people from email invites: 200
- Friends invited by phone: 10
- Spouses: 8

Total number of seats needed = \(100 + 200 + 10 + 8 = 318\).

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats."
"The Affenpinscher weighed 10 pounds.

The Dachshund weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so:
\[ \text{Dachshund's weight} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ pounds} \]

The Papillon weighed one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so:
\[ \text{Papillon's weight} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

The Mastiff weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so:
\[ \text{Mastiff's weight} = 44 \times 5 = 220 \text{ pounds} \]

The Mastiff weighed 220 pounds."
"To determine how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we need to calculate the total cost for each platform and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the boots on Amazon:
- Cost of boots: $16
- Shipping cost: $4
- Total cost on Amazon: $16 + $4 = $20

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the boots on eBay:
- Cost of boots: $13
- Shipping cost: Twice the cost of Amazon's shipping, so $4 * 2 = $8
- Total cost on eBay: $13 + $8 = $21

Now, we find the difference in total cost between eBay and Amazon:
- Total cost on eBay: $21
- Total cost on Amazon: $20
- Difference: $21 - $20 = $1

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to grow taller than 20 feet, given that it doubles its height every day and starts at 4 feet tall.

Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk day by day:

- Day 0: 4 feet
- Day 1: 4 feet * 2 = 8 feet
- Day 2: 8 feet * 2 = 16 feet
- Day 3: 16 feet * 2 = 32 feet

On Day 3, the beanstalk reaches 32 feet, which is taller than the 20 feet required to be taller than Mark's window.

Therefore, it takes 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the protein content per gram of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the daily protein intake.
3. Calculate the weekly protein intake.

Step 1: The protein content per gram of mushrooms is \( \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms} \).

Step 2: John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. Therefore, his daily protein intake is \( 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} \times 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms} = 6 \text{ grams of protein per day} \).

Step 3: To find the weekly protein intake, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 (the number of days in a week). So, \( 6 \text{ grams of protein per day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ grams of protein per week} \).

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms."
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

1. The base price for 2 implants is $2000 each, so for 2 implants, it's:
   \[2 \times 2000 = 4000\]

2. For one of the implants, there's an extra cost for a porcelain crown, which is $500. So, the total cost for the dental work is:
   \[4000 + 500 = 4500\]

3. George has already put down a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
   \[4500 - 600 = 3900\]

4. George makes $15 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
   \[3900 \div 15 = 260\]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:

\[ x = 30 \]

Now, we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Colby has in nickels, dimes, quarters, and pennies.

- Quarters: 8 quarters × $0.25 = $2.00
- Dimes: 6 dimes × $0.10 = $0.60
- Nickels: 14 nickels × $0.05 = $0.70
- Pennies: 15 pennies × $0.01 = $0.15

Now, let's add these amounts together to find the total amount of money Colby has:

$2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45

Since each gumball costs a nickel ($0.05), we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy:

$3.45 ÷ $0.05 = 69

Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"To determine the total number of legs the pets in the store have, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

- Dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- Cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- Birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:

\(20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}\)

Therefore, the total number of legs the pets in the store have is 48."
"Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He increases the weight by 50%, so the new weight is:

\[ 8 \text{ pounds} + (0.50 \times 8 \text{ pounds}) = 8 \text{ pounds} + 4 \text{ pounds} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, he uses a weight that is two pounds lighter than this, so the final weight he uses is:

\[ 12 \text{ pounds} - 2 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

The weight that he now uses is 10 pounds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Games**: Steve gets 5 games for his birthday.
2. **First Year**: He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so he gets \(1 \times 12 = 12\) games.
3. **Second Year**: He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so he gets \(2 \times 12 = 24\) games.
4. **Third Year**: He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, so he gets \(4 \times 12 = 48\) games.
5. **Christmas Gifts**: He gets 5 games every year for 3 years, so he gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) games.

Now, let's add all these together:

\[5 \text{ (initial)} + 12 \text{ (first year)} + 24 \text{ (second year)} + 48 \text{ (third year)} + 15 \text{ (Christmas)} = 104\]

So, after 3 years, Steve has **104 games**."
"First, we need to determine the speed of the plane. The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so the speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. Using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

we substitute the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate.

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolate Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds of chocolate Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds as Ruiz in an hour:

\[ 60 \times \frac{3}{4} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we find out how many pounds of chocolate Ruiz and Marissa can make together in one hour:

\[ 60 + 45 = 105 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Since they worked for 12 hours in a day, we multiply the total amount they can make in one hour by 12:

\[ 105 \times 12 = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together in 12 hours is:

\[ 1260 \text{ pounds} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Monday's Spending:**
   - Howard spends $8 at the arcade.

2. **Tuesday's Spending:**
   - He spends twice as much as he did on Monday.
   - Therefore, he spends \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars on Tuesday.

3. **Wednesday's Spending:**
   - He spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday.
   - Therefore, he spends \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars on Wednesday.

4. **Total Spending:**
   - Adding up all his spending: \(8 + 16 + 64 = 88\) dollars.

5. **Initial Amount:**
   - Howard originally had $100.

6. **Money Left:**
   - Subtracting his total spending from his initial amount: \(100 - 88 = 12\) dollars.

Therefore, Howard has $12 left."
"To calculate the total money Patrick earned, we need to break down the earnings into two parts: the earnings from the first four hours and the earnings from the next two hours.

For the first four hours:
- He sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Therefore, his earnings per hour were \(15 \times 0.50 = 7.50\) dollars.
- Over four hours, his total earnings were \(7.50 \times 4 = 30\) dollars.

For the next two hours:
- He sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Therefore, his earnings per hour were \(10 \times 0.60 = 6.00\) dollars.
- Over two hours, his total earnings were \(6.00 \times 2 = 12\) dollars.

Adding the earnings from both periods:
- Total earnings = \(30 + 12 = 42\) dollars.

Patrick earned a total of 42 dollars from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations per tire for Jeremy's monthly driving.
2. Determine the total number of rotations per tire over a year.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations per tire for Jeremy's monthly driving.**

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
\[ \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/rotation cycle}} \times 725 \text{ rotations/cycle} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of rotations per tire over a year.**

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of rotations per tire in a year is:
\[ 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.**

To find out how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations, we divide the total number of rotations by the number of rotations per year:
\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the tire will need to be replaced in \(\boxed{6}\) years."
"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of washings per pump.
2. Determine the cost per washing.
3. Calculate the cost per pump.

First, we know that 2 pumps of shampoo give 120 washings. Therefore, 1 pump would give half of that number of washings:
\[ \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per washing. The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, and it provides 120 washings:
\[ \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{24.00}{120} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \]

Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost per pump is:
\[ \text{Cost per pump} = 60 \times 0.20 = 12.00 \text{ dollars} \]

To convert this cost into cents, we multiply by 100 (since 1 dollar = 100 cents):
\[ \text{Cost per pump in cents} = 12.00 \times 100 = 1200 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost per pump is:
\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"First, let's calculate the discount on the items Joe wants to buy.

The shirt originally costs $25, and there is a 30% discount on it. The discount amount for the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

So, the discounted price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

Next, the shorts cost $35, and there is no discount mentioned for the shorts. So, the price of the shorts remains $35.

Now, let's add the discounted price of the shirt and the price of the shorts to find the total cost of the items:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. Since the total cost of the items is $52.50, which is more than what Joe has, he cannot afford to buy both items. However, if we assume the question is asking hypothetically or there's a typo and he can only buy one item, we'll calculate the remaining money for the shirt.

The cost of the shirt after discount is $17.50. So, the remaining money Joe will have after buying the shirt is:
\[ 50 - 17.50 = 32.50 \]

Therefore, if Joe buys the shirt, he will have:
\[ \boxed{32.50} \]

If Joe buys the shorts, he will not have enough money, as the total cost exceeds his budget."
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the amount of butter needed for the total number of dozens of croissants.

First, Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days. So, the total number of dozens of croissants he will make in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we know that it takes \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, for 28 dozen croissants, the amount of butter needed is:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make these croissants."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we first need to calculate the cost of repaving each street.

1. Calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:
   - Cost per meter = $194
   - Length of Monica's street = 150 meters
   - Cost for Monica's street = $194 * 150 = $29,100

2. Calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:
   - Cost per meter = $194
   - Length of Lewis' street = 490 meters
   - Cost for Lewis' street = $194 * 490 = $95,060

3. Find the difference in cost between Lewis' street and Monica's street:
   - Difference in cost = Cost for Lewis' street - Cost for Monica's street
   - Difference in cost = $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

The final numerical answer is:
$65,960"
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the costs into two parts: the initial 5 months and the subsequent months.

1. **Initial 5 months:**
   - John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.
   - Total cost for the first 5 months: $100,000.

2. **Subsequent months:**
   - The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, which is 50 months in total.
   - Therefore, the research takes 50 - 5 = 45 months after the initial 5 months.
   - Each of these 45 months costs 50% more than the previous month.
   - The cost for the 6th month is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000.
   - The cost for the 7th month is $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000.
   - This pattern continues, with each month's cost being 1.5 times the previous month's cost.

The cost for each month forms a geometric series where the first term \(a = 150,000\) and the common ratio \(r = 1.5\). The sum of the first 45 terms of this series can be calculated using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:

\[ S_n = a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1} \]

Here, \(a = 150,000\), \(r = 1.5\), and \(n = 45\).

\[ S_{45} = 150,000 \frac{1.5^{45} - 1}{1.5 - 1} \]
\[ S_{45} = 150,000 \frac{1.5^{45} - 1}{0.5} \]
\[ S_{45} = 300,000 (1.5^{45} - 1) \]

Now, we need to calculate \(1.5^{45}\):

\[ 1.5^{45} \approx 1,188,137.74 \]

So,

\[ S_{45} = 300,000 (1,188,137.74 - 1) \]
\[ S_{45} = 300,000 \times 1,188,136.74 \]
\[ S_{45} \approx 356,440,022,000 \]

Adding the initial 5 months' cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 100,000 + 356,440,022,000 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} \approx 356,440,122,000 \]

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is approximately $356,440,122,000."
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to add up the ounces of meat each player ate.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that's 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, this is 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these together:

6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days in March.
2. Calculate the total number of posts per day for the entire group.
3. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in March.

March typically has 31 days.

Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day. With 1000 members, the total number of posts per day for the group is:
\[ 1000 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ posts/member/day} = 3000 \text{ posts/day} \]

Now, to find the total number of posts in March:
\[ 3000 \text{ posts/day} \times 31 \text{ days} = 93000 \text{ posts} \]

Therefore, the total number of posts that the group will have in March is:

"To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of meat from the bull.
2. Determine how much meat Prince sells in one day.
3. Calculate the number of days required to sell all the meat.

First, the total amount of meat from the bull is 750kg.

Next, Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day. Therefore, the amount of meat he sells in one day is:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Now, to find out how many days it will take Prince to sell 750kg of meat, we divide the total amount of meat by the amount he sells per day:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"First, let's calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, so the total number of seats is:

\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \]

Next, we calculate the number of seats occupied by the administrators, which is one-fourth of the total seats:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \]

Subtracting the seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats gives us the number of remaining seats:

\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \]

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents, so the number of seats occupied by the parents is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

The rest of the seats were occupied by the students. To find the number of seats occupied by the students, we subtract the seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats:

\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is:

"To determine the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to calculate the remaining play times for each DVD and then sum them up.

For the first DVD:
- It can be played 1000 times before it breaks.
- It has already been played 356 times.
- Remaining play times = 1000 - 356 = 644 times.

For the second DVD:
- It can be played 1000 times before it breaks.
- It has already been played 135 times.
- Remaining play times = 1000 - 135 = 865 times.

Now, we add the remaining play times of both DVDs:
- Total remaining play times = 644 + 865 = 1509 times.

Therefore, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 1509."
"To calculate the total cost of John's physical therapy, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of hours John spent in physical therapy.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the hourly rate.

First, let's find the total number of hours John spent in physical therapy:

- John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks.
- Each week, he went twice, so he had 2 sessions per week.
- Each session lasted 2 hours.

So, the total number of hours per week is:
\[ 2 \text{ sessions/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/session} = 4 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, we multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Pack of Gum**: Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.

2. **Gum Chewing at School**: He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, after school, he has:
   \[
   20 - 4 = 16 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Gum Chewing on the Way Home and After Dinner**: He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so he chews:
   \[
   1 + 1 = 2 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   After these, he has:
   \[
   16 - 2 = 14 \text{ pieces}
   \]

4. **Giving Half to His Sister**: He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives:
   \[
   \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   After giving gum to his sister, he has:
   \[
   14 - 7 = 7 \text{ pieces}
   \]

So, at the end of the day, Jim has \(\boxed{7}\) pieces of gum left."

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb/s to Mb/s.
2. Convert the speed from Mb/s to Mb/h.

Step 1: Convert kb/s to Mb/s
Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we divide the speed in kb/s by 1000 to get the speed in Mb/s.
\[ \text{Speed in Mb/s} = \frac{20 \text{ kb/s}}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \]

Step 2: Convert Mb/s to Mb/h
There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply the speed in Mb/s by 3600 to get the speed in Mb/h.
\[ \text{Speed in Mb/h} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s/h} = 72 \text{ Mb/h} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"To calculate the total number of cars towed in that week, we can break down the problem as follows:

- For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. So, for three days, the total is \(10 \times 3 = 30\) cars.
- For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars than the first three days, which means it pulled \(10 - 4 = 6\) cars each day. So, for four days, the total is \(6 \times 4 = 24\) cars.

Adding these together, the total number of cars towed in the week is \(30 + 24 = 54\).

Therefore, the total number of cars towed that week is 54."
"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow to the required height.

First, convert Adam's current height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot:

\[ \text{Adam's current height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The required height to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Now, calculate the height difference:

\[ \text{Height difference} = 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:

\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, calculate the number of years it will take for Adam to grow the required height:

\[ \text{Number of years} = \frac{\frac{2}{3} \text{ feet}}{\frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year}} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.
2. Calculate the total cost to acquire the cars.
3. Determine the profit.
4. Calculate James's commission on the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.**

James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost to acquire the cars.**

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
\[ \text{Cost per car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000 \]

**Step 3: Determine the profit.**

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

**Step 4: Calculate James's commission on the profit.**

James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
\[ \text{Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

**Final Answer:**

"First, we need to determine how many of the 100 riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate:

\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \]

So, 25 riders can stay upright.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are men. We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, which means 40% are men. Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is:

\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can calculate the price of a gold jewel as follows:

The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel. Therefore, the price of a gold jewel is:
\[
\frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600
\]

Next, we calculate the price of a silver jewel, which is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel:
\[
1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, we find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:
\[
2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

The total price for all three jewels is:

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob. 

Bob is driving at 55 mph, and Tom is driving at 70 mph. The difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, we can find the time it takes for Tom to catch up by dividing the distance by the relative speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to follow the information given step by step.

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we first need to calculate the maximum total cost that would still allow the cost per class to be $10 or less.

Given:
- Total cost for 10 classes = $60
- Cost per class if 10 classes are attended = $60 / 10 = $6
- Maximum cost per class allowed = $10

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as \( x \). If he misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class in this scenario would be \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \).

We need to find the maximum \( x \) such that the cost per class does not exceed $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes and still have the cost per class be $10 or less. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{4}

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles."
"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

1. **Cost of one apple:**
   - Four apples cost $5.20.
   - Therefore, the cost of one apple is \( \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of one orange:**
   - Three oranges cost $3.30.
   - Therefore, the cost of one orange is \( \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost for 5 apples:**
   - Since one apple costs $1.30, 5 apples will cost \( 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \) dollars.

4. **Total cost for 5 oranges:**
   - Since one orange costs $1.10, 5 oranges will cost \( 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \) dollars.

5. **Total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:**
   - Adding the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we get \( 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \) dollars.

Therefore, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) it will take him to dig the hole is:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise:

\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$20000 + (0.05 \times \$20000) = \$20000 + \$1000 = \$21000 \]

Next, we add the bonus, which is half a month's salary:

\[ \text{Bonus} = \frac{1}{2} \times \$21000 = \$10500 \]

So, Tim's total monthly income after the raise and bonus is:

\[ \text{Total Monthly Income} = \$21000 + \$10500 = \$31500 \]

To find out how much money Tim will make in a year, we multiply his total monthly income by 12:

\[ \text{Annual Income} = \$31500 \times 12 = \$378000 \]

Therefore, Tim will make \(\$378000\) in a year."

First, let's calculate the distance Alisa biked:
- Alisa's speed: 12 miles per hour
- Alisa's time: 4.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Alisa biked = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Stanley biked:
- Stanley's speed: 10 miles per hour
- Stanley's time: 2.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Stanley biked = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances together to find the total distance biked by both:
Total distance = Distance Alisa biked + Distance Stanley biked
Total distance = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

Therefore, Alisa and Stanley biked a total of 79 miles."
"To calculate the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to determine the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then sum these times.

1. **Time to dig through soil:**
   - Bill digs 4 feet per hour through soil.
   - He has to dig 24 feet of soil.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.

2. **Time to dig through clay:**
   - Bill digs half as fast through clay as he does through soil, so his speed through clay is 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour.
   - He has to dig 8 feet of clay.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

3. **Total time:**
   - Total time = Time through soil + Time through clay = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

**Final numerical answer:**
10 hours"
"To determine the total number of cupcakes Howie should buy, we need to consider the number of people who will receive cupcakes and the type of cupcakes each person will get.

1. Howie himself will get 2 cupcakes (one vanilla and one chocolate).
2. His teacher will get 2 cupcakes.
3. His 25 classmates will each get 2 cupcakes.

So, the total number of cupcakes for the classmates is \(25 \times 2 = 50\).

Adding the cupcakes for Howie and his teacher:
- Howie: 2 cupcakes
- Teacher: 2 cupcakes
- Classmates: 50 cupcakes

The total number of cupcakes Howie should buy is \(2 + 2 + 50 = 54\).

Therefore, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Fishio initially received 2000 likes on her photo.
2. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes. So, the number of likes after three weeks is \(2000 \times 70 = 140000\).
3. Recently, she received 20000 more new likes.

To find the total number of likes, we add the initial likes, the likes after three weeks, and the recent likes:

\[2000 + 140000 + 20000 = 162000\]

Therefore, the total number of Instagram likes is 162000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost Clara paid for her pomegranates on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the voucher was:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She got a $2 discount, so the final amount she paid was:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost Sheila paid for her pomegranates on Wednesday.

The price per pomegranate on Wednesday was $30, so the total cost before the discount was:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

She received a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount was:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final amount she paid was:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \text{ dollars} \]

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
\[ \boxed{142} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Ariadne's sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
2. The sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats in the first month. Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month were $400 * 2 = $800.
3. The total sales in the first month were the sum of red and green hat sales, which is $400 + $800 = $1200.
4. In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month were $1200 * (3/4) = $900.
5. The total sales over the two months would be the sum of the first month's sales and the second month's sales, which is $1200 + $900 = $2100.

Therefore, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is $2100."
"James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he is charged for 3 hours.

The first paid hour costs $15. Each hour after that costs twice as much, so the second hour costs $15 * 2 = $30, and the third hour costs $30 * 2 = $60.

Now, we add up the costs for the 3 hours:
$15 (first hour) + $30 (second hour) + $60 (third hour) = $105.

Therefore, James paid $105."
"Sally's bank account increased from $200 to $420 this week. The difference in her bank account balance is:

$420 - $200 = $220

$300 - $220 = $80

Therefore, $80 were withheld from Sally’s wage."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed.
2. Determine the number of whole eggs required.
3. Convert the number of whole eggs into dozens.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed.**

Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and there are 16 guests.
\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ deviled egg halves per guest} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of whole eggs required.**

Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many whole eggs are required for 48 deviled egg halves.
\[ \frac{48 \text{ deviled egg halves}}{2 \text{ deviled egg halves per egg}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs} \]

**Step 3: Convert the number of whole eggs into dozens.**

There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
\[ \frac{24 \text{ whole eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs per dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs."
"Shiela has already written 1/3 of the 15-page research paper. To find out how many pages she has written, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ pages} \]

\[ 15 - 5 = 10 \text{ pages} \]

She has 10 pages left to write."
"Mike plans to read 10 pages a day. The book has 200 pages.

To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read each day:

200 pages / 10 pages/day = 20 days

Mike will finish his reading in 20 days.

Therefore, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline (30 days - 20 days = 10 days)."
"To calculate the total cost for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly hanger rental cost, and the monthly fuel cost.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane**: $150,000
2. **Monthly Hanger Rental Cost**: $5,000
3. **Monthly Fuel Cost**: Twice the hanger rental cost, which is $5,000 * 2 = $10,000

Now, let's calculate the total monthly cost for maintaining the plane:
\[ \text{Total Monthly Cost} = \text{Hanger Rental Cost} + \text{Fuel Cost} = \$5,000 + \$10,000 = \$15,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the first year:
\[ \text{Total Yearly Cost} = \text{Total Monthly Cost} \times 12 = \$15,000 \times 12 = \$180,000 \]

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the yearly maintenance cost:
\[ \text{Total Cost for the First Year} = \text{Initial Cost} + \text{Total Yearly Cost} = \$150,000 + \$180,000 = \$330,000 \]

So, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is:
\[ \$330,000 \]"
"Given that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, we can use this information to find out the cooking times for the other ingredients.

1. **Cooking time for rice (R):** 30 minutes
2. **Cooking time for pork (P):** It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. So, \(P = R + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50\) minutes.
3. **Cooking time for beans (B):** Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. So, \(B = \frac{1}{2} (P + R) = \frac{1}{2} (50 + 30) = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40\) minutes.

To find the total cooking time for all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans:

\[ \text{Total cooking time} = R + P + B = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \]

So, it took Finley 120 minutes to cook all the food."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):

- Cost of 1/2 pound almonds: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5\) dollars
- Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars
- Total cost of the first mixture: \(5 + 5 = 10\) dollars

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):

- Cost of 1/5 pound almonds: \(\frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2\) dollars
- Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars
- Total cost of the second mixture: \(2 + 5 = 7\) dollars

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:

- Difference in cost: \(10 - 7 = 3\) dollars

Therefore, the first mixture costs $3 more than the second mixture."
"Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, and geese have 2 legs and 1 head. We can set up the following equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20:
\[ S + G = 20 \]

2. The total number of legs is 70:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
\[ S + G = 20 \]
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

To solve for \( S \) and \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The original brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

To find 20% of $5, we calculate:
\[ 5 \times 0.20 = 1 \]

So, the more expensive brand costs:
\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, which is 7 pounds (since he uses 1 pound per day). Therefore, the cost of the coffee for a week is:
\[ 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

He also buys a donut for $2. 

Adding the cost of the coffee and the donut together, we get:
\[ 42 + 2 = 44 \]

Total newspapers delivered in a day = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers - (Newspapers to District A + Newspapers to District C)

Let's calculate:

Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - (198 + 209)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 407
Newspapers delivered to District B = 193

James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."

"First, let's determine the number of history teachers on the basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

This means there are 90 history teachers. Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

So, there are 60 math teachers. Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

The math teachers collectively spend 360 hours sleeping in one day."
"First, let's determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's amount as follows:

\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, we know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's amount as follows:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, we add together the amounts of money that Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia have:

\[ \text{Total money} = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360 \]

If they decide to share the money equally among them, each person would get:

\[ \text{Each person's share} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \]

So, if they decide to add together their money and share equally among them, each would have \(\boxed{120}\) dollars."
"The game originally consists of 4 quarters, each 12 minutes long. So, the total time for the 4 quarters is:

4 quarters * 12 minutes/quarter = 48 minutes

"To determine how many good days were left in the month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total number of good days Christina had initially.
2. Add the good days from the next three days.
3. Subtract the total number of good days from the initial count plus the next three days from the total number of days in the month to find out how many good days were left.

Initially, Christina had 12 good days. The next three days included one good day, one neutral day, and one good day. So, the number of good days added from the next three days is 2.

Now, let's calculate the total number of good days:
\[ 12 \text{ (initial good days)} + 2 \text{ (good days from the next three days)} = 14 \text{ good days} \]

Since the total number of days in the month is 30, and we are only concerned with the good days, we do not need to subtract any bad or neutral days from the total. The question asks for the number of good days left in the month, which is simply the total number of good days calculated.

\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

Sally has 9 books."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches.
2. Calculate the total height increase needed for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.
3. Determine how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow the required additional height, given its daily growth rate.

Step 1: Convert the current height from feet to inches.
- 1 foot = 12 inches
- Current height = 20 feet = 20 * 12 inches = 240 inches

Step 2: Calculate the total height increase needed.
- Target height = 600 inches
- Current height = 240 inches
- Height increase needed = 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Step 3: Determine the number of days required.
- Daily growth rate = 30 inches/day
- Number of days required = Height increase needed / Daily growth rate = 360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are 8 more dogs, so now there are \(4 + 8 = 12\) dogs. James needs to buy 8 more toys, making the total \(4 + 8 = 12\) toys.
3. After buying the toys, the number of dogs doubles. So, the number of dogs becomes \(12 \times 2 = 24\). James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys, making the total \(12 + 12 = 24\) toys.
4. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so the number of dogs is now \(24 - 3 = 21\). Since these 3 dogs no longer need toys, James no longer needs to buy more toys for them. The total number of toys needed remains 24.

Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is \(\boxed{24}\)."

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer."
"First, let's determine Karen's hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:

\[ 2 \times \$10 = \$20 \text{ per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many hours Karen works in two days. If she works 3 hours per day, then in two days she works:

\[ 3 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate Karen's earnings for those 6 hours at her hourly rate of $20:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$120 \]

So, Karen earns \(\$120\) in two days."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple proportion based on the given information.

If 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, then the ratio of potatoes to hash browns is 6:36, which simplifies to 1:6. This means that for every potato, you can make 6 hash browns.

Now, if you have 96 potatoes, you can calculate the number of hash browns as follows:

\[ \text{Number of hash browns} = 96 \times 6 = 576 \]

So, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes."
"First, calculate the total weight of the 8 adults and Jack:

8 adults * 80 kg/adult = 640 kg
Jack's weight = 80 kg

Total weight = 640 kg + 80 kg = 720 kg

Now, subtract the maximum load of the elevator from the total weight to find out by how much they have exceeded the limit:

720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg

They will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"Given that Katarina has 68 cookies, we can work backwards to find out how many cookies Max and the Cookie Monster have.

1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has \(68 + 5 = 73\) cookies.
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has \(73 - 12 = 61\) cookies.
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has \(73 + 23 = 96\) cookies.

Now, to find the total number of cookies they have, we add up the cookies each one has:

\[68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298\]

They have a total of 298 cookies."
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the extension is \( 0.5x \) cm. Additionally, she adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom. Therefore, the total length of the dress after these modifications is:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 \]

We know that the final length of the dress is 140 cm. So, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, we divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]

\[ x = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

Final answer: 80"

First, we add the time spent so far:
6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

Now, we subtract the time already spent from the total time they have:
30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes

So, they have 11 minutes longer to get to school without being late."
"Catherine buys:
- 1 kilo of apples for $4
- 2 kilos of bananas for $2 per kilo, which totals $2 * 2 = $4
- 2 kilos of oranges for $3 per kilo, which totals $3 * 2 = $6

Adding these amounts together:
$4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14

Therefore, Catherine pays a total of $14."
"Greta bakes 30 cookies. Celinda bakes twice as many, which means Celinda bakes \(30 \times 2 = 60\) cookies.

Together, they bake \(30 + 60 = 90\) cookies.

They eat 10 of the cookies, so the number of cookies left is \(90 - 10 = 80\).

Therefore, there are 80 cookies in the box."
"Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as \( x \). Therefore, the age of the older triplet would be \( x + 7 \) because one twin is 7 years older than one triplet.

Since there is one set of twins, the age of each twin is the same. Let's denote the age of each twin as \( y \).

The combined ages of the four individuals (one twin, one triplet, and the other two triplets) are given as 44. So, we can write the equation as:

\[ y + (x + 7) + x + x = 44 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ y + 3x + 7 = 44 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ y + 3x = 37 \]

Since the twin's age \( y \) is the same as the age of the older triplet, we can substitute \( y \) with \( x + 7 \):

\[ (x + 7) + 3x = 37 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 4x + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 30 \]

Divide by 4:

\[ x = 7.5 \]

Now, the age of the twin is:

\[ y = x + 7 = 7.5 + 7 = 14.5 \]

So, one of the twins is 14.5 years old."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends on his homework:

- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Converting 3 hours into minutes:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner to find out how much time John has left for a nap:

180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

John has 100 minutes to nap."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the candies. We know that 4 candies cost $3.20, so the cost of 10 candies would be:

\[ \text{Cost of 10 candies} = \frac{10}{4} \times 3.20 = 2.50 \times 3.20 = 8.00 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 lollipops. Each lollipop costs $0.40, so:

\[ \text{Cost of 10 lollipops} = 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the 10 lollipops and the 10 candies to find the total cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8.00 + 4.00 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $12.00."
"First, let's calculate how many coins Rong saves in a month and then in a year. Rong saves 20 coins every month.

In a year, Rong saves:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 240 \text{ coins/year} \]

Now, let's determine how many coins Neil saves in a month. Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong each month. So, Neil saves:
\[ 20 \text{ coins} + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \text{ coins} \right) = 20 \text{ coins} + 8 \text{ coins} = 28 \text{ coins/month} \]

In a year, Neil saves:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 336 \text{ coins/year} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of coins saved by both Rong and Neil over ten years.

For Rong:
\[ 240 \text{ coins/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

For Neil:
\[ 336 \text{ coins/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding the total coins saved by both Rong and Neil:
\[ 2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

Therefore, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:
\[ 5760 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and the dog needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:

\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Let the total bill be \( T \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:

\[ 0.60 \times T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:

\[ T = 40 + 0.60 \times T \]

To find \( T \), we can rearrange the equation:

\[ T - 0.60 \times T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40 \times T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. Therefore, the amount he leaves with is:

\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

John leaves with $25."
"To find the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - Since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = \$1.0\).
   - There are 5 bananas in a crate, so the cost of bananas in a crate is \(5 \times 1.0 = \$5.0\).

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in a crate, so the cost of apples in a crate is \(12 \times 0.5 = \$6.0\).

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - Oranges cost three times as much as a banana.
   - Since one banana costs $1.0, one orange costs \(3 \times 1.0 = \$3.0\).
   - There are 7 oranges in a crate, so the cost of oranges in a crate is \(7 \times 3.0 = \$21.0\).

4. **Total Cost of the Crate:**
   - Sum the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges.
   - Total cost = Cost of bananas + Cost of apples + Cost of oranges
   - Total cost = \$5.0 + \$6.0 + \$21.0 = \$32.0

The price for such a crate of fruit is \(\$32.0\)."
"To find the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter, we need to determine the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares**: We are given that there are 14 red squares.
2. **Blue Squares**: There are 4 more blue squares than red squares. So, the number of blue squares is \(14 + 4 = 18\).
3. **Green Squares**: There are 6 more green squares than blue squares. So, the number of green squares is \(18 + 6 = 24\).
4. **White Squares**: There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. So, the number of white squares is \(24 - 12 = 12\).

Now, we sum up all the squares:
\[14 \text{ (red)} + 18 \text{ (blue)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 12 \text{ (white)} = 68\]

Therefore, the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter is \(\boxed{68}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of high chairs needed:**
   - The problem states that there are 8 high chairs.

2. **Calculate the number of regular chairs needed:**
   - The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs.
   - Therefore, the number of regular chairs = 5 * 8 = 40.

3. **Calculate the total number of chairs needed:**
   - The total number of chairs needed = number of high chairs + number of regular chairs.
   - Total chairs needed = 8 + 40 = 48.

4. **Determine the total number of people attending:**
   - There are 42 adults and 15 babies.
   - Total people = 42 + 15 = 57.

5. **Calculate the number of additional chairs needed:**

   - Since the total chairs available are 48, the additional chairs needed = 57 - 48 = 9.

Therefore, Mia has to get 9 more chairs."
"To find the number of 8 point bucks, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bucks in the field.
2. Calculate the number of 8 point bucks from the total number of bucks.

Step 1: Calculate the number of bucks.
50 percent of the 50 deer are bucks. So, we calculate:
\[ 50 \times \frac{50}{100} = 25 \]
There are 25 bucks in the field.

Step 2: Calculate the number of 8 point bucks.
20 percent of the bucks are 8 points. So, we calculate:
\[ 25 \times \frac{20}{100} = 5 \]
There are 5 8 point bucks in the field.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's calculate the points collected by each student:

1. Adam has 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. So, Betty's points are \(50 + 0.30 \times 50 = 50 + 15 = 65\) points.
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom's points are \(65 - 30 = 35\) points.
4. Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. So, Martha's points are \(3 \times 35 = 105\) points.

Now, let's sum up the points collected by all the students:
\[50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255\]

The class needs a total of 400 points to go on the trip. Therefore, the points the class is missing are:

The class is missing \(\boxed{145}\) points to go on the trip."
"To determine the number of great-grandbabies at the family reunion, we can break down the family structure step by step.

1. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.
2. Each of her children has 3 children of their own, so the number of grandchildren is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).
3. Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies of their own, so the number of great-grandbabies is \(9 \times 3 = 27\).

Therefore, the number of great-grandbabies at the family reunion is 27."
"First, let's calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400 paycheck into her retirement account:

\[ 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

So, she puts $1200 into her retirement account.

Next, we calculate how much she uses for her monthly car payment. She uses 20% of her paycheck for this:

\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

So, she uses $480 for her car payment.

Now, we subtract the amounts she has spent from her total paycheck to find out how much she has left to spend:

\[ 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Therefore, Greta has $720 left to spend."

"First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks set off by the city:

- The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each.
- Total fireworks from the city = 15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = 300 fireworks.

Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks:

- Hannah's view of the city's fireworks = 40% of 300 = 0.40 * 300 = 120 fireworks.

Next, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah sets off in her backyard:

- Hannah is setting off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each.
- Total fireworks from Hannah = 3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = 15 fireworks.

Now, we add the fireworks Hannah sees from the city and the fireworks she sets off herself:

- Total fireworks Hannah sees = 120 (city fireworks) + 15 (her own fireworks) = 135 fireworks.

Therefore, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is 135."
"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person saves a seat and buys enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats. Since each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks, and there are 20 people, the group will buy:

- \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) drinks
- \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) snacks

Each drink and snack costs $2, so the total cost for drinks is:

\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

And the total cost for snacks is:

\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount spent on drinks and snacks:

Therefore, the group has spent a total of:

\[ \boxed{200} \] dollars on snacks and drinks."
"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we can calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4,000 \, \text{pounds} + 800 \, \text{pounds} = 4,800 \, \text{pounds} \]

Next, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. We can use this information to find out how much Gary's truck can haul. We already know the capacities of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + \text{Gordy's truck capacity} + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11,600 \, \text{pounds} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 4,000 \, \text{pounds} + 4,800 \, \text{pounds} + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11,600 \, \text{pounds} \]

Now, we can solve for Gary's truck capacity:

\[ 8,800 \, \text{pounds} + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11,600 \, \text{pounds} \]

\[ \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11,600 \, \text{pounds} - 8,800 \, \text{pounds} = 2,800 \, \text{pounds} \]

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel."

1. Each female ate 3 dumplings.
2. There are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is \(6 \times 3 = 18\).

3. Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate \(3 + 1 = 4\) dumplings.
4. There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is \(8 \times 4 = 32\).

5. The total number of dumplings cooked is the sum of dumplings eaten by males and females, which is \(18 + 32 = 50\).

Therefore, Larry cooked 50 dumplings."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much money Gerald and Julia each received when they divided $100 in the ratio 3:2.

The total parts of the ratio 3:2 add up to 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Each part is therefore worth $100 / 5 = $20.

Gerald's share, being 3 parts, is 3 * $20 = $60.

Julia's share, being 2 parts, is 2 * $20 = $40.

If Gerald spent $10 on a book, the amount of money he has left is $60 - $10 = $50.

Therefore, Gerald has $50 left."
"First, let's determine the speed of Martha's turtle. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and the cat can run at 15 feet/second, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Turtle's speed} \times \text{Time} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find out how many more hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first need to determine how much more money they need to raise. 

The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount they need to raise is:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money they raise per hour. From the information given, in the first 3 hours, they raised $2100. Therefore, the amount raised per hour is:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Now, to find out how many more hours they need to fundraise to raise the remaining $4200, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

So, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours. 

Therefore, the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal is the initial 3 hours plus the additional 6 hours:

\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]

**Final numerical answer:**

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract the industrial usage from the total city usage to find the non-industrial usage.

Step 1: The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. So, the industrial usage is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 \text{ or } 32\% \]

Step 2: The total city usage is 40%, and the industrial usage is 32%. Therefore, the non-industrial usage is:
\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

So, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

8%"

Therefore, Alex charges $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the production rate for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream and then calculate the total production over 48 hours.

First, let's find the production rate for chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Next, let's find the production rate for vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Now, we calculate the total production for each type of ice cream over 48 hours:
- For chocolate ice cream: \( 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).
- For vanilla ice cream: \( 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Finally, we add the total production of both types of ice cream to get the total production in 48 hours:
- Total production = \( 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \).

Therefore, the total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 3000."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Marcus ordered:

- Croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each = 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each = 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 muffins at $1.00 each = 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total before the discount:

Total before discount = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off, we need to calculate 10% of $50.00 and subtract it from the total:

10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Subtracting the discount from the total:

Total after discount = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is $45.00."
"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin should buy, we need to understand the deal and how it affects the number of scoops she can get with her $6.00.

1. The deal is ""buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free."" This means for every 3 scoops, Erin only pays for 2.
2. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's calculate the cost for 3 scoops under the deal:
- Cost for 2 scoops = 2 * $1.50 = $3.00
- Since the 3rd scoop is free, the total cost for 3 scoops is $3.00.

Now, let's see how many sets of 3 scoops Erin can get with $6.00:
- $6.00 / $3.00 per set = 2 sets

Since each set gives her 3 scoops, the total number of scoops she can get is:
- 2 sets * 3 scoops per set = 6 scoops

Therefore, Erin should buy 2 sets of 2 scoops to get a total of 6 scoops of ice cream.

"To find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy each person eats in two weeks and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total amount of candy Ginger eats in two weeks:
- Ginger eats 4 pieces a day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- So, Ginger eats \(4 \times 14 = 56\) pieces of candy in two weeks.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of candy Amy eats in two weeks:
- Amy eats 3 pieces a day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- So, Amy eats \(3 \times 14 = 42\) pieces of candy in two weeks.

Now, we need to find out how much candy each person has left after two weeks:
- Ginger started with 100 pieces and ate 56 pieces, so she has \(100 - 56 = 44\) pieces left.
- Amy started with 100 pieces and ate 42 pieces, so she has \(100 - 42 = 58\) pieces left.

Finally, we need to find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger:
- Amy has 58 pieces and Ginger has 44 pieces.
- The difference is \(58 - 44 = 14\).

So, after two weeks, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger.

"To find out how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the area that needs to be covered: two thirds of the 36 sq ft bathroom.
2. Determine the number of tiles needed for that area, given that 24 tiles are required per square foot.

First, calculate two thirds of the bathroom area:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \text{ sq ft} = 24 \text{ sq ft} \]

Next, since Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles per square foot, we multiply the area to be covered by the number of tiles per square foot:
\[ 24 \text{ sq ft} \times 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft} = 576 \text{ tiles} \]

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom."
"To determine how much James saved, we need to calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries and compare it to the cost of buying the same amount at the store.

1. **Cost of picking the blueberries:**
   - Initial cost to go picking: $20
   - Cost per pound: $1.5
   - Pounds of blueberries picked: 30

   Total cost for picking = Initial cost + (Cost per pound * Pounds picked)
   Total cost for picking = $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
   Total cost for picking = $20 + $45
   Total cost for picking = $65

2. **Cost of buying the blueberries at the store:**
   - Price per pound at the store: $2.5
   - Pounds of blueberries: 30

   Total cost at the store = Price per pound * Pounds
   Total cost at the store = $2.5 * 30
   Total cost at the store = $75

3. **Savings:**
   - Savings = Total cost at the store - Total cost for picking
   - Savings = $75 - $65
   - Savings = $10

James saved $10 compared to buying the blueberries at the store.

"First, let's calculate the new price of each computer after the 10% increase.

The original planned price per computer was $700. A 10% increase on $700 is calculated as follows:
\[ 700 \times 0.10 = 70 \]

So, the new price per computer is:
\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money the company paid to buy 500 computers at the new price, we multiply the new price per computer by the number of computers:
\[ 770 \times 500 = 385,000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:
\[ 385,000 \]"
"To calculate the total calories in John's omelet, we need to consider the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

1. **Eggs**: John uses 6 eggs. Each egg is 75 calories.
   \[
   6 \text{ eggs} \times 75 \text{ calories/egg} = 450 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Cheese**: John uses 2 oz of cheese. Cheese is 120 calories per ounce.
   \[
   2 \text{ oz} \times 120 \text{ calories/oz} = 240 \text{ calories}

- Total cost: \(\$3.00 + \$2.00 = \$5.00\)

Since you paid with $10, the change you would get is:

- Change: \(\$10.00 - \$5.00 = \$5.00\)

Therefore, the change you would get is \$5.00."
"First, let's calculate the number of people who receive interviews. Since 30% of the 100 applicants receive interviews:

\[ 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \]

Next, we calculate the number of people who receive a job offer. Since 20% of those who receive interviews get a job offer:

\[ 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \]

Finally, we calculate the number of people who accept the position. Since a third of those who receive a job offer accept it:

\[ 6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2 \]

So, the number of people who accept the position is:

\[ 2 \]"
"Goldy gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother, which totals 3 + 4 = 7 sacks.

"To find the total number of taps Helga makes, we need to calculate the taps for the time her arms are down and the time her arms are raised separately, then add them together.

1. **With arms down:**
   - She dances for \(5 - 2 = 3\) minutes with her arms down.
   - Right foot: \(300 \, \text{taps/minute} \times 3 \, \text{minutes} = 900 \, \text{taps}\)
   - Left foot: \(250 \, \text{taps/minute} \times 3 \, \text{minutes} = 750 \, \text{taps}\)
   - Total taps with arms down: \(900 + 750 = 1650 \, \text{taps}\)

2. **With arms raised:**
   - She dances for \(2\) minutes with her arms raised.
   - Right foot: \(200 \, \text{taps/minute} \times 2 \, \text{minutes} = 400 \, \text{taps}\)
   - Left foot: \(200 \, \text{taps/minute} \times 2 \, \text{minutes} = 400 \, \text{taps}\)
   - Total taps with arms raised: \(400 + 400 = 800 \, \text{taps}\)

3. **Combined total:**
   - Total taps: \(1650 + 800 = 2450 \, \text{taps}\)

The combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet is **2450**."
"To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of having the city fix it and the total cost of Ron fixing it himself, then find the difference between these two amounts.

1. **Cost of having the city fix the pothole:**
   - The pothole will do $450 worth of damage to Ron's car if it's not fixed.
   - The city council will fine Ron $120 for fixing it himself.
   - Therefore, the total cost if the city fixes it is $450 (damage to car) - $120 (fine) = $330.

2. **Cost of Ron fixing the pothole himself:**
   - Ron will have to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, each costing $25.
   - The total cost for the asphalt is 3 buckets * $25/bucket = $75.
   - Ron will also have to pay the $120 fine for unauthorized road maintenance.
   - Therefore, the total cost if Ron fixes it himself is $75 (asphalt) + $120 (fine) = $195.

3. **Savings by fixing the pothole himself:**
   - The savings is the difference between the cost of having the city fix it and the cost of Ron fixing it himself.
   - Savings = $330 (city fixing) - $195 (Ron fixing) = $135.

Ron saves $135 by fixing the pothole himself.

**Final Answer:**
$135"
"To find out how many chairs the restaurant has left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

First, let's calculate the remaining normal chairs:
- Total normal chairs: 170
- Normal chairs sent for repair: 20
- Remaining normal chairs: \(170 - 20 = 150\)

Next, let's calculate the remaining baby chairs:
- Total baby chairs: 23
- Baby chairs sent for repair: 13
- Remaining baby chairs: \(23 - 13 = 10\)

Now, we add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs to get the total number of chairs left:
- Total remaining chairs: \(150 + 10 = 160\)

Therefore, the restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pizzas ordered. Since there are 5 people (Bryce and his four friends) and each ordered one pizza, the total number of pizzas is 5.

Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends. Each of these three people ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizza. Therefore, the number of slices each of them ate is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \]
Since there are three of them, the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends is:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we calculate the number of slices eaten by the two remaining friends. Each of these two friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizza. Therefore, the number of slices each of them ate is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \]
Since there are two of them, the total number of slices eaten by the two remaining friends is:
\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

The total number of slices eaten by all five friends is:
\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \]

Finally, the number of slices left is the total number of slices minus the number of slices eaten:
\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \]

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is:
\[ 18 \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. The dog can eat the sausages in \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the time the cat takes. Since the cat takes 30 minutes, the dog takes:

\[ 30 \times \frac{2}{3} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, to find the average time the two take to eat the sausages, we add the time it takes for the cat and the dog to eat the sausages and then divide by 2:

\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

The average time the two take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes."
"First, let's convert the length of one of Topher's shoes into inches. Topher's shoe length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the feet to inches and then add the additional 4 inches:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]
\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, Topher's shoe is 100 inches long.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher’s shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby’s shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby’s shoes as \( x \) inches. The relationship can be expressed as:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby’s shoes is 10 inches.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for both students' cars and teachers' cars, and then sum these values.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each student's car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The number of students' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 64 = 16 \]

Since each of these 16 cars has 4 windows, the total number of windows smashed for the students' cars is:
\[ 16 \times 4 = 64 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teacher's car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

The number of teachers' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 32 = 24 \]

Since each of these 24 cars has 2 windows, the total number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars is:
\[ 24 \times 2 = 48 \]

Finally, we sum the windows smashed for both students' and teachers' cars:
\[ 64 + 48 = 112 \]

Therefore, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:
\[ \boxed{112} \]"
"To find the percentage of spools that are blue, we first need to determine the total number of spools and the number of blue spools.

Candy has:
- 15 light blue spools
- 45 dark blue spools
- 40 light green spools
- 50 dark green spools

The total number of spools is:
\[ 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 \]

The number of blue spools (both light and dark blue) is:
\[ 15 + 45 = 60 \]

To find the percentage of spools that are blue, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\% \]

Therefore, 40% of her spools are blue."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of people**: 5000

2. **People who voted by midday (12:00)**: \( \frac{2}{5} \) of 5000
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000
   \]
   So, 2000 people voted by midday.

3. **Remaining people after midday**: 
   \[
   5000 - 2000 = 3000
   \]

4. **People who voted by 16:00**: \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining 3000 people
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000

"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need for 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will need for 30 days.
2. Determine how many packs of gum are required based on the number of pieces per pack.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces of gum needed.
Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. For 30 days, he will need:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Step 2: Determine the number of packs needed.
Each pack contains 15 pieces of gum. To find out how many packs are needed for 120 pieces, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of smores needed:**
   - **Kids:** 9 kids want 2 smores each, so \(9 \times 2 = 18\) smores.
   - **Adults:** 6 adults will eat 1 smore each, so \(6 \times 1 = 6\) smores.
   - **Total smores needed:** \(18 + 6 = 24\) smores.

2. **Calculate the number of smores that can be made from one box of graham crackers:**
   - Each sleeve makes 8 smores, and there are 3 sleeves in a box.
   - So, one box can make \(3 \times 8 = 24\) smores.

3. **Determine the number of boxes needed:**
   - Since one box can make 24 smores, and we need 24 smores, we need exactly 1 box.

Therefore, they will need **1 box** of graham crackers."
"First, let's calculate Dora's father's age. Given that Dora is 15 years old, and her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age, we can express this as:

\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 \]

Substituting Dora's age:

\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we calculate Dora's mother's age. Since Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father:

\[ \text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:

\[ \text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} \]
\[ \text{Total combined age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

Therefore, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87."
"To solve this problem, we need to divide the total amount of money Greg found by the number of people who will share it, including Greg and his 3 siblings.

\[ 20\% \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes} \]

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes. So, candidate B received:
\[ 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ votes} \]

The total votes for candidates A and B are:
\[ 20 + 30 = 50 \text{ votes} \]

The rest of the votes were given to candidate C. Since there were 100 voters in total, the number of votes for candidate C is:
\[ 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ votes} \]

Therefore, candidate C got 50 votes."
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, Beck has:

\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \text{ apples} \]

Next, if Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Boris will have:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \text{ apples} \]

And Beck will have:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \text{ apples} \]

Now, to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this exchange, we subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris.

"To determine how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract that from the initial 32 ounces.

1. **Giant Cubes:**
   - Each giant cube uses 4 ounces.
   - Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   - Total water used for giant cubes: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) ounces.

2. **Medium Cubes:**
   - Each medium cube uses 2 ounces.
   - Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   - Total water used for medium cubes: \(7 \times 2 = 14\) ounces.

3. **Small Cubes:**
   - Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces.
   - Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   - Total water used for small cubes: \(8 \times 0.5 = 4\) ounces.

Now, we add up the total water used for all the cubes:
\[12 \text{ ounces (giant cubes)} + 14 \text{ ounces (medium cubes)} + 4 \text{ ounces (small cubes)} = 30 \text{ ounces}\]

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial 32 ounces:

"Given that Clara has 20 books and she has twice as many books as Steven, we can determine that Steven has:

\[ \text{Steven's books} = \frac{\text{Clara's books}}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Since Alice has 6 more books than Steven, Alice has:

\[ \text{Alice's books} = \text{Steven's books} + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:

\[ \text{Clara's books} - \text{Alice's books} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice."
"Given that a gallon jar costs $5 and it costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can determine the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

\[ \text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]
\[ \text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total amount of money spent:

Therefore, the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars is $98."
"To find out how many students like to play video games, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students who like to bake or play basketball.
2. Subtract this number from the total number of students to find out how many like to play video games or play music.
3. Use the given relationship between the number of students who like to play music and those who like to play basketball to find the exact number of students who like to play video games.

Step 1: The number of students who like to bake is 10, and the number who like to play basketball is 5. So, the total number of students who like to bake or play basketball is:
\[ 10 + 5 = 15 \]

Step 2: Subtract the number of students who like to bake or play basketball from the total number of students to find out how many like to play video games or play music:
\[ 50 - 15 = 35 \]

Step 3: According to the problem, the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is the remaining number after subtracting the number of students who like to play music from the 35 students who like to play video games or music:
\[ 35 - 10 = 25 \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the packs Mark bought:

3 packs * $1800 per pack = $5400

Next, let's calculate the total value of the cards he received:

- One card is worth $4000
- Another card is worth $1000
- 30 more cards are worth an average of $50 each, so the total value of these cards is 30 * $50 = $1500

Adding these values together gives the total value of all the cards:

$4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:

$6500 - $5400 = $1100

1. The cost per tomato with the new vendor is $0.40.
2. The cost per tomato with the old vendor was $0.50.
3. The difference in cost per tomato is $0.50 - $0.40 = $0.10.
4. The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day, so the daily savings are $0.10 * 500 = $50.
5. There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly savings are $50 * 7 = $350.

The vendor saves $350 a week."
"Given that Sean has 56 marbles, and Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, we can determine the number of marbles Cal has:

Cal's marbles = 2 * Sean's marbles
Cal's marbles = 2 * 56
Cal's marbles = 112

Next, since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean:

Carl's marbles = 4 * Sean's marbles
Carl's marbles = 4 * 56
Carl's marbles = 224

To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined:

Total marbles = Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles
Total marbles = 224 + 112
Total marbles = 336

"First, we determine how many students are in each of the six groups by dividing the total number of students by the number of groups:

\[ \frac{54}{6} = 9 \]

This means each of the six groups has 9 students.

Next, we need to find out how many students are required for each of the 12 groups if the activity requires 12 groups. Since the number of students per group should remain the same, we use the number of students per group from the initial setup:

\[ 9 \text{ students per group} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of students needed for 12 groups:

\[ 9 \times 12 = 108 \]

Since we only have 54 students, we need to find out how many more students are required to form 12 groups:

\[ 108 - 54 = 54 \]

However, the question asks for the number of additional groups needed, not the number of additional students. Since we already have 6 groups and need a total of 12 groups, the number of additional groups required is:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

So, the number of additional groups needed is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

1. **Weekday Rentals:**
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays.
   - Since 60 chairs are rented each weekday, the total number of chairs rented during weekdays in one 4-week month is \(60 \times 20 = 1200\) chairs.

2. **Weekend Rentals:**
   - There are 2 weekend days in a week.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.
   - Since 100 chairs are rented each weekend day, the total number of chairs rented during weekends in one 4-week month is \(100 \times 8 = 800\) chairs.

3. **Total Rentals in One 4-Week Month:**
   - The total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month is the sum of weekday and weekend rentals, which is \(1200 + 800 = 2000\) chairs.

4. **Total Rentals in Two 4-Week Months:**

Therefore, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is **4000**."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Gunther initially had 48 bananas.
2. Arnold stole half of the bananas, so Arnold took \( \frac{48}{2} = 24 \) bananas. This left Gunther with \( 48 - 24 = 24 \) bananas.
3. The next day, Gunther added 25 more bananas to his pile, making the total \( 24 + 25 = 49 \) bananas.
4. Arnold then stole 12 bananas, leaving Gunther with \( 49 - 12 = 37 \) bananas.
5. On the third day, Gunther added another 6 bananas, making the total \( 37 + 6 = 43 \) bananas.

So, the final number of bananas in the pile is 43."
"First, let's calculate the monthly share for each roommate:

Total monthly electricity bill = $100
Number of roommates = 4

Monthly share per roommate = Total monthly electricity bill / Number of roommates
Monthly share per roommate = $100 / 4
Monthly share per roommate = $25

Next, we calculate the annual share for each roommate:

Number of months in a year = 12

Annual share per roommate = Monthly share per roommate * Number of months in a year
Annual share per roommate = $25 * 12
Annual share per roommate = $300

Each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."
"Jeff initially sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates for the party.

8 dozen glasses = 8 * 12 = 96 glasses
4 dozen plates = 4 * 12 = 48 plates

10 glasses were broken, so the number of glasses left is:
96 - 10 = 86 glasses

6 plates were broken, so the number of plates left is:
48 - 6 = 42 plates

Therefore, Jeff now has 86 glasses and 42 plates.

Final numerical answer:
86 glasses and 42 plates"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers and Conversion Rates:**
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.
   - A small sticker is worth one small button.
   - A large button is worth three small stickers.

2. **Lorraine's Initial Stickers:**
   - 30 small stickers
   - 40 large stickers

3. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons.

5. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small stickers, so 20 large stickers = 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 60 small stickers = 60 small buttons.

6. **Total Buttons:**
   - From small stickers: 27 small buttons
   - From large stickers: 20 large buttons (which are equivalent to 20 large buttons)
   - From remaining large stickers: 60 small buttons

7. **Final Calculation:**
   - Total buttons = 27 (from small stickers) + 20 (from large stickers) + 60 (from remaining large stickers) = 107 buttons.

**Final Answer:**

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against the regulation. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into this expression:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need size extra-small.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra-small. So, \(2 \times 11 = 22\) students need size small.
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So, \(22 - 4 = 18\) students need size medium.
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. So, \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\) students need size large.
5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. So, \(9 + 6 = 15\) students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up all the shirts:

- XS: 11
- S: 22
- M: 18
- L: 9
- XL: 15

Total number of shirts = \(11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75\)

Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera."
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3.5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 3.5:
\[ x = \frac{250}{3.5} = \frac{2500}{35} = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases of shingles, so:
\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Therefore, the third house will need approximately 142.86 cases of shingles. Since the problem asks for a final numerical answer, we can round to the nearest whole number if necessary, but the exact answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the Llesis family, which is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked.

1. **Calculate the distance driven:**
   - They drove for 4.5 hours (since the total time was 6 hours and they hiked for 1.5 hours).
   - Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour.
   - Distance driven = Time driven × Speed = 4.5 hours × 50 miles/hour = 225 miles.

2. **Calculate the hiking speed:**
   - The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
   - Half their driving speed = 50 miles/hour / 2 = 25 miles/hour.
   - Hiking speed = 25 miles/hour - 5 miles/hour = 20 miles/hour.

3. **Calculate the distance hiked:**
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours.
   - Distance hiked = Time hiked × Hiking speed = 1.5 hours × 20 miles/hour = 30 miles.

"Let's break down the scoring for both Ava and Emma based on the given information:

1. **Enemies Jumped On:**
   - Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
   - Points for each enemy = 10 points.
   - If Emma jumps on \(E\) enemies, then Ava jumps on \(E + 8\) enemies.
   - Emma's score from enemies = \(10E\).
   - Ava's score from enemies = \(10(E + 8) = 10E + 80\).

2. **Berries Collected:**
   - Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
   - Points for each berry = 5 points.
   - If Emma collects \(B\) berries, then Ava collects \(B + 3\) berries.
   - Emma's score from berries = \(5B\).
   - Ava's score from berries = \(5(B + 3) = 5B + 15\).

3. **Time Left on the Timer:**
   - Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma.
   - Points for each second left = 30 points.
   - If Emma has \(T\) seconds left, then Ava has \(T + 4\) seconds left.
   - Emma's score from time = \(30T\).
   - Ava's score from time = \(30(T + 4) = 30T + 120\).

Now, let's calculate the total scores for both:

- Emma's total score = \(10E + 5B + 30T\).
- Ava's total score = \(10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T + 120 = 10E + 5B + 30T + 115\).

The difference between their scores is:

1. The total cost of the four pizzas is $64.
2. Two of the pizzas cost $30 in total.
3. We need to find the cost of each of the other two pizzas, which cost the same amount.

First, we calculate the total cost of the other two pizzas:
\[ \text{Total cost of four pizzas} - \text{Total cost of two pizzas} = \text{Total cost of other two pizzas} \]
\[ 64 - 30 = 34 \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of these two pizzas by 2:
\[ \text{Cost of each of the other two pizzas} = \frac{34}{2} = 17 \]

So, each of the other two pizzas cost $17.

3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides

On the other two days, they ride twice the times they do on the usual days. So, on those days, they ride:

2 * 3 rides/day = 6 rides/day

For the two days, the total number of rides is:

6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 rides

Adding the rides from the 5 days and the 2 days together gives the total number of rides in a week:

15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond: 3 orange and 4 white.

He bought 17 more fish from the pet store, and after adding these to his pond, the number of orange fish became twice the number of white fish.

Let's denote the number of orange fish he bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish he bought as \( W \). Therefore, \( O + W = 17 \).

After adding the new fish, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + O \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + W \).

According to the problem, after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Now, let's solve these equations.

First, simplify the equation:
\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]
\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

We also have the equation from the total number of fish bought:
\[ O + W = 17 \]

We can solve these two equations simultaneously. From the second equation, we can express \( O \) in terms of \( W \):
\[ O = 17 - W \]

Substitute this into the first equation:
\[ 17 - W - 2W = 5 \]
\[ 17 - 3W = 5 \]
\[ -3W = 5 - 17 \]
\[ -3W = -12 \]
\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

Final answer:

Andy's car has a fuel efficiency of 10 miles per gallon. Therefore, the amount of fuel used for 50 miles is:
\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the fuel used.**

The price of regular gas is $3 per gallon. Therefore, the cost for 5 gallons is:
\[ 5 \text{ gallons} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received from her aunt.

Carrie was given ten twenties, which is:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

She was also given 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount from the quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Carrie received is:
\[ 200 + 35 = 235 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she spent. She spent \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the twenties and all the quarters.

The amount spent on the twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount spent on the quarters is:
\[ 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money she paid for the lunch is:
\[ 120 + 35 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

Final answer:
\[ 155 \]"
"To find out how many fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants.
- Therefore, the total number of tomatoes is \(22 \times 5 = 110\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.
- Therefore, the total number of eggplants is \(4 \times 8 = 32\).

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:
- Total number of fruits = Total number of tomatoes + Total number of eggplants
- Total number of fruits = \(110 + 32 = 142\).

Therefore, Ricardo can get 142 fruits from his plants."
"To find out how many OLED TVs Samwell sold, we first need to calculate the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold, and then subtract these from the total number of TVs sold.

1. Calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
   \[ \text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

2. Calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
   \[ \text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \]

3. Calculate the number of OLED TVs sold by subtracting the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total:
   \[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (\text{Number of smart TVs} + \text{Number of analog TVs}) \]
   \[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (10 + 5) = 40 - 15 = 25 \]

So, Samwell was able to sell 25 OLED TVs."
"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total cost of the trip.
2. Calculate the amount the school will cover.
3. Calculate the amount John still needs to raise.
4. Subtract the amount John already has from the amount he still needs to raise.

Let's go through these steps:

1. The total cost of the trip is $300.
2. The school will cover half of the cost, so the school's contribution is \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \) dollars.
3. The remaining cost that John needs to cover is \( 300 - 150 = 150 \) dollars.
4. John already has $50, so the amount he still needs to raise is \( 150 - 50 = 100 \) dollars.

Therefore, the amount of money John is missing is $100."
"First, we need to determine the temperature during the night. If it's 33 degrees colder at night than during the day, and the day temperature was 45 degrees, then the night temperature is:

\[ 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, we need to find out how much the temperature needs to be raised to prevent the pipes from freezing. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. So, we need to raise the temperature from 12 degrees to 32 degrees:

\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Since each log of wood burns raises the temperature by 5 degrees, we need to calculate how many logs are required to raise the temperature by 20 degrees:

\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing."
"First, we need to determine the number of 9-person groups that can be formed from 90 people. This is calculated by dividing the total number of people by the group size:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{90}{9} = 10 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups are part of the 3/5 fraction that each brings back 2 seashells. We calculate 3/5 of the total number of groups:

\[ \text{Number of groups bringing seashells} = \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]

Each of these 6 groups brings back 2 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is:

\[ \text{Total seashells} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the changes in the number of people on the train step by step.

1. Initially, there are 172 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 47 people get off and 13 more get on. So, the change in the number of people is -47 + 13 = -34. Therefore, the number of people on the train after the first stop is 172 - 34 = 138.
3. At the next stop, 38 people get off. So, the change in the number of people is -38. Therefore, the number of people on the train after the second stop is 138 - 38 = 100.

The final number of people on the train is 100."
"To calculate how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many bottle caps Damien finds in a day.
2. Calculate the value of the bottle caps he finds in a day.
3. Multiply the daily value by the number of days in the month.

Step 1: Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day.

Step 2: Each bottle cap is worth $0.25, so the value of the bottle caps he finds in a day is:
\[ 10 \text{ bottle caps/day} \times \$0.25/\text{bottle cap} = \$2.50/\text{day} \]

Step 3: To find out how much money he makes in a 30-day month, we multiply the daily value by 30:
\[ \$2.50/\text{day} \times 30 \text{ days} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, Damien makes \(\$75.00\) in a 30-day month."
"First, let's calculate Jamie's regular pay for the 8 hours she works each day at her regular rate of $20 per hour.

Regular pay for 8 hours = 8 hours * $20/hour = $160

Since Jamie worked 11 hours on Tuesday, she worked 3 additional hours beyond her regular 8-hour workday. For these additional hours, she is paid at a rate that is 150% of her regular hourly rate.

The special hourly rate for additional hours is:
150% of $20 = 1.5 * $20 = $30 per hour

Now, let's calculate the pay for the 3 additional hours:
Pay for 3 additional hours = 3 hours * $30/hour = $90

Finally, we add the regular pay and the pay for the additional hours to find the total pay for the day:
Total pay = Regular pay + Pay for additional hours
Total pay = $160 + $90 = $250

Therefore, Jamie was paid $250 for her work on Tuesday."
"The zookeeper counts 12 female lions. There are half as many male lions, which means there are \(12 \div 2 = 6\) male lions. Additionally, there are 14 lion cubs.

To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and cubs together:

\[12 + 6 + 14 = 32\]

There are 32 lions in the enclosure."
"First, we need to calculate the discount on the jeans. The jeans are 25% off, and the original price is $40. 

To find the discount amount, we calculate 25% of $40:
\[ 25\% \times 40 = 0.25 \times 40 = 10 \]

So, the discount is $10. 

Next, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

The sale price of the jeans is $30. 

Mike pays with a $50.00 bill. To find out how much money he will have left over, we subtract the sale price of the jeans from the amount he paid:
\[ 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, Mike will have $20.00 left over."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Billy's Salary Calculation:**
   - Initial rate: $10 per hour
   - After 2 months, raise: $0.50 per hour, so new rate: $10.50 per hour
   - On his first anniversary, raise: $1.00 per hour, so final rate: $11.50 per hour

   Since both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, we calculate Billy's earnings as:
   \[
   \text{Billy's earnings} = 20 \times 11.50 = 230 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Sally's Salary Calculation:**
   - Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, so Sally's rate is:
   \[
   10 + 0.50 = 10.50 \text{ dollars per hour}
   \]
   - Sally's earnings for 20 hours are:
   \[
   \text{Sally's earnings} = 20 \times 10.50 = 210 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Difference in Earnings:**
   - The difference in earnings between Billy and Sally is:
   \[
   230 - 210 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, Billy will earn $20 more than Sally."

"To calculate the total number of trees planted, we need to consider both the students and the teachers' contributions.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students:
- There are 40 classes, and each class has 25 students.
- Therefore, the total number of students is \(40 \times 25 = 1000\).
- Each student plants 1 tree, so the students will plant \(1000 \times 1 = 1000\) trees.

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- There are 40 classes, and each class has 3 teachers.
- Therefore, the total number of teachers is \(40 \times 3 = 120\).
- Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the teachers will plant \(120 \times 2 = 240\) trees.

Now, we add the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers to get the total number of trees planted:
- Total trees = trees planted by students + trees planted by teachers
- Total trees = \(1000 + 240 = 1240\)

Therefore, at the end of the campaign, they will have planted 1240 trees."
"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total current stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the first part of her schedule:

- She plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks have 14 days.
- Half an hour each day for 14 days is \(0.5 \times 14 = 7\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the total hours for the second part of her schedule:

- She plays for 2 hours every day for a week, which is 7 days.
- 2 hours each day for 7 days is \(2 \times 7 = 14\) hours.

Now, let's add the hours from both parts of her schedule:

- Total hours played = \(7 + 14 = 21\) hours.

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. So, the number of hours she still needs to play is:

- \(30 - 21 = 9\) hours.

Therefore, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. The first car travels at 60 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it will travel:
   \[
   60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. The second car travels at 70 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it will travel:
   \[
   70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}

Therefore, James paid $1170 for the ring."
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students, then divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students.

First, let's calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders, so it's \(2 \times \frac{40}{100} = \frac{80}{100} = 0.8\). Therefore, 400 fifth-graders had \(400 \times 0.8 = 320\) pass.

Now, let's sum up the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total students who passed: \(340 + 40 + 320 = 680\)
- Total students: \(500 + 100 + 400 = 1000\)

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students:

\[
\text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{680}{1000} = 0.68
\]

Expressing this as a percentage:

\[
0.68 \times 100 = 68\%
\]

The school's overall pass rate is 68%."
"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of the mosaic he can make with the total number of chips.
3. Calculate the length of the mosaic given its height.

First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has in total. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:
\[ 72 \times 2 = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to determine how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, the number of square inches he can make is:
\[ \frac{144}{12} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long the mosaic can be, we divide the total area (in square inches) by the height (in inches):
\[ \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the length of the mosaic Milo can make is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts, so the total amount they drank is:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts, so the total amount they drank is:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts. Therefore, the total amount of tea in gallons is:

"Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 butterscotch candies, which means he needed to order more to meet the demand. He then ordered an additional 100 candies. 

To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he now has and then subtract the number of candies he has already sold.

Total candies Dale has now = Initial candies + Additional ordered candies
Total candies Dale has now = 100 + 100 = 200

Candies already sold = 150

Candies still to be sold = Total candies - Candies already sold
Candies still to be sold = 200 - 150 = 50

Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month, starting from the beginning of the year, and then find the difference between the number of students at the end of May and the initial number of students.

1. **Beginning of the year (January):** 10 students
2. **End of January:** The number of students doubles, so \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
3. **End of February:** The number of students doubles again, so \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
4. **End of March:** The number of students doubles again, so \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
5. **End of April:** The number of students doubles again, so \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
6. **End of May:** The number of students doubles again, so \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

Now, we need to find the additional students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year.

The number of students at the beginning of the year is 10, and by the end of May, there are 320 students. The additional students that joined are:

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. During the week, he made $105. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25} = 420 \]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \]

Therefore, on average, Felix climbed 60 branches per day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picked:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\]

Next, we account for the flowers that are dropped. She drops 1 of each type of flower, so she drops:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\]

"First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores:

- John makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.
- DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.

Total marshmallows used by both = 9 (John) + 9 (DeSean) = 18 marshmallows.

Next, we need to account for the marshmallows that were dropped on the ground:

- Marshmallows dropped = 3.

Now, let's find out how many marshmallows are left in the bag:

- Initial marshmallows in the bag = 35.
- Marshmallows used by John and DeSean = 18.
- Marshmallows dropped = 3.

Marshmallows left in the bag = 35 - 18 - 3 = 14 marshmallows.

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the 14 marshmallows left can be used to make 14 S'mores. These 14 S'mores need to be divided equally between John and DeSean.

S'mores each kid can have = 14 / 2 = 7 S'mores.

Final numerical answer:
7 S'mores each."

"Let's denote the amount of citrus zest used as \( z \) ounces. Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.

The amount of salt used is \( s \) ounces. Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.

The amount of oil used is \( 2s \) ounces because it is twice the amount of salt.

According to the problem, the amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so we have:
\[ s = 2z \]

The total amount of ingredients used is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total amount of ingredients as:
\[ s + s + z + z + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 4s + 2z = 10 \]

Substituting \( s = 2z \) into the equation:
\[ 4(2z) + 2z = 10 \]
\[ 8z + 2z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find \( s \):
\[ s = 2z = 2 \times 1 = 2 \]

The amount of oil used is \( 2s \):
\[ 2s = 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil used is 4 ounces."
"To find out how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows, then add these two amounts together.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John bought 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John bought 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the total amount of money John spent:
- Total cost of goats: $1500
- Total cost of cows: $3000
- Therefore, the total amount of money John spent is \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:
4500"
"Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, which adds up to 8 + 40 = 48 cupcakes.

To find out how many more cupcakes Paul should buy, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number he needs:

63 - 48 = 15

Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"First, let's determine how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. So, the number of cars he gives away is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of cars Joe has after selling and giving some away. The total number of cars he gives away and sells is:

\[ 8 + 16 = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Therefore, the number of cars Joe remains with is:

\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Joe remains with 16 cars after selling and giving some to his mother."
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount raised by the students.
2. Divide this amount by the number of students.

First, we know the total amount raised for the charity is $175,000. Out of this, $50,000 comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to divide this amount by the number of students, which is 20:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\)."
"On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as the first day, which is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) hours.

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is \( 8 + 4 = 12 \) hours.

To convert this total time into minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\( 12 \times 60 = 720 \) minutes.

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars entered, making the total:

50 + 20 = 70 cars

When he got out for lunch, half of the cars left the parking lot. So, the number of cars that left is:

70 / 2 = 35 cars

Therefore, the total number of cars left in the parking lot during lunch break is:

70 - 35 = 35 cars

The total number of cars he counted during lunch break is 35."
"To calculate how much John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tasks John does in a day.
2. Calculate the total number of tasks John does in a week.
3. Calculate the total earnings based on the number of tasks and the pay per task.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of tasks per day.
John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 tasks.
So, the total number of tasks per day is \(30 \times 5 = 150\).

Step 2: Calculate the total number of tasks per week.
Since John works 7 days a week, the total number of tasks per week is \(150 \times 7 = 1050\).

Step 3: Calculate the total earnings.
Each task pays $1.20, so the total earnings for the week are \(1050 \times 1.20 = 1260\).

Therefore, John makes \(\$1260\) in a full 7-day week."
"In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points in the first game.

In the second game, which was at Julie's home court, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her scores from each game: \(14 + 4 = 18\).

Total points Sasha scored during both games: 18."
"To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we need to calculate the total number of tins for each type of food and then find the difference.

First, calculate the total number of tins of cat food:
- Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food.
- Each package contains 11 tins.
- Therefore, the total number of tins of cat food is \(8 \times 11 = 88\).

Next, calculate the total number of tins of dog food:
- Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food.
- Each package contains 6 tins.
- Therefore, the total number of tins of dog food is \(6 \times 6 = 36\).

Now, find the difference between the total number of tins of cat food and dog food:
- The difference is \(88 - 36 = 52\).

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food."
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have:
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.
3. She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs:

- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

Total number of eggs = \(5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27\)

Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the refund she will receive and the cost of shipping the book back. Then, we'll subtract the refund from the original cost of the book to find the net loss.

1. **Calculate the refund amount:**
   - The book's purchase price is $32.
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price.
   - Refund amount = $32 * 0.75 = $24.

2. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds.
   - The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
   - Shipping cost for weight = 4 * $0.35 = $1.40.
   - The book needs to be returned 20 miles away.
   - The shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
   - Shipping cost for distance = 20 * $0.08 = $1.60.
   - Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - Original cost of the book = $32.
   - Refund amount = $24.
   - Net loss = Original cost - Refund amount - Shipping cost = $32 - $24 - $3 = $5.

Milly will lose $5."
"Mulan starts with $40 and her father gives her an additional $100, so she has:

\[ 40 + 100 = 140 \]

She then buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, which costs:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

And she buys a bag for $20. The total amount spent is:

\[ 60 + 20 = 80 \]

Subtracting the total amount spent from the initial amount she had:

\[ 140 - 80 = 60 \]

So, Mulan has $60 left."
"To determine how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the production for the first three weeks and then find out how much is left for the fourth week.

1. **First week production**: 8,000 bars
2. **Second week production**: Half of the first week's production, which is \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars
3. **Third week production**: Three times the first week's production, which is \( 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \) bars

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars} \]

Boris produces a total of 50,000 bars each month. So, the production for the fourth week is the total monthly production minus the production of the first three weeks:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars} \]

Therefore, the production for the fourth week is:
\[ \boxed{14,000} \]"
"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to consider the time she spends on video creation, songwriting, and makeup.

1. **Video Creation:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the time spent on video creation per week is \(18 \times 4 = 72\) minutes.

2. **Songwriting:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, 2 hours = \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.

3. **Makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week on makeup.
   - Therefore, the time spent on makeup per week is \(15 \times 6 = 90\) minutes.

Now, let's sum up the time spent on these activities per week:
\[72 \text{ (video creation)} + 120 \text{ (songwriting)} + 90 \text{ (makeup)} = 282 \text{ minutes per week}\]

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total time spent on TikTok in a month is:

"To calculate the total cost for Angela, we need to break down the charges based on the information provided.

1. **Base Installation Cost**: The base cost for hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures is $129.00.

2. **Additional Items**:
   - Angela needs 6 mirrors, but the base cost already includes 4 mirrors. Therefore, she needs 2 additional mirrors.
   - Angela needs 2 chandeliers, but the base cost already includes 1 chandelier. Therefore, she needs 1 additional chandelier.
   - Angela needs 20 pictures, but the base cost already includes 10 pictures. Therefore, she needs 10 additional pictures.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - Cost for 2 additional mirrors: \(2 \times \$15.00 = \$30.00\)
   - Cost for 1 additional chandelier: \(1 \times \$15.00 = \$15.00\)
   - Cost for 10 additional pictures: \(10 \times \$15.00 = \$150.00\)

4. **Total Additional Cost**: \( \$30.00 + \$15.00 + \$150.00 = \$195.00 \)

5. **Total Cost**: Base installation cost + Total additional cost
   - \( \$129.00 + \$195.00 = \$324.00 \)

**Final Answer**: The total cost for Angela will be $324.00."
"First, let's determine how much money Anthony has saved. Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + \$10.00 = \$20.00 + \$10.00 = \$30.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. According to the problem, Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:

\[ 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times \$30.00 = \$12.00 \]

Therefore, Roy's savings are:

\[ \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = \$30.00 + \$12.00 = \$42.00 \]

So, the amount of money Roy has is:

"To solve this problem, we need to work through the relationships step by step.

1. **Pompei's lifting capacity**: Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.

2. **Saskay's lifting capacity**: Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches high.

3. **Kagiyami's lifting capacity**: Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches high.

4. **Naruto's lifting capacity**: Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches high.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 480 inches to feet by dividing by 12:

\[ \frac{480 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

**Final answer**: 40 feet"
"Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour. 

For the first part of his journey, he travels for 4 hours. The distance covered in this part is:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

After resting, he travels for another 6 hours. The distance covered in this part is:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the distances from both parts of his journey gives the total distance:
\[ 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( v \) (in distance per hour).
   - Since three kangaroos are traveling at the same speed and it takes them 18 hours to cross the highway, the total distance \( D \) of the highway can be calculated as:
     \[
     D = 3v \times 18 \text{ hours}
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     D = 54v
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

3. **Calculate the time it takes for four turtles to cross the highway:**
   - The total distance \( D \) is the same, which is \( 54v \).
   - The speed of four turtles combined is \( 4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v \).
   - The time \( t \) it takes for the four turtles to cross the highway is given by:
     \[
     t = \frac{D}{\text{combined speed}} = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take four turtles 27 hours to cross the highway."
"Given that Kora made 20 dishes, we can use this information to find out how many dishes Rory and Jada made.

1. Kora made 20 dishes.
2. Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made \(20 + 20 = 40\) dishes.
3. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made \(2 \times 40 = 80\) dishes.

To find the total number of dishes they all made together, we add the number of dishes each person made:

\[20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140\]

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is 140."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The cost of the new laptop is $600.
2. If Erika trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, making the new price $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 this week.
4. Her mom agrees to give her $80.
5. Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop.

To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we can set up the equation based on the total amount she needs and the contributions from her job, her mom, and the money in her purse.

Let \( x \) be the amount of money Erika has in her purse. The total amount she has, including the money from her job, her mom, and the money in her purse, should equal the cost of the laptop minus the $50 she still needs.

So, the equation is:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse."
"First, let's calculate the total number of apple slices Adam gets from slicing the apples.

- From 3 large apples, he gets \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices.
- From 5 small apples, he gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.

So, the total number of slices is \(15 + 15 = 30\).

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is \(30 - 15 = 15\).

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is 15."
"The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk a day from one cow. Therefore, with 3 cows, he extracts:

\[ 5 \, \text{liters/cow} \times 3 \, \text{cows} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, he needs:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters a day, the number of additional cows needed is:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day."
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and then sum these lengths.

1. The first glue stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left, so \( \frac{5}{6} \) is not used. Since each glue stick is 12 millimeters long, the unused portion of the first glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left, so \( \frac{1}{3} \) is not used. The unused portion of the second glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left, so \( \frac{1}{2} \) is not used. The unused portion of the third glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Adding these unused portions together gives the total length of the glue sticks that are not used:
\[
10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \text{ millimeters}
\]

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 millimeters."

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Craig has initially. Since he has 2 twenty dollar bills, he starts with:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the six squirt guns. Each squirt gun costs $2, so the total cost for the squirt guns is:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the three packs of water balloons. Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for the water balloons is:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the squirt guns and the water balloons to find the total amount spent:

\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Craig had to find out how much he has left:

\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

- There are 5 students who are good at math only.
- There are 8 students who perform well in English only.
- The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are not good at both subjects:
5 (math only) + 8 (English only) = 13 students

Since there are 20 students in total, the number of students who are good at both subjects is:
20 (total students) - 13 (neither math only nor English only) = 7 students

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math (both math only and both math and English):
5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12 students

Therefore, the number of students good at math is 12.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the simple interest earned over 3 years and then add it to the original investment.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Principal (\(P\)) = $300
- Rate (\(R\)) = three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\% \) or 2.25 in decimal form
- Time (\(T\)) = 3 years

Now, let's calculate the simple interest:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 \]
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 6.75 \]
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 2025 \]

The total amount after 3 years will be the original principal plus the simple interest:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 2025 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 2325 \]

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $2325."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **White Shirts with Collars:**
   - Half of the 40 white shirts have collars.
   - So, \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) white shirts have collars.

2. **White Shirts with No Collars:**
   - Since there are 40 white shirts in total and 20 have collars, the remaining white shirts have no collars.
   - So, \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) white shirts have no collars.

3. **Floral Shirts with Buttons:**
   - 20 of the 50 floral shirts have buttons.

4. **Floral Shirts with No Buttons:**
   - Since there are 50 floral shirts in total and 20 have buttons, the remaining floral shirts have no buttons.
   - So, \( 50 - 20 = 30 \) floral shirts have no buttons.

5. **Difference Between Floral Shirts with No Buttons and White Shirts with No Collars:**
   - We need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars.

"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we first need to determine how many trays he can fill with 900 eggs, given that each tray holds 30 eggs. 

\[ \text{Number of trays} = \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 30 \text{ trays} \times \$2.5/\text{tray} = \$75 \]

Therefore, the farmer will earn \(\$75\)."
"Initially, Mr. Smith has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y.

He sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is:
55 - 10 = 45 goats

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X, which means he sold:
2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y

So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
45 - 20 = 25 goats

Altogether, the number of goats left in the two farms is:
45 (from Farm X) + 25 (from Farm Y) = 70 goats

70 goats"
"James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month. In a year, there are 12 months, so he buys:

\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

He spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find out how much he pays on average for each pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the number of pairs:

\[ \frac{2640}{24} = 110 \]

So, on average, James pays $110 for each pair of shoes."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food.
2. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount applied.
3. Add the two amounts to get the total cost.

Step 1: Cost of 3 baskets of green food
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- Therefore, 3 baskets of green food cost \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

Step 2: Cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount
- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- With a $2 discount for each basket, the cost per basket of red food is \(18 - 2 = 16\) dollars.
- Therefore, 3 baskets of red food cost \(3 \times 16 = 48\) dollars.

Step 3: Total cost
- The total cost is the sum of the cost of the green food and the red food.
- Total cost = \(75 + 48 = 123\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount you will have to pay is $123."
"To find out how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of rooms that constitute one-half of the motel.
2. Determine the total time required to clean these rooms.
3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

Step 1: Calculate one-half of the rooms.
\[ \text{Number of rooms to clean} = \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Step 2: Determine the total time required to clean these rooms.
\[ \text{Time to clean one room} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ \text{Total time to clean 45 rooms} = 45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Step 3: Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

"Let's define the variables for the ages:
- Let \( B \) be the age of your brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of your sister.
- Let \( V \) be your age.

From the information given, we can write the following equations:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( V = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( V = S + 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( \text{Mom's age} = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( V + S + B + (3B - 1) = 87 \).

First, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( V \) from the second equation: \( S = V - 2 \).

Now, substitute \( V \) and \( S \) in terms of \( B \) into the sum equation:
\[ (B - 3) + (B - 5) + B + (3B - 1) = 87 \]
\[ B - 3 + B - 5 + B + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]
\[ 6B = 96 \]
\[ B = 16 \]

Now that we know your brother's age, we can find your age:
\[ V = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

So, you are 13 years old."
"First, we calculate the total number of glue sticks needed. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we multiply 27 by 2:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy. Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ 54 \div 8 = 6.75 \]

"On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles, so the new amount is:
\[ 4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons} \]

On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day is:
\[ 8000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 14000 \text{ gallons} \]

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point on the third day is:

"Rafaela received a $20 tip from each of the forty customers, so the total amount of tips she received is:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \text{ dollars} \]

Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find out how much less, we calculate 10% of $800:

\[ 10\% \times 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Julieta received:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their individual amounts:

"Claire earns 1 badge every month. In a year, which has 12 months, Claire will earn:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so in the same 12 months, Amber will earn:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ badges}}{2} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so in 12 months, Wendy will earn:
\[ 12 \text{ badges} \times 3 = 36 \text{ badges} \]

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1 year time frame, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:
\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame."

"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students.
2. Add the number of burritos Mr. George ate to the total consumed by the students.
3. Subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students.
- There are 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos.
- Total burritos for students = 50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos.

Step 2: Add the number of burritos Mr. George ate.
- Mr. George ate 20 burritos.
- Total burritos consumed = 500 burritos (students) + 20 burritos (Mr. George) = 520 burritos.

Step 3: Subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered.
- Initial number of burritos ordered = 600 burritos.
- Total burritos consumed = 520 burritos.
- Leftover burritos = 600 burritos - 520 burritos = 80 burritos.

The total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 80."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. There are 12 red cars.
2. There are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so there are \(12 - 2 = 10\) green cars.
3. There are 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so there are \(3 \times 10 = 30\) blue cars.

Now, let's calculate the total number of red, green, and blue cars:

\[12 \text{ (red)} + 10 \text{ (green)} + 30 \text{ (blue)} = 52 \text{ cars}\]

The rink has 75 cars in total. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:

So, the number of yellow cars is \(23\)."
"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as \( F \), Anne has as \( A \), and Sofie has as \( S \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \)
2. \( S = A + 25 \)
3. \( A = F - 12 \)

First, we can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation to find \( F \).

From the third equation, we can express \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Substituting \( A \) into the second equation to express \( S \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \]

Now, substituting \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books."

"To determine how much Greg will spend on jello, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.
2. Determine how many boxes of jello are required.
3. Calculate the total cost.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.**

Greg wants each of the 30 kids to have 4 jello cups. So, the total number of jello cups needed is:
\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups per kid} = 120 \text{ cups} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many boxes of jello are required.**

Each box makes 10 small jello cups. To find out how many boxes are needed to make 120 cups, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups per box:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost.**

Each box of jello costs $1.25. Therefore, the total cost for 12 boxes is:

"First, let's calculate how much Madeline pays per month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the $400 monthly cost, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Madeline's monthly payment} = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

This means that Keenan pays the remaining 40% of the monthly cost. We can calculate Keenan's monthly payment as:

\[ \text{Keenan's monthly payment} = 0.40 \times 400 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the question asks for the amount Keenan spends per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide Keenan's monthly payment by 4:

\[ \text{Keenan's weekly payment} = \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Keenan spends $40 per week."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total pieces of pizza**: 60

2. **Pieces eaten on the first day**: \( \frac{2}{5} \) of 60
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24
   \]
   So, Tobias ate 24 pieces on the first day.

3. **Remaining pieces after the first day**: 
   \[
   60 - 24 = 36
   \]

4. **Pieces eaten on the second day**: 10 pieces
   \[
   36 - 10 = 26
   \]
   So, 26 pieces remain after the second day.

5. **Pieces eaten on the third day**: \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining 26 pieces
   \[
   \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14
   \]
   So, Tobias ate 14 pieces on the third day.

"To determine how much Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the profit to find the cost price of the chickens.

First, calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell:
\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \]

Next, calculate the total revenue from selling these chickens:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, so the total cost of the chickens he sold is:

"Julie sold 14 glasses of lemonade. The total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32. Since the boys (Micah and Mitchell) sold an equal number of glasses, we can find out how many glasses Micah sold by first determining how many glasses the boys sold in total.

The total number of glasses sold by Julie and the boys is 32. Subtracting the 14 glasses sold by Julie, we get:
32 - 14 = 18 glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell together.

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses by 2 to find out how many glasses each of them sold:
18 / 2 = 9 glasses sold by Micah.

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold:
14 - 9 = 5.

Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"First, let's calculate the amount Iris spent on the manicure. Since she spent 1/4 as much on a manicure as she did on her hair, we can calculate this as follows:

Manicure cost = 1/4 * Hair cost
Manicure cost = 1/4 * $400
Manicure cost = $100

Next, we calculate the amount spent on the pedicure. She spent 3/4 as much as she did on the manicure:

Pedicure cost = 3/4 * Manicure cost
Pedicure cost = 3/4 * $100
Pedicure cost = $75

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent at the spa:

Total cost = Hair cost + Manicure cost + Pedicure cost
Total cost = $400 + $100 + $75
Total cost = $575

Therefore, Iris spent $575 at the spa."

"To solve this problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age.

If in 10 years Melanie will be 18 years old, we can calculate her current age as follows:
\[ \text{Current age} = 18 - 10 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her current age. Let's denote the number of years from now when this will happen as \( x \).

In \( x \) years, Melanie's age will be \( 8 + x \). According to the problem, at that time, her age will be thrice her current age, which is \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \).

So, we set up the equation:
\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item category:

1. **Bacon**: Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total. So, the cost per pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2.

2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. Therefore, the cost per packet of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4. Since she has 6 packets, the total cost for chicken is $4 * 6 = $24.

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4. With 3 packs, the total cost for strawberries is $4 * 3 = $12.

4. **Apples**: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. With 7 packs, the total cost for apples is $2 * 7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
- Bacon: $10
- Chicken: $24
- Strawberries: $12
- Apples: $14

Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left in her budget, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
$65 - $60 = $5

Therefore, Kelly has $5 left in her budget."
"Let's denote the usual length of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, plus a 15-minute encore, and the total runtime is 65 minutes. We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes.

125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday) = 500 chimichangas.

The final numerical answer is:
500"
"First, we need to determine how many microphones will not find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. Given that 20% of the 50 microphones won't fit, we calculate:

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 microphones

This means 10 microphones will not be paired. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be paired is:

50 - 10 = 40 microphones

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:

40 / 2 = 20 pairs

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.
2. He sees \( \frac{2}{3} \) of that number of birds flying overhead. So, we calculate \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) birds.
3. He also sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, we calculate \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) birds.

Now, we add all these numbers together to find the total number of birds Jerry counts:

\[ 6 + 4 + 24 = 34 \]

So, the total number of birds Jerry counts is 34."
"Lani started with 55 cookies and ate 5, so she had:

\[ 55 - 5 = 50 \]

Now, she placed the remaining 50 cookies equally into 5 jars. To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we divide 50 by 5:

\[ 50 \div 5 = 10 \]

So, there were 10 cookies in each jar."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals for the orchids and the daisies.

For the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the orchids is \(5 \times 5 = 25\).

For the daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the daisies is \(4 \times 10 = 40\).

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of orchid petals from the total number of daisy petals:
- The difference in the number of petals is \(40 - 25 = 15\).

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids."
"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after removing the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants:

\[ \text{Outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. To find the number of flowering plants, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants out of the total 100 plants, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, 25% of the plants are flowering plants."
"Given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can first determine the speed of a thingamabob.

Let the speed of a thingamabob be \( x \) meters per second. Then, the speed of a whatchamacallit is \( 11x \) meters per second. Since the speed of a whatchamacallit is 121 meters per second, we have:
\[ 11x = 121 \]
\[ x = \frac{121}{11} \]
\[ x = 11 \]

So, a thingamabob spins at 11 meters per second.

Next, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a whirligig is:
\[ 5 \times 11 = 55 \]

The speed of a whirligig is 55 meters per second."
"Let's break down the costs:

1. The salad costs $6.
2. The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, so it costs $6 / 2 = $3.
3. The total cost for the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.
4. Ellen pays $11 in total for her goods, so the cost for the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.
5. Ellen eats 2 carrots a day, so the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

Therefore, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day."
"First, let's calculate Mark's new hourly wage after the raise. He used to make $10 an hour and received a raise of $2 per hour, so his new hourly wage is:

\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours he works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is:

\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week:

\[ 12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mark makes \(\boxed{480}\) dollars a week."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Earnings**: Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns.

2. **Earnings from Mowing Lawns**: We need to find out how much Tasha made from mowing lawns. Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( J \).

3. **Mowing Joe's and Kamala's Lawns**:
   - The first week, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. So, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work. Therefore, the total payment for mowing Joe's lawn is \( 6J \).

4. **Mowing Alba's Lawn**:
   - The following week, Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's. So, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.
   - We don't know how much Alba paid, but we can denote the payment as \( 5J \times \text{Alba's rate} \).

5. **Total Earnings from Mowing Lawns**:
   - The total earnings from mowing lawns is the sum of the earnings from Joe's and Alba's lawns. We know the earnings from Joe's lawn are \( 6J \). Let's denote the rate for Alba's lawn as \( R \). So, the earnings from Alba's lawn are \( 5J \times R \).

6. **Total Earnings Equation**:
   - The total earnings from mowing lawns is \( 6J + 5J \times R \).
   - We know the total earnings from mowing lawns is part of the $80 she made. Let's denote the earnings from lemonade sales as \( L \). So, the equation is:
     \[
     6J + 5J \times R + L = 80
     \]

7. **Finding the Rate for Alba's Lawn**:
   - Since we don't have the exact rate for Alba's lawn, we need to find a way to solve for \( J \) and \( R \). However, we can use the information that Joe paid $6 for his lawn, and the total earnings from mowing lawns is part of the $80.

8. **Simplifying the Problem**:
   - We know that the total earnings from mowing lawns is $80 minus the earnings from lemonade sales. Let's assume the rate for Alba's lawn is the same as Joe's, which is $6 per mow. This assumption simplifies the problem.
   - So, the earnings from Alba's lawn would be \( 5J \times 6 = 30J \).

9. **Solving for \( J \)**:
   - The total earnings from mowing lawns is \( 6J + 30J = 36J \).
   - Therefore, the equation becomes:
     \[
     36J + L = 80
     \]

10. **Finding \( J \)**:
    - Since Joe paid $6 for his lawn, and the total earnings from mowing Joe's lawn is \( 6J \), we can assume \( J = 1 \) (since the rate is $6 and the payment is $6, it means she mowed Joe's lawn once).
    - So, \( 36 \times 1 + L = 80 \).

11. **Final Calculation**:
    - \( 36 + L = 80 \)
    - \( L = 80 - 36 \)
    - \( L = 44 \)

Therefore, Tasha made \(\boxed{44}\) dollars from lemonade sales."
"First, let's determine Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, and Martin's weight is 55 kg, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's weight} = \text{Martin's weight} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we calculate Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so:

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = \text{Carl's weight} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we determine Harry's weight. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so:

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = \text{Christian's weight} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"To calculate John's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total hours John rents his car out each month.
2. Calculate his total earnings from renting the car.
3. Subtract his car payment from his total earnings to find his profit.

Step 1: Total hours rented per month
John rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time.
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Step 2: Total earnings
He gets paid $25 an hour.
\[ 30 \times 25 = 750 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 3: Calculate profit
Subtract the car payment from the total earnings.
\[ 750 - 500 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's determine how many notebooks Martha originally had. Since Martha ended up with 7 notebooks after buying 5 more, she originally had:

\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

Now, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. So, Joseph had:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

"Dijana rowed for 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, which means Anis rowed an additional \(50 \times \frac{1}{5} = 10\) miles. Therefore, Anis rowed \(50 + 10 = 60\) miles.

The total distance both of them rowed is \(50 + 60 = 110\) miles.

110 miles"
"Susan originally had 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies for himself, leaving her with \(100 - 4 = 96\) cookies. She wants to divide these 96 cookies equally among her 6 nephews. To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we divide 96 by 6:

\[ \frac{96}{6} = 16 \]

Each of Susan’s nephews will get 16 cookies."
"Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages.

Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.

So, the total number of pages Denise read is \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.

Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and 0 pages today, so he read a total of \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages Daniel read from the total pages Denise read: \(28 - 13 = 15\).

Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the total amount of soup Calvin has in terms of bowls.

Calvin's pot can fill:
- 4 adult bowls
- 8 child bowls

Since Calvin and his wife are both adults, they will each have 1 adult bowl, which totals 2 adult bowls for the adults. This leaves us with 2 adult bowls worth of soup for the children (4 total adult bowls - 2 adult bowls for Calvin and his wife = 2 adult bowls for the children).

Since 8 child bowls are equivalent to 2 adult bowls, we can determine the number of child bowls that 2 adult bowls would be equivalent to by setting up a proportion:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ child bowls}}{4 \text{ adult bowls}} = \frac{x \text{ child bowls}}{2 \text{ adult bowls}} \]

Solving for \(x\):

\[ x = \frac{8 \text{ child bowls} \times 2 \text{ adult bowls}}{4 \text{ adult bowls}} = 4 \text{ child bowls} \]

So, the 2 adult bowls of soup are equivalent to 4 child bowls.

Calvin has 2 children, and there are 4 child bowls of soup. If each child eats one bowl of soup, they will each have 1 bowl. However, since there are 4 child bowls and only 2 children, the leftover soup will be:

\[ 4 \text{ child bowls} - 2 \text{ child bowls} = 2 \text{ child bowls} \]

These 2 child bowls can be divided equally between the 2 children, giving each child an additional:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ child bowls}}{2 \text{ children}} = 1 \text{ child bowl} \]

Therefore, each child will be able to have 1 more bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

Final numerical answer:

"To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, let's calculate the material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 small mask, she needs \(\frac{2}{4} = 0.5\) yards of material.
- For 20 small masks, she would need \(20 \times 0.5 = 10\) yards of material.

Next, let's calculate the material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 large mask, she needs \(\frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75\) yards of material.
- For 8 large masks, she would need \(8 \times 0.75 = 6\) yards of material.

Now, we add the material needed for the small and large masks together:
- Total material needed = material for small masks + material for large masks
- Total material needed = 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards

Therefore, Jo would need \(\boxed{16}\) yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tickets Deepa bought.
2. Divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets to find the average price per ticket.

First, we know that there are 9 Fast and the Furious movies and Deepa has seen each one 3 times. So, the total number of tickets she bought is:
\[ 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times each} = 27 \text{ tickets} \]

Next, we know that she spent $216 in total. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:
\[ \frac{216 \text{ dollars}}{27 \text{ tickets}} = 8 \text{ dollars per ticket} \]

So, the average price she paid per ticket is:

"To determine Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his activities and subtract that from the total hours in a day.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up the time spent on these activities:
\[10 \text{ (sleep)} + 8 \text{ (work)} + 1 \text{ (walk)} = 19 \text{ hours}\]

There are 24 hours in a day. To find the free time, we subtract the total time spent on activities from the total hours in a day:
\[24 - 19 = 5\]

So, Harold has \(\boxed{5}\) hours of free time left in his day."
"Tim starts with 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes.

He uses 3 blue shoe boxes for fishing, so the number of blue shoe boxes left is:
\[ 7 - 3 = 4 \]

He uses \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his red shoe boxes for fishing. Since he has 9 red shoe boxes, the number of red shoe boxes he uses is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \]

So, the number of red shoe boxes left is:
\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \]

Therefore, the total number of shoe boxes left in Tim's box is:
\[ 4 \text{ (blue)} + 6 \text{ (red)} = 10 \]

"To solve this problem, let's first set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( D \) be Duncan's current age and \( A \) be Adam's current age.

From the problem, we know:
- Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).
- Duncan's age eight years ago was \( D - 8 \).
- Adam's age four years ago was \( A - 4 \).
- Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, so we can write the equation: \( D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \).

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam is currently 30 years old. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
2. Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
3. There are 20 red balloons.
4. The total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58.

First, calculate the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons:
\[ 20 \text{ red balloons} \times 2 \text{ pieces per red balloon} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, subtract the number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons from the total number of bologna pieces to find out how many pieces were thrown at the yellow balloons:
\[ 58 \text{ total pieces} - 40 \text{ pieces for red balloons} = 18 \text{ pieces for yellow balloons} \]

Now, since each yellow balloon received 3 pieces of bologna, we can find the number of yellow balloons by dividing the number of bologna pieces for yellow balloons by 3:
\[ \frac{18 \text{ pieces}}{3 \text{ pieces per yellow balloon}} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

Therefore, the number of yellow balloons is:

"To determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs, we first calculate the total miles driven in a 30-day month. Jon drives 100 miles a day, so in 30 days, he drives:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the interval for a tune-up:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time."

There are 12 months in a year, so in 5 years, there are 5 * 12 = 60 months.

Therefore, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected 60 shells.

60 shells"
"Lana has 27 cups in total and divides them into 3 rows. This means each row has:

\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. Therefore, in each row, there are:

\[ \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \text{ cups of chamomile tea and 4.5 cups of mint tea} \]

So, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:

\[ \boxed{4.5} \]"
"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to first understand the time constraints and the number of trips the sloth can make in that time.

1. The sloth takes 4 hours for one round trip (down, pick berries, and back up).
2. In 8 hours, the sloth can make 2 round trips (since \(8 \div 4 = 2\)).

If the sloth makes 2 round trips in 8 hours, and he wants to collect 24 berries in total, we can calculate the number of berries he needs to pick per trip by dividing the total number of berries by the number of trips:

\[ \text{Berries per trip} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground to collect 24 berries in 8 hours is 12 berries per trip.

"First, we need to determine how much water is initially transferred to the tank. The tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water. Therefore, the tank is filled with:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water is used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. Over 6 days, the total amount of water used is:

\[ 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

To find out how much water remains in the tank after 6 days, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank:

\[ 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ 2000 \text{ gallons} \]"
"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the expenses he has already made and the expenses for the current day.

1. **Initial Monthly Budget**: $150
2. **Expenses so far**:
   - **Movies**: 5 (Fridays or Saturdays) + 8 (other days) = 13 movies
     - Cost per movie on Fridays or Saturdays: $10
     - Cost per movie on other days: $7
     - Total cost for 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
     - Total cost for 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
     - Total cost for 13 movies: $50 + $56 = $106
   - **Popcorn**: 2 tubs at $8 each
     - Total cost for popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
   - **Candy**: 4 boxes at $2 each
     - Total cost for candy: 4 * $2 = $8
   - **Total expenses so far**: $106 + $16 + $8 = $130

3. **Remaining Budget**: $150 - $130 = $20

4. **Current Day Expenses**:
   - **Movie**: It's a Friday, so the ticket costs $10.
   - **Popcorn**: $8
   - **Candy**: $2
   - **Total for current day**: $10 + $8 + $2 = $20

5. **Remaining Budget After Current Day Expenses**: $20 - $20 = $0

Since Colby's remaining budget is exactly $0 after accounting for the current day's expenses, he cannot see any more movies.

**Final Answer**: 0"
"First, let's calculate the calorie content for the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. Since a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, each mini cinnamon roll has:
\[ 600 \times \frac{1}{3} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. Since a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, each mini blueberry muffin has:
\[ 450 \times \frac{1}{3} = 150 \text{ calories} \]

Now, let's calculate the total calories for all the mini pastries Andrew baked.

For the mini cinnamon rolls:
\[ 200 \text{ rolls} \times 200 \text{ calories/roll} = 40,000 \text{ calories} \]

For the mini blueberry muffins:
\[ 300 \text{ muffins} \times 150 \text{ calories/muffin} = 45,000 \text{ calories} \]

Adding these together gives the total calories for all the pastries:
\[ 40,000 \text{ calories} + 45,000 \text{ calories} = 85,000 \text{ calories} \]

Therefore, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is:
\[ 85,000 \text{ calories} \]"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the week and then divide by the number of days.

1. On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
2. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, so for each day:
   \( 2 \times 39 = 78 \) Junebugs.
3. On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
4. On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's sum up the total number of Junebugs removed:

\[ 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 \]

Adding these together:

\[ 39 + 78 = 117 \]
\[ 117 + 78 = 195 \]
\[ 195 + 48 = 243 \]
\[ 243 + 57 = 300 \]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{300}{5} = 60 \]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

For the bus:
- Speed = 60 miles per hour
- Time = 5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

For the car:
- Speed = 30 miles per hour
- Time = 8 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, to find out how much farther the bus went than the car:
- Difference in distance = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of all the other toys and then subtract that total from the overall number of toys Sophie has.

1. The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
2. The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
3. The tower of stacking rings has 9 rings.
4. The total number of toys is 62.

First, we add up the number of building blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Next, we subtract this sum from the total number of toys to find out how many bouncy balls there are:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

So, the tube of bouncy balls contains 14 bouncy balls."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( P + Pa + J = 100 \)
2. \( Pa = J + 10 \)
3. \( P = Pa + J \)

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we have \( J \), we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is \( 50 \) years.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Maria invited 4 friends, so there are 4 + 1 (Maria) = 5 people in total.
2. Maria gave each of her friends 2 water balloons, so that's 4 friends * 2 balloons = 8 balloons.
3. Maria had 1 water balloon for herself.
4. Then, her mom gave each person 3 more balloons, so that's 5 people * 3 balloons = 15 balloons.

Now, let's add up all the balloons:
- Initial balloons given by Maria: 8 + 1 (for herself) = 9 balloons.
- Additional balloons given by her mom: 15 balloons.

Total balloons = 9 + 15 = 24 balloons.

The girls had a total of 24 balloons."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated and already owned by the charity group.

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so the total number of donated boxes is:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

Adding the 10 boxes they already have:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Each table can fit 2 boxes, so the total number of tables needed to fit all the boxes is:
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

Since they already own 15 tables, the number of new tables they need is:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ tables} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"

- Total distance spat by both: \(400 + 420 = 820\) feet
- Number of people: 2
- Average total distance spat: \(\frac{820}{2} = 410\) feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine over a month, then find the revenue from selling those widgets, and finally, find the difference in revenue.

1. **Calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine:**

   - **Widgeteer 3000:**
     - Widgets per hour: 60
     - Hours per day: 24
     - Days in a month: 30
     - Total widgets = 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets

   - **WidgetMaster 9000:**
     - Widgets per hour: 45
     - Hours per day: 24
     - Days in a month: 30
     - Total widgets = 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

2. **Calculate the revenue from selling the widgets:**

   - **Revenue from Widgeteer 3000:**
     - Price per widget: $6
     - Total revenue = 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

   - **Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000:**
     - Price per widget: $6
     - Total revenue = 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

3. **Calculate the difference in revenue:**

   - Difference in revenue = Revenue from Widgeteer 3000 - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000
   - Difference in revenue = $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

**Final Answer:**
Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay under both options and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron pays for a 24-hour stay:
\[ \text{Cost for 24-hour stay} = 1600 \text{ pesos} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron pays for the first 12 hours and then adds 70 pesos for each additional hour:
- Cameron stays from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.
- The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos.
- The additional hours are \(17 - 12 = 5\) hours.
- The cost for the additional hours is \(5 \times 70 = 350\) pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for this option is \(1000 + 350 = 1350\) pesos.

Now, we find the difference between the two options to determine the savings:
\[ \text{Savings} = 1600 - 1350 = 250 \text{ pesos} \]

Cameron would save \(\boxed{250}\) pesos."
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, twice that amount is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pounds. Therefore, each sheep needs \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds of hay.

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. With 15 goats, the total hay needed for the goats is \(15 \times 5 = 75\) pounds.

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. With 12 sheep, the total hay needed for the sheep is \(12 \times 7 = 84\) pounds.

Finally, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs: \(75 + 84 = 159\) pounds.

Therefore, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay."
"First, let's calculate how much John earned in the week. He earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:

\[ 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we need to account for his expenses. He spends $50 on gas, so his remaining money is:

\[ 300 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 250 \, \text{dollars} \]

John also wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so after the deposit, he will have:

\[ 250 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, he buys 5 pencils that cost $10 each, so the total cost for the pencils is:

\[ 5 \, \text{pencils} \times 10 \, \text{dollars/pencil} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from his remaining money, he has:

\[ 150 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many $25 pens he can buy with the remaining $100. The number of pens he can buy is:

\[ \frac{100 \, \text{dollars}}{25 \, \text{dollars/pen}} = 4 \, \text{pens} \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled out. Craig has spelled out 20 words, each with 15 letters. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig has spelled is:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled is:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the number of letters Craig has spelled to the number of letters his brother has spelled:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

\[ 650 \]"
"To find the total number of children in the drill, we need to calculate the number of children per row and then multiply by the total number of rows.

Each row has 8 children, and there are 7 rows per school. Since there are 5 different schools, the total number of rows is \(7 \times 5 = 35\).

Now, we multiply the number of children per row by the total number of rows:

\[8 \text{ children/row} \times 35 \text{ rows} = 280 \text{ children}\]

So, the total number of children in the drill is 280."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming all her coupons. Since each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice, and she has 9 coupons, the total number of bottles is:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself."
"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing job, we need to consider the following components:

1. The visit charge: $40
2. The labor charge: $35 per hour for 2.25 hours. Since the charge is per hour or part thereof, we round up 2.25 hours to 3 hours (as partial hours are charged as full hours). So, the labor charge is $35 * 3 = $105.
3. The parts charge: $60

Now, we add these components together:

Total charge = Visit charge + Labor charge + Parts charge
Total charge = $40 + $105 + $60
Total charge = $205

Therefore, Patty charged $205 for the job."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount:

\[ 10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.40 \times \$150 = \$60 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:

\[ \$150 - \$60 = \$90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each:

\[ 5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40 \text{ per CD} = \$200 \]

Now, we need to determine how much money James was out after selling 5 of the CDs. The amount he was out initially was $90, and he received $200 from selling 5 CDs. Therefore, the net amount he was out is:

\[ \$90 - \$200 = -\$110 \]

Since the question asks how much money he was out, and the negative value indicates he gained money, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$110 \]

James was out \$110 less, or he gained \$110."
"To calculate how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to multiply the quantity of each type of root crop by its respective price and then sum up the totals.

1. For yams: \(6 \text{ yams} \times \$1.5 \text{ per yam} = \$9\)
2. For sweet potatoes: \(10 \text{ sweet potatoes} \times \$2 \text{ per sweet potato} = \$20\)
3. For carrots: \(4 \text{ carrots} \times \$1.25 \text{ per carrot} = \$5\)

Now, we add up the totals from each type of root crop:

\(\$9 + \$20 + \$5 = \$34\)

Therefore, if Jen sells everything, she will earn \(\$34\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - \( 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \) miles.

2. **Calculate the time it takes to swim the initial distance:**
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time to swim 12 miles: \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \) hours.

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   - James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   - Rest time: \( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   - Total distance: 20 miles.
   - Distance already swum: 12 miles.
   - Remaining distance: \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the new swimming speed:**
   - James swims at half the initial speed.
   - New speed: \( \frac{2 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile/hour} \).

6. **Calculate the time to swim the remaining distance:**
   - Time to swim 8 miles at 1 mile per hour: \( \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \) hours.

7. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Time to swim the initial distance: 6 hours.
   - Rest time: 3 hours.
   - Time to swim the remaining distance: 8 hours.
   - Total time: \( 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 \) hours.

"To calculate the total commission Cayley earns, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the commission from the New York Times.
2. Calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal.
3. Add the two amounts to get the total commission.

**Step 1: Commission from the New York Times**
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy of the New York Times.
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- He sells 6 copies.

The commission per copy of the New York Times is:
\[ 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \]

The total commission from 6 copies is:

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \) (total points scored by the team)
2. \( B = A + 20 \) (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)
3. \( B = D + 10 \) (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \)
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \)

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) in the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 25 \) back into the equation for \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \( 5 \) points.

Final answer:
Azibo scored 5 points."
"To determine the number of pages in the book, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of pages per inch**: Since the paper is 100 pages to the inch, and each sheet of paper is printed on both sides, this means that each inch of thickness corresponds to 200 pages (100 pages per side).

2. **Calculate the total number of pages**: Given that the book is 1.5 inches thick, we multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book in inches.

\[ \text{Total pages} = 200 \, \text{pages/inch} \times 1.5 \, \text{inches} \]

\[ \text{Total pages} = 300 \, \text{pages} \]

Therefore, the book has 300 pages."
"First, let's calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we convert the total time into minutes:
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals there are in 900 minutes, we divide:
900 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:
60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - The total sleep duration is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours.
   - Converting 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Time Waking Up Earlier:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so her usual wake-up time of 6 a.m. is now 5:55 a.m.

3. **Sleepwalking Duration:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is \(2:38 - 2:15 = 23\) minutes.

4. **Time Kim Was Awake Before Sleepwalking:**
   - From 2:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m., Kim was awake.
   - The duration of being awake before sleepwalking is \(5:55 - 2:15 = 3\) hours and 40 minutes.
   - Converting 3 hours and 40 minutes to minutes: \(3 \times 60 + 40 = 220\) minutes.

5. **Total Time Kim Was Awake:**
   - Total time awake is the sum of the time before sleepwalking and the sleepwalking duration.
   - Total time awake = \(220 + 23 = 243\) minutes.

6. **Total Time Kim Was Asleep:**
   - Usual sleep duration = 480 minutes.
   - Subtract the time she was awake: \(480 - 243 = 237\) minutes.

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for \(\boxed{237}\) minutes that day."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring cups Jonathan has. Since he has two dozen cups, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Next, we know that Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, we add the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has:

\[ 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \text{ utensils} \]

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ 34 \]"
"Initially, the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds with 1/5 occupied. This means:

\[ \text{Occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

So, the number of unoccupied beds initially is:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

Over the course of 2 weeks (14 days), 50 patients are admitted each day. Therefore, the total number of new admissions in 2 weeks is:

\[ \text{Total new admissions} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

After 2 weeks, the total number of occupied beds will be the initial occupied beds plus the new admissions:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

**100**"
"Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the remainder is:

16 - 7 = 9 emails.

Two-thirds of these 9 emails are to family. So, the number of emails to family is:

(2/3) * 9 = 6 emails.

The remaining emails, which are not to family, are:

9 - 6 = 3 emails.

One-third of these remaining emails are to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails to her boyfriend is:

(1/3) * 3 = 1 email.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

1 email/day"
"If Aliya is 3 years old, and Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya, then Shawna is:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, Shawna's father is:

\[ 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"If Courtney overstated the number of people by 20%, we can represent the actual number of people as 100% and the number Courtney reported as 120% of the actual number. Let's denote the actual number of people as \( x \).

According to Kelly, Courtney reported 48 people, which is 120% of the actual number. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]

\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"To solve this problem, let's define the number of balls each boy carried in terms of Jeffrey's number of balls.

Let \( J \) represent the number of balls Jeffrey carried. According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by all three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each boy:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

Now, we can find the total number of balls:
\[ 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes by the end of the third day after filling in two holes.
3. Use the information that the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

Let's start with the first step:

- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes.

So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29 \]

By the end of the third day, they had 29 holes. According to the problem, by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes was four times the number of holes at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day was 10. Therefore, by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes was:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Since they had 29 holes at the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \]

So, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Let's denote the number of corn chips that Collins received as \( C \).

Since Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, the total number of corn chips they received together is:
\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]

Collins received 15 more corn chips than each of Amora and Lainey, so:
\[ C = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ 140 + 85 = 225 \]

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ 225 \]"
"To find out how much the travel costs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, which is 50% more than the supplies.

The cost of supplies is $400. 

50% of $400 is calculated as:
\[ 400 \times \frac{50}{100} = 400 \times 0.5 = 200 \]

So, the total cost of the tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the travel costs:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( X + S + A = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, we can substitute the expression for \( X \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (S + 5) + S + A = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A = 334 \]

Next, we substitute the expression for \( S \) from the third equation into the equation above:
\[ 2(4A - 13) + A = 334 \]
\[ 8A - 26 + A = 334 \]
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we have \( A \), we can find \( S \):
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught \(\boxed{147}\) Pokemon."
"Each episode is 20 minutes long. There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, so there are \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) episodes in total.

To find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

\( 10 \text{ episodes} \times 20 \text{ minutes/episode} = 200 \text{ minutes} \)

John will spend 200 minutes watching the show."
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird flew in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction.

1. The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 10 \, \text{hours} \times 30 \, \text{miles/hour} = 300 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. The bird then flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 2 \, \text{hours} \times 18 \, \text{miles/hour} = 36 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 5 \, \text{hours} \times 22 \, \text{miles/hour} = 110 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Now, we sum the distances flown in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction:
\[
\text{Total distance south} = 300 \, \text{miles} + 110 \, \text{miles} = 410 \, \text{miles}
\]
\[
\text{Total distance north} = 36 \, \text{miles}
\]
\[
\text{Net distance south} = 410 \, \text{miles} - 36 \, \text{miles} = 374 \, \text{miles}
\]

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[
\boxed{374 \, \text{miles}}
\]"
"To find out how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Greta initially made 1 dozen (12) cream cheese swirl brownies.
2. At her office party, she received an additional 1/2 dozen (6) brownies.
3. When she arrived home, she had 4 dozen (48) brownies from her friends.
4. During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten.

Now, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had before the surprise party:
\[ 12 \text{ (initial batch)} + 6 \text{ (from office party)} + 48 \text{ (from friends)} = 66 \text{ brownies} \]

Next, we subtract the number of brownies eaten during the surprise party:
\[ 66 \text{ (total brownies)} - 18 \text{ (eaten)} = 48 \text{ brownies} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 48 \text{ brownies} \]"
"Nani is 8 years old.

His brother is twice Nani's age, so the brother is \(8 \times 2 = 16\) years old.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find 25% of Nani's age, we calculate \(8 \times 0.25 = 2\). So, the sister is \(8 - 2 = 6\) years old.

The total age of all three family members is \(8 + 16 + 6 = 30\).

Therefore, the total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister is 30 years."
"To determine the total time it will take Andy to restring all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of stringing and then sum these times.

Therefore, it will take Andy a total of 227 minutes to restring all the racquets."
"John is buying phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which totals 4 phones.

The first 2 phones are at full price, so:
- The cost for the first 2 phones is \(2 \times \$600 = \$1200\).

The remaining 2 phones are at half price, so:
- The cost for each of these phones is \(\$600 / 2 = \$300\).
- The cost for the last 2 phones is \(2 \times \$300 = \$600\).

Adding the costs together:
- Total cost = \$1200 (for the first 2 phones) + \$600 (for the last 2 phones) = \$1800.

Therefore, John paid a total of \$1800 for all the phones."
"To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. 

Given that Carlton's team has 13 players and Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = \text{Number of players on Carlton's team} + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 13 + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 20 \]

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

\[ \text{Total number of players} = \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} + \text{Number of players on Carlton's team} \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 20 + 13 \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is 33."
"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of slats} = 100 \]

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially bought and then subtract the boxes she gave away.

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes given away.

So, the number of boxes left after giving away is:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

Next, she kept 1/4 of the remaining 8 boxes for herself. The number of boxes she kept is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of boxes she sold is the remaining boxes after keeping 2 for herself:
\[ 8 - 2 = 6 \]

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \]

So, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges."
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, the number of states in India can be expressed as \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India, which is \( x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \).

Simplifying the expression, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \).

Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is 79."

1. **Determine the number of boxes sold on each day:**

   - **Saturday:**
     - Gingerbread: 10 boxes
     - Apple pie: 4 fewer boxes than on Sunday, so we need to find out how many boxes were sold on Sunday first.

   - **Sunday:**
     - Gingerbread: 5 more boxes than on Saturday, so \(10 + 5 = 15\) boxes
     - Apple pie: 15 boxes

   - Now, we can find out how many boxes of apple pie were sold on Saturday:
     - Apple pie on Saturday: \(15 - 4 = 11\) boxes

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.
2. Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, which means her sister gave her \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.
3. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which means her friend gave her \(20 \times 2 = 40\) beads.

Now, let's add up all the beads:

- Beads from mother: 20
- Beads from sister: 30
- Beads from friend: 40

Total beads = 20 + 30 + 40 = 90

Adrianne had 90 beads altogether."
"On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount of Thursday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) pounds.

The total amount of crawfish caught over the three days is \(3 + 12 + 6 = 21\) pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, the number of servings Joe has is \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) servings.

Therefore, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish."
"First, let's calculate the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \times 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 football players.

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after accounting for the football players:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We calculate this as follows:

\[ 25\% \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

Now, we add the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members to find the total number of students leaving early:

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is:

12"
"If Sophie wears size 5 boots, then Charlie's boots are five times that size, which would be:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

To find the average size of the shoes worn by the two, we add the sizes together and divide by 2:

\[ \frac{5 + 25}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

The average size of shoe worn by the two is 15."
"To determine how many additional flowers Pat needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them. Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Therefore, the total space required for each plant is:

\[1 \text{ foot (plant)} + 1.5 \text{ feet (space)} = 2.5 \text{ feet}\]

Next, we need to find out how many plants can fit in the 111 feet long flower bed. We do this by dividing the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each plant:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means Pat can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional flowers she needs to buy is:

\[44 - 17 = 27\]

Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:

\[27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, Pat will spend \(\boxed{162}\) dollars at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, so we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9 \text{ pretzels per day} \]

- Each basket needs 3 petunias.
- There are 5 baskets.
- Each petunia costs $3.00.

The total number of petunias needed is:
\[ 3 \text{ petunias/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 15 \text{ petunias} \]

The total cost for the petunias is:
\[ 15 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00/\text{petunia} = \$45.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the sweet potato vines:
- Each basket needs 2 sweet potato vines.
- There are 5 baskets.
- Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.

The total number of sweet potato vines needed is:
\[ 2 \text{ vines/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 10 \text{ vines} \]

The total cost for the sweet potato vines is:
\[ 10 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50/\text{vine} = \$25.00 \]

Now, we sum the costs for the petunias and the sweet potato vines to find the total cost:
\[ \$45.00 + \$25.00 = \$70.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers, so the total soil used for sunflowers is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations, so the total soil used for carnations is \(10 \times 1.5 = 15\) pounds.

Adding these together, the total soil used for sunflowers and carnations is \(12 + 15 = 27\) pounds.

The total bag of soil is 30 pounds, so the remaining soil for roses is \(30 - 27 = 3\) pounds.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is \(3 \div 1 = 3\).

Therefore, they can plant 3 roses."
"First, let's calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times \$2,000.00 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with the $500.00 she sets aside each month. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

\[ \text{Number of shoes per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \]

Since she can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0.5 pairs per month, which means she can buy 1 pair every 2 months.

Now, let's calculate how many pairs she can buy in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

\[ \text{Number of pairs per year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months per pair}} = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time it takes for Emily to both peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp:
- Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
- To peel 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{6} = 15 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to sauté 90 shrimp:
- Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- To sauté 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{30} \times 10 = 3 \times 10 = 30 \) minutes.

Since peeling and sautéing are sequential tasks, we add the time for each task:
- Total time = Time to peel + Time to sauté = 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

45 minutes"
"Let's break down the cooling and warming process step by step:

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - Cooling rate: 2 degrees per hour
   - Total cooling: \(2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 6 \, \text{degrees}\)

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - Cooling rate: 3 degrees per hour
   - Total cooling: \(3 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 12 \, \text{degrees}\)

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - Warming rate: 2 degrees per hour
   - Total warming: \(2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{degrees}\)

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:
- Total cooling: \(6 \, \text{degrees} + 12 \, \text{degrees} = 18 \, \text{degrees}\)
- Total warming: \(4 \, \text{degrees}\)

Net change in temperature:
- Net cooling: \(18 \, \text{degrees} - 4 \, \text{degrees} = 14 \, \text{degrees}\)

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

**Final answer:**
14 degrees"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

3. **Determine the time between the first and second sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, so the time between the first and second sightings is 75 years.

4. **Calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and the time between the first and second sightings is 75 years, then Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each type of payment and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill**: He writes one check per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes \(12 \times 1 = 12\) checks for the electric bill per year.

2. **Gas bill**: Similarly, he writes one check per month for the gas bill, which also totals \(12 \times 1 = 12\) checks per year.

3. **Church**: He writes two checks per month for the church. Over a year, this amounts to \(12 \times 2 = 24\) checks.

4. **Pest and lawn service**: He writes one check every quarter. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, he writes \(4 \times 1 = 4\) checks for the pest and lawn service per year.

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52\]

Therefore, Buford writes a total of 52 checks per year."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips each day. These trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes, so the first plane makes \(44 \times 2 = 88\) trips each day.

2. Out of these 88 trips, three-quarters of the flights are to Greece. So, the number of flights to Greece is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66\).

3. The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The remaining flights are \(88 - 66 = 22\). Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is \(\frac{22}{2} = 11\).

Therefore, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we can start by calculating the duration of each wolf's howl.

1. Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds.
3. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Now, we add the durations of all three howls together:
\[20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds}\]

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[120 \div 60 = 2 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and then subtract that from the total cost of the trousers.

1. Adam's mother gave him $6.
2. Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.
3. The total amount of money given by his parents is \(6 + 12 = 18\) dollars.
4. The trousers cost $30.

Now, we subtract the total amount given by his parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings.

\(30 - 18 = 12\)

Adam had to contribute \(\boxed{12}\) dollars from his savings."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(Al\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
- \(A = 3\)
- \(Al = 4\)
- The total age of the children is 20, so \(A + Al + H + W = 20\).
- Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, so \(H = 2 \times \frac{A + Al + H + W}{4}\).

First, substitute the known values into the total age equation:
\[3 + 4 + H + W = 20\]
\[7 + H + W = 20\]
\[H + W = 13\]

Next, substitute the known values into the equation for Helene's age:
\[H = 2 \times \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times \frac{7 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = \frac{2(7 + H + W)}{4}\]
\[H = \frac{14 + 2H + 2W}{4}\]
\[4H = 14 + 2H + 2W\]
\[2H = 14 + 2W\]
\[H = 7 + W\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(H + W = 13\)
2. \(H = 7 + W\)

Substitute the second equation into the first:
\[7 + W + W = 13\]
\[7 + 2W = 13\]
\[2W = 6\]
\[W = 3\]

So, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the total amount of money collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund. This is $500 from the neighbors plus $1500 from the online fund, which totals $2000.

Walter's friend then contributes $200. Adding this to the previous total, we get $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Walter's lawyer is going to donate three times the total amount collected from everyone else. Since the total collected from everyone else is $2200, the lawyer's contribution will be 3 * $2200 = $6600.

Therefore, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception. With 100 guests and each bringing a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

The bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

If each person in the church next door received 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is:

50"
"Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is \( 2 + 4 = 6 \) slices. The total size of the watermelon can be represented as the sum of the sizes of all the slices, which is \( 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \).

The size of each adult's slice is \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of each adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his activities and subtract this from the nine hours he has available.

1. **Time spent on inpatient rounds:**
   - He has 9 inpatients.
   - Each round takes 20 minutes.
   - Total time for rounds = 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes.

2. **Time spent on appointments:**
   - He has 10 appointments.
   - Each appointment takes 30 minutes.
   - Total time for appointments = 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes.

3. **Total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments:**
   - Total time = 180 minutes (rounds) + 300 minutes (appointments) = 480 minutes.

4. **Convert total time spent to hours:**
   - 480 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 8 hours.

5. **Time left to update records:**
   - Total available time = 9 hours.
   - Time spent = 8 hours.
   - Time left = 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

**Final answer:**

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to work backwards from the 5:00 pm serving time, accounting for all the steps required to make the cake.

1. Frosting the cake takes 10 minutes.
2. Cooling the cake takes 2 hours (120 minutes).
3. Baking the cake takes 30 minutes.
4. Making the cake batter takes 20 minutes.

Adding these times together:
\[ 10 \text{ minutes (frosting)} + 120 \text{ minutes (cooling)} + 30 \text{ minutes (baking)} + 20 \text{ minutes (making batter)} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours. Therefore, Jordan needs to start 3 hours before 5:00 pm.

\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

So, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter.
2. Use the total number of chocolate bars sold to find the number of bars per box.

First, let's add the number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter:
- Lisa sold 3.5 boxes.
- Peter sold 4.5 boxes.

Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

They sold 64 chocolate bars together. To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:

Number of chocolate bars per box = Total chocolate bars / Total boxes
Number of chocolate bars per box = 64 / 8
Number of chocolate bars per box = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per session for the studio.
2. Calculate the total cost per day for the studio.
3. Calculate the total cost per week for the studio.
4. Calculate the total cost per month for the studio.

First, let's calculate the cost per session for the studio:
- The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
- The cost per student per session is $1.50.
- With 10 students, the cost per session for students is \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost per session for the studio is \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost per day for the studio:
- The studio is rented 3 days a week.
- So, the total cost per day is \(40 \times 3 = 120\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost per week for the studio:
- Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the total cost per week is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) dollars.

Finally, we calculate the total cost per month for the studio:
- The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is \(480 \times 4 = 1920\) dollars.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $1920."
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \(P\) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \(M\).

Given that Peter has 4 boxes and a total of 64 chocolate bars, we can write the equation:
\[4P = 64\]

Solving for \(P\):
\[P = \frac{64}{4} = 16\]

Given that Martha has 7 boxes and a total of 56 chocolate bars, we can write the equation:
\[7M = 56\]

Solving for \(M\):
\[M = \frac{56}{7} = 8\]

Now, to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract \(M\) from \(P\):
\[P - M = 16 - 8 = 8\]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
"First, let's determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the total number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Babies born per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. Adding the number of babies born in a year to the initial population gives us the total number of porcupines after a year:

\[ \text{Total porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

Therefore, the number of porcupines in the park after a year is:

1490"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, so we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

So, the volume of the pool is:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"To find the total number of sticks, let's break down the information given:

1. There are 9 red sticks.
2. There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so the number of blue sticks is \(9 + 5 = 14\).
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is \(14 - 3 = 11\).

Now, to find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

\[9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34\]

Therefore, the total number of sticks they have is 34."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

For Matteo:
- Speed = 55 miles per hour
- Time = 4 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

For Shandy:
- Speed = 45 miles per hour
- Time = 10 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo:
- Difference in distance = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Total students: 3000
- Half of the students are over 16 years old: \( \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \)
- One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male: \( \frac{1500}{4} = 375 \)
- Therefore, the number of female students over 16 years old is: \( 1500 - 375 = 1125 \)

- The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old: \( \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \)
- One-half of the students under 16 are male: \( \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \)
- Therefore, the number of female students under 16 years old is: \( 1500 - 750 = 750 \)

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 to the number of female students under 16:

- Total female students: \( 1125 + 750 = 1875 \)

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run in one hour:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

\(10 - 5 = 5\)

Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
   - Tank's capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Water filled by Wanda on the first day = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
   - Water filled by Ms. B on the first day = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the first day = \( 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \) gallons.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water pumped by Wanda on the second day = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the second day = \( 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \) gallons.

3. **Total Water Filled:**
   - Total water filled in two days = \( 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \) gallons.

4. **Water Remaining:**

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final charge percentage to the initial charge percentage when Maria left for the park.

Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( C \).

1. **First 5 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour.
   - After 5 hours, the charge remaining is \( C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).

2. **Next 3 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour.
   - After these 3 hours, the charge remaining is \( C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = 0.28 \]

First, calculate the factors:
\[ (1 - 0.09) = 0.91 \]
\[ (1 - 0.07) = 0.93 \]

Now, raise these to their respective powers:
\[ 0.91^5 \approx 0.624 \]
\[ 0.93^3 \approx 0.804 \]

Multiply these together:
\[ 0.624 \times 0.804 \approx 0.501 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ C \times 0.501 = 0.28 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.501} \approx 0.559 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 55.9%."
"First, let's calculate Janet's total earnings per hour from both wages and tips:

\[ \text{Hourly earnings} = \$10 + \$15 = \$25 \]

Next, we need to determine how much she wants to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of $10,000:

\[ \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times \$10,000 = \$2,000 \]

Now, we calculate how much she earns in a week by working 40 hours:

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 40 \text{ hours} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$1,000 \]

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\$2,000}{\$1,000/\text{week}} = 2 \]

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jamaar has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total spent so far:

\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount he has is:

\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

Each plum costs $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of one plum:

\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums."
"First, let's calculate the total number of sweets Anne has:

Total packs = 15
Sweets per pack = 60

Total sweets = 15 packs * 60 sweets/pack = 900 sweets

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is:

Packs given to friends = Total packs - Packs kept
Packs given to friends = 15 - 2 = 13 packs

Now, we need to find out how many sweets are in these 13 packs:

Sweets given to friends = 13 packs * 60 sweets/pack = 780 sweets

Since these sweets are to be divided equally among her 10 friends:

Sweets per friend = Sweets given to friends / Number of friends
Sweets per friend = 780 sweets / 10 friends = 78 sweets

Each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."

After the first year, the price will be:
\[ 120 + 0.05 \times 120 = 120 \times 1.05 = 126 \]

After the second year, the price will be:
\[ 126 + 0.05 \times 126 = 126 \times 1.05 = 132.30 \]

After the third year, the price will be:
\[ 132.30 + 0.05 \times 132.30 = 132.30 \times 1.05 = 139.465 \]

Rounding $139.465 to the nearest integer, we get $139.

Therefore, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"First, we need to determine how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she evenly distributed 72 pictures into 8 albums, we divide 72 by 8:

\[ 72 \div 8 = 9 \]

So, each album contains 9 pictures.

Next, we know that 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits only. This means there are:

- 3 albums of selfies, so \(3 \times 9 = 27\) selfies.
- 2 albums of portraits, so \(2 \times 9 = 18\) portraits.

Therefore, the total number of portraits and selfies is:

\[ 27 + 18 = 45 \]

Final numerical answer:
45"
"To find out how long James spends reading, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how long it takes James to read one page.
2. Calculate the total time spent reading 18 pages.

First, we know that James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. Therefore, the time it takes to read one page is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes to read 18 pages. We multiply the time it takes to read one page by 18:
\[ 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.
2. 24 guests elected for an early checkout, so the number of guests decreased by 24.
3. 15 guests elected for a late checkout, so the number of guests decreased by 15.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice that number is 30 guests who checked in.
5. After dinner, 7 more people checked in.

Now, let's calculate the number of guests step by step:

- Initial number of guests: 100
- Guests after early checkouts: 100 - 24 = 76
- Guests after late checkouts: 76 - 15 = 61
- Guests after afternoon check-ins: 61 + 30 = 91
- Guests after dinner check-ins: 91 + 7 = 98

So, the final number of guests in the hotel is 98."
"John picks 4 bananas on Wednesday.
He picks 6 bananas on Thursday.
On Friday, he picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

To find the total number of bananas John has, we add the bananas picked each day:
4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas.

John has 22 bananas."
"First, let's break down the quiz into its components:

- Total number of questions: 60
- Percentage of easy questions: 40%
- Number of easy questions: \(60 \times 0.40 = 24\)
- Number of average and difficult questions: \(60 - 24 = 36\)
- Since the remaining questions are equally divided between average and difficult, the number of average questions is \(36 / 2 = 18\) and the number of difficult questions is also \(18\).

Next, we calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:

- Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct: \(24 \times 0.75 = 18\)
- Aries is sure to get half of the average questions correct: \(18 / 2 = 9\)
- Aries is sure to get half of the difficult questions correct: \(18 / 2 = 9\)

Adding these up gives the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:

\[18 + 9 + 9 = 36\]

Therefore, Aries is sure to get 36 points."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the price of a small stuffed animal be \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal be \( L \).
2. According to the problem, \( L = 3S \).
3. Given that each small stuffed animal costs $4, we have \( S = 4 \).
4. Therefore, the price of a large stuffed animal \( L = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let the number of large stuffed animals sold be \( x \). Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \) because she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.

The total earnings from the sales are given as $120. So, we can write the equation for total earnings as:
\[ 12x + 4(2x) = 120 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 12x + 8x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals. Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals."
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first calculate the daily consumption and then multiply by 7 (the number of days in a week).

- The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
- The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
- The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

So, the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the family is:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Now, to find the total for one week (7 days):
\[ 11 \times 7 = 77 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Therefore, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"First, let's calculate the total earnings from the cookies and cupcakes.

From the cookies:
80 cookies * $1/cookie = $80

From the cupcakes:
60 cupcakes * $4/cupcake = $240

Total earnings from cookies and cupcakes:
$80 + $240 = $320

Next, we subtract the amount given to her sisters:
$320 - ($10 * 2) = $320 - $20 = $300

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings."
"The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found:

\[30 + 30 = 60\]

The total number of eggs hidden was 100, and 10 eggs were not found by anyone. Therefore, the number of eggs found by the friends is:

\[100 - 60 - 10 = 30\]

So, the friends found 30 eggs."
"First, let's determine the amount of ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day. We know that a dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is:

\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ pounds per day} \]

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. So, the amount of ore mined per day with a steel pickaxe is:

\[ 24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days, each using a steel pickaxe. The total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves in one day is:

\[ 40 \times 36 = 1440 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Over 30 days, the total amount of ore mined is:

\[ 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{43200} \]"
"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich for each package and then use that to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

1. For the first package:
   - 2 sandwiches for $3
   - Price per sandwich = $3 / 2 = $1.50

2. For the second package:
   - 4 sandwiches for $6
   - Price per sandwich = $6 / 4 = $1.50

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is consistent across all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.50.

3. For the third package:
   - 8 sandwiches
   - Cost = 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12

The package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12."
"First, we need to determine the remaining amount Tom needs to pay after selling his old bedroom set. He buys a new one for $3000 and sells his old one for $1000, so the remaining amount is:

\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% of this remaining amount each month. To find out how much he needs to pay per month, we calculate 10% of $2000:

\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ 200 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst due to the wind. 

\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]

So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving her with:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of her 12 yellow balloons:

\[ 12 \times 0.50 = 6 \]

This means she lost 6 yellow balloons, leaving her with:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

As Sally neared the school, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons. 

\[ 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]

So, she added 6 blue balloons to her collection. Now, we sum up all the balloons she has:

\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 6 \text{ (blue)} = 27 \]

Therefore, the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school is:

\[ 27 \]"
"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.5
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. So, the probability of not having to turn in his homework in this scenario is 100% or 1.0.

2. **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.4
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.6
   - If the normal teacher gives an extension, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. So, the probability of not having to turn in his homework in this scenario is 0.4.

3. **Normal Teacher without Extension, Marcus Gets a Personal Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.6
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension: 20% or 0.2
   - Probability of Marcus not getting a personal extension: 80% or 0.8
   - If Marcus does not get a personal extension, he has to turn in his homework. So, the probability of having to turn in his homework in this scenario is 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.48.

Now, we combine these probabilities:

- Probability of having a substitute teacher and not having to turn in homework: 0.5 * 1.0 = 0.5
- Probability of the normal teacher coming in, giving an extension, and not having to turn in homework: 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2
- Probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension, and Marcus not getting a personal extension, and having to turn in homework: 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.24

The total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of the scenarios where he does not get an extension:

0.24

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

24%"
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats already allocated for graduates and faculty.
2. Subtract this number from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center to find out how many seats are available for tickets to be given to friends and family.
3. Divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Seats for graduates and faculty: \(950 + 300 = 1250\)
2. Available seats for tickets: \(6000 - 1250 = 4750\)
3. Number of graduates: (Not given, so let's assume the number of graduates is \(G\))
4. Tickets per graduate: \(\frac{4750}{G}\)

Since the number of graduates (\(G\)) is not provided, we can't give a specific numerical answer. However, if we assume the number of graduates is, for example, 500, then:

\(\frac{4750}{500} = 9.5\)

So, if there are 500 graduates, each would receive 9.5 tickets.

Final numerical answer (assuming 500 graduates): 9.5 tickets per graduate."
"To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish the relationship between the different sizes of jelly beans.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium jelly beans as large jelly beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium jelly beans Grandpa can eat is \( 2 \times 75 = 150 \).

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium jelly bean.
   - Therefore, the number of small jelly beans equivalent to one medium jelly bean is 3.
   - Since Grandpa can eat 150 medium jelly beans, the number of small jelly beans he can eat is \( 150 \times 3 = 450 \).

So, Grandpa can eat \(\boxed{450}\) small jelly beans."

"To determine how many seconds it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of soda bottles Richard will place.
2. Determine the total time it takes to place all the bottles and drop the candy.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of soda bottles.**

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard places a bottle every 3 feet. This means the number of intervals between bottles is 24 / 3 = 8. Since there is a bottle at the start and one at the end of each interval, the total number of bottles is 8 + 1 = 9.

**Step 2: Determine the total time.**

Richard takes 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next and drop the candy. Since there are 8 intervals between the 9 bottles, the total time is 8 * 5 = 40 seconds.

**Final Answer:**

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim borrowed for college, the total income he would have earned without going to college, and the total income he will earn with his college degree. Then, we can determine how long it will take for him to earn back the money he spent on college and the money he lost by not working.

1. **Calculate the total amount borrowed for college:**
   - Jim borrows $50,000 per year for 4 years.
   - Total amount borrowed = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

2. **Calculate the total income lost from not working while in school:**
   - Jim's annual income before college was $25,000.
   - Total income lost = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn back:**
   - Total amount to earn back = Total amount borrowed + Total income lost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

4. **Calculate Jim's new annual income after earning a college degree:**
   - His income is tripled, so his new annual income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000.

5. **Determine how long it will take to earn back the $300,000:**
   - Time to earn back = Total amount to earn back / Annual income with degree = $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces he requires. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece is:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece is:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric he needs to buy is:
\[ \text{Total area} = 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
   - So, he won \(10 + 1 = 11\) dollars.

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - He won $11 in the second race, so he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount won and lost:

- Total amount lost: \(5 + 16.5 = 21.5\) dollars.
- Total amount won: \(11\) dollars.

The net amount lost is the total amount lost minus the total amount won:
\[21.5 - 11 = 10.5\] dollars.

Since he participated in 3 races, the average loss per race is:
\[\frac{10.5}{3} = 3.5\] dollars.

**Final numerical answer:**

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches since the growth is given in inches.

Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's original height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
After growing 3 inches, Xavier's current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem, the second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation as:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is $420."
"To determine the total hours of work each painter put in, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days the painters worked.
2. Determine the total fraction of a day worked each day.
3. Convert the fraction of a day into hours.
4. Calculate the total hours worked by the team.
5. Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours each painter worked.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The team worked for 3 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days they worked is:
   \[
   3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}
   \]

2. Each day, the team worked for \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day.

3. To find out how many hours this is, we convert \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day into hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day:
   \[
   \frac{3}{8} \text{ of a day} = \frac{3}{8} \times 24 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. Now, we calculate the total hours worked by the team over the 21 days:
   \[
   21 \text{ days} \times 9 \text{ hours/day} = 189 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. Finally, we divide the total hours by the number of painters (4) to find out how many hours each painter worked:
   \[
   \frac{189 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ painters}} = 47.25 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, each painter put in 47.25 hours of work."
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
1. In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
2. In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
3. The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) + 2(4) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + x + 8 = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is \( \boxed{10} \)."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% of its value each year (100% - 21% = 79%).

Let's calculate the value of the car for each year:

1. **2007**: The initial value is $20,000.
2. **2008**: The value after one year of depreciation is $20,000 * 0.79.
3. **2009**: The value after two years of depreciation is ($20,000 * 0.79) * 0.79.
4. **2010**: The value after three years of depreciation is [($20,000 * 0.79) * 0.79] * 0.79.

Let's do the calculations step by step:

- **2008**: $20,000 * 0.79 = $15,800
- **2009**: $15,800 * 0.79 = $12,482
- **2010**: $12,482 * 0.79 = $9,849.78

Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,849.78."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of English books.
2. Calculate the number of German books.
3. Subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books.

Step 1: Calculate the number of English books.
Half of the 50 books are in English, so:
\[ \text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of German books.
10% of the 50 books are in German, so:
\[ \text{Number of German books} = 50 \times \frac{10}{100} = 5 \]

Step 3: Calculate the number of Spanish books.
Subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:
\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (\text{Number of English books} + \text{Number of German books}) \]
\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (25 + 5) = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, there are 20 Spanish books in the library."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we first calculate the total distance she has already covered and then subtract this from the total distance between San Diego and New York City.

Distance driven in 4 days: \(325 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 1300 \, \text{km}\)

Total distance from San Diego to New York City: \(1955 \, \text{km}\)

Distance remaining: \(1955 \, \text{km} - 1300 \, \text{km} = 655 \, \text{km}\)

Bernice still needs to drive \(\boxed{655}\) kilometers."
"Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Over 30 days, she would drink:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, the number of gallons she drinks in 30 days is:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people descend, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 people descend. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110
   \]

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is:
\[
110

"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Tank top**: $10
2. **Running shorts**: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. **Tennis shoes**: Originally $48, on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. **Athletic socks**: Package costs $8, but with a $2 coupon, the cost is $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up all the costs:

- Tank top: $10
- Running shorts: $15
- Tennis shoes: $24
- Athletic socks: $6

Total cost = $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55

Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To determine the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor with the new square floor tiles, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of tiles needed.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of tiles and their cost per tile.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of tiles needed.**

Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is:
\[ 1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt} \]

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt. Therefore, the number of tiles needed is:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ SqFt}}{1 \text{ SqFt per tile}} = 200 \text{ tiles} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost.**

Each tile costs $12. Therefore, the total cost for 200 tiles is:
\[ 200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars per tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

**Final Answer:**
\[ \text{The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor is } \$2400. \]"
"First, we need to calculate the increased monthly cost of the insurance after the accident. The normal cost is $120 a month, and it increased by 60%. 

To find the increased amount, we calculate 60% of $120:
\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the new monthly cost is the original cost plus the increase:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Now, to find the annual cost, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for the insurance."
"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of sheets Greg uses in a year.
2. Determine how many loads of laundry he needs to wash these sheets based on the machine's capacity.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of sheets used in a year.**

- Greg uses 4 twin sheets per week and 1 king sheet per week.
- There are 52 weeks in a year.

So, the total number of twin sheets used in a year is:
\[ 4 \text{ sheets/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 208 \text{ twin sheets/year} \]

And the total number of king sheets used in a year is:
\[ 1 \text{ sheet/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 52 \text{ king sheets/year} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of loads of laundry needed.**

- The machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time and 1 king set at a time.
- Therefore, for the twin sheets, the number of loads needed is:
\[ \frac{208 \text{ twin sheets}}{2 \text{ twin sets/load}} = 104 \text{ loads} \]

- For the king sheets, the number of loads needed is:
\[ \frac{52 \text{ king sheets}}{1 \text{ king set/load}} = 52 \text{ loads} \]

- Adding these together gives the total number of loads of laundry:
\[ 104 \text{ loads} + 52 \text{ loads} = 156 \text{ loads} \]

**Final Answer:**
156"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Movies watched on Saturday**: Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday.
2. **Movies watched on Sunday**: They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday. So, on Sunday, they watch \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) movies.
3. **Total movies watched in one weekend**: The total number of movies watched in one weekend (Saturday + Sunday) is \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) movies.
4. **Total movies watched in 4 weeks**: Since they watch movies every weekend, in 4 weeks, they will watch \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \) movies.

Therefore, the total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks is 24."
"To determine the total number of stickers in Leo's collection, we need to calculate the number of stickers he added each year and then sum them up.

1. Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
2. Last year, he collected 50 stickers. So, the total number of stickers at the end of last year is:
   \[
   100 + 50 = 150
   \]
3. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as last year. Therefore, the number of stickers he collected this year is:
   \[
   2 \times 50 = 100
   \]
4. Adding this year's collection to the total from last year gives:
   \[
   150 + 100 = 250

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food consumed per day and then divide the total amount of cat food by this daily consumption.

1. Calculate the daily consumption of cat food:
   - Imma has 3 cats.
   - Each cat is fed 60 grams of food twice a day.
   - Therefore, each cat consumes \(60 \, \text{grams} \times 2 = 120 \, \text{grams}\) per day.
   - For 3 cats, the total daily consumption is \(120 \, \text{grams} \times 3 = 360 \, \text{grams}\).

2. Calculate how many days 720 grams of cat food will last:
   - Total cat food available: 720 grams.
   - Daily consumption: 360 grams.
   - Number of days the food will last: \( \frac{720 \, \text{grams}}{360 \, \text{grams/day}} = 2 \, \text{days} \).

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"Given that Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can determine how many slices Jake ate. If Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, then Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices.

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \(2 \times 7 = 14\) slices.

Now, let's add up all the slices they ate:
- Becky: 10 slices
- Jake: 7 slices
- Silvia: 14 slices

Total slices eaten = \(10 + 7 + 14 = 31\)

The total number of slices they ate is 31."
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \(D\) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, we can express Betsy's part as \(D + 18\) minutes.

The total time for the meal is the sum of both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[D + (D + 18) = 98\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[2D + 18 = 98\]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[2D = 80\]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[D = 40\]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part is 18 minutes longer, we calculate Betsy's part as:

\[40 + 18 = 58\]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long."
"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to add up all the individual charges:

1. **Cast**: $200
2. **Doctor's Visit**: The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the charge would be half of $300, which is $150.
3. **Painkillers**: $4 per pill for 30 pills, which totals $4 * 30 = $120.
4. **Parking**: $6 per hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours, which totals $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, we add all these charges together:

$200 (cast) + $150 (doctor's visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"First, let's calculate the number of emails that don't require any response:

20% of 80 emails = 0.20 * 80 = 16 emails

These 16 emails don't need a response, so the number of emails that James needs to respond to each day is:

80 emails - 16 emails = 64 emails

Now, to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week:

64 emails/day * 5 days = 320 emails

So, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes for each day and then sum them up.

"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate and how many are left from their order.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the glee club's order is:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ate and how many are left from their order.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the football team's order is:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas} \]

Finally, to find the total number of pizzas left, we add the remaining pizzas from both the glee club and the football team:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 14 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send out. Since he wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he is sending out 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

\[ 24500 \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Order by Sidney:**
   - Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches.
   - So, Sidney ordered \(10 - 3 = 7\) meatball sub sandwiches.

2. **Mark's Consumption:**
   - Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches.
   - After Mark ate 4, Sidney had \(7 - 4 = 3\) meatball sub sandwiches left.

3. **Additional Order by Sidney:**
   - Sidney then ordered another three sub sandwiches.
   - So, Sidney now has \(3 + 3 = 6\) meatball sub sandwiches in total.

4. **Calculating the Total Number of Meatballs:**
   - Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.
   - Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the 6 meatball sub sandwiches is \(6 \times 4 = 24\).

"First, we need to determine the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures. Since a quarter of the 20 trucks had mechanical issues, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]

So, 5 trucks could not deliver the fertiliser. This means that the remaining trucks, which can deliver the fertiliser, are:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Each of these 15 trucks was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[ 15 \times 20 = 300 \]

Total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day: 300."
"Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. Since he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter he buys, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.

Let's calculate the cost without the promotion first:
- Cost per pound of butter = $4.00
- Total pounds of butter needed = 6
- Total cost without promotion = 6 * $4.00 = $24.00

Now, let's apply the promotion:
- For every pound of butter, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.
- This means for every 1.5 pounds of butter, he only pays for 1 pound.

To find out how many sets of 1.5 pounds he can get from 6 pounds:
- 6 pounds / 1.5 pounds per set = 4 sets

For each set, he pays for 1 pound and gets 0.5 pounds for free, so the cost for each set is:
- Cost for 1 pound = $4.00

Since he gets 4 sets, the total cost is:
- Total cost with promotion = 4 * $4.00 = $16.00

Therefore, the cost to purchase 6 pounds of butter with the promotion is $16.00."
"First, let's calculate the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- 25 classmates
- 7 girls in her dance class
- 13 family members

Total guests invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Since 4 people said they could not come, the actual number of guests attending the party is:

45 - 4 = 41

The cost to rent the theater is $125, and there is an additional $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20. So, the number of additional guests is:

41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is:

21 * $6 = $126

Adding the rental fee to the cost for the additional guests gives us the total cost:

$125 + $126 = $251

The party will cost $251."
"Let's start by calculating how much money Maggie and Riza each had initially.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has three-quarters of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times \text{Maggie's initial money} = 60
\]

Solving for Maggie's initial money:

\[
\text{Maggie's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
\]

Similarly, Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has two-thirds of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times \text{Riza's initial money} = 60
\]

Solving for Riza's initial money:

\[
\text{Riza's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
\]

Now, let's calculate how much money each of them had initially and how much they have left.

Maggie initially had $80 and spent a quarter, so she has $60 left.
Riza initially had $90 and spent one-third, so she has $60 left.

Adding the amounts they have left:

\[
60 + 60 = 120
\]

Therefore, the two of them have a total of $120 left."
"First, let's determine the total number of bananas each monkey eats in a week.

- The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. So, in a week (7 days), the first monkey eats \(10 \times 7 = 70\) bananas.
- The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day, so it eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day. In a week, the second monkey eats \(14 \times 7 = 98\) bananas.
- The total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a week is \(70 + 98 = 168\) bananas.

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas to feed the three monkeys for a week, the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week is \(315 - 168 = 147\) bananas.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide the weekly total by 7:
\[ \frac{147}{7} = 21 \]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

Final answer:
21"
"Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed 250 pieces. Then, he started and finished another 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed all 500 pieces of the second puzzle.

To find the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we add the pieces from both puzzles together:

250 pieces (from the first puzzle) + 500 pieces (from the second puzzle) = 750 pieces

Therefore, Teddy placed 750 puzzle pieces during that hour."
"First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since roses can be bought at $2 each, the total cost for 15 roses is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which totals:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she needs an additional $5 to cover the cost. The florist does not have enough change in quarters to cover the exact amount, so Jenny would need to find the remaining $5 elsewhere or the florist would need to find a way to give her change in a different form. However, based on the information given, we can only calculate the change she would receive if she had enough money.

If the florist could give her change in quarters, the $5 change would be:

\[ \$5 \times 100 \text{ cents} = 500 \text{ cents} \]

Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the number of quarters she would receive is:

\[ 500 \text{ cents} \div 25 \text{ cents/quarter} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, if the florist could give her change in quarters, Jenny would leave with:

\[ 20 \text{ quarters} \]"

"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find the difference between the time Paul boards the fourth train and the time he arrives at the station.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Departs after 30 minutes (10 minutes arrival + 20 minutes stay).

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train departs, which is 60 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Stays for a quarter of the first train's stay time, which is 5 minutes (20 minutes / 4).
   - Departs after 65 minutes (60 minutes arrival + 5 minutes stay).

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train departs, which is 125 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Leaves immediately after arriving, so it departs at 125 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train departs, which is 145 minutes after the first train arrives.

Paul will board the fourth train at 145 minutes after he arrives at the station. Since he arrives at the station at the start (0 minutes), he will wait 145 minutes for his train.

**Final Answer:**

"Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. To find out how many toothpicks she has already saved, we multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week by the number of weeks:

\[ 10 \, \text{toothpicks/week} \times 12 \, \text{weeks} = 120 \, \text{toothpicks} \]

She needs a total of 200 toothpicks for the sculpture. To find out how many more toothpicks she needs, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total required:

\[ 200 \, \text{toothpicks} - 120 \, \text{toothpicks} = 80 \, \text{toothpicks} \]

Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, to find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

\[ \frac{80 \, \text{toothpicks}}{10 \, \text{toothpicks/week}} = 8 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price, which is $2000.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to calculate the difference between the original price and the price Mr. Rogers' friend paid, and then express this difference as a percentage of the original price.

\[ \text{Discount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, a single spring creates 1 jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - 1 minute = 60 seconds
   - Therefore, 4 hours = 4 × 60 × 60 = 14,400 seconds

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since 1 jellyfish is created every second, in 14,400 seconds, one spring will create 14,400 jellyfish.

4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14,400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create 5 × 14,400 = 72,000 jellyfish.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
72,000 jellyfish."
"Frankie's score was 15 better than twice Binkie's score. Binkie's score was 90.

First, calculate twice Binkie's score:
2 * 90 = 180

Then add 15 to this amount to find Frankie's score:
180 + 15 = 195

Frankie's score was 195."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. James's home is 4 miles from the store.
2. He walks halfway to the store, which is 2 miles.
3. He then walks back home, covering another 2 miles.
4. He then walks the full 4 miles to the store.

The total distance James walks is:
- 2 miles (to halfway point)
- 2 miles (back home)
- 4 miles (to the store)

So, the total distance is 2 + 2 + 4 = 8 miles.

James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find the time it takes to walk 8 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it took James 2 hours to reach the store."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from the bunches. Since each bunch contains an average of 4 bananas and she buys 10 bunches, the total number of bananas is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas/bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we calculate the cost if Jenny had bought these bananas individually. At $0.80 per banana, the total cost would be:

\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80/\text{banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since she buys 10 bunches at $3.00 per bunch, the total cost is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00/\text{bunch} = \$30.00 \]

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:

\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Jenny saved \(\$2.00\) by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \).

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total length of the fence is 100 feet.
2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.

We can express these as equations:
\[ S + H = 100 \]
\[ H = S + 60 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]
\[ 2S = 40 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to determine the growth rate per year. 

Given that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, we can calculate the annual growth rate as follows:

\[ \text{Annual growth rate} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \]

Now, to find out how much it will grow in 13 years, we multiply the annual growth rate by 13:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"First, let's calculate the number of each type of bike sold:

1. **Trekking bikes**: Half of the total bikes sold, which is \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \) bikes.
2. **BMX bikes**: 15% of the total bikes sold, which is \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \) bikes.
3. **MTB bikes**: The rest of the bikes sold, which is \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \) bikes.

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:

1. **Earnings from Trekking bikes**: \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \) dollars.
2. **Earnings from BMX bikes**: \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \) dollars (since a BMX bike costs half the price of an MTB, which is \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \) dollars).
3. **Earnings from MTB bikes**: \( 105 \times 500 = 52500 \) dollars.

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes:

\[ 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = 131250 \]

Marcel earned a total of $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the rate of hay production and pickup:**
   - The farmer makes 5 bales of hay per hour.
   - The truck picks up 3 bales of hay per hour.

2. **Calculate the net change in the number of hay bales per hour:**
   - Net change per hour = Hay produced - Hay picked up
   - Net change per hour = 5 bales - 3 bales = 2 bales

3. **Calculate the total net change over 6 hours:**
   - Total net change = Net change per hour * Number of hours
   - Total net change = 2 bales/hour * 6 hours = 12 bales

4. **Determine the number of bales left in the field after 6 hours:**
   - Since the farmer starts with no bales in the field (assuming the field was empty before starting), the number of bales left in the field after 6 hours is the total net change.
   - Number of bales left = 12 bales

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field after a 6-hour day is 12."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long. Therefore, the total time spent in classes each weekday is:

\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total time spent in classes during the weekdays is:

\[ 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on these days. First, we find \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly class time:

\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he spends this time equally on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time per week is:

\[ 100 \text{ minutes} \times 2 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent in classes and the extra learning time to get the total weekly learning time:

\[ 1600 \text{ minutes} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, John spends 30 hours a week learning."
"To find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped.
2. Calculate the height after the first bounce.
3. Calculate the height after the second bounce.

The initial height from which the ball is dropped is 3 stories high, with each story being 24 feet. So, the initial height is:
\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. So, the height after the first bounce is:
\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

For the second bounce, the ball will again bounce to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce. So, the height after the second bounce is:
\[ 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:
\[ \boxed{32 \text{ feet}} \]"
"Let's break down the heights step by step:

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child's height in inches is:
   \[ 6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

2. The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so:
   \[ 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches} \]

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so:
   \[ 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches} \]

4. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so:
   \[ 69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we first need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now, if each bag is sold for $5, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag to find the total earnings:

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the Triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the Triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The Velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus ate the remaining 270 kilograms, so \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \) kilograms.

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the Triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate."
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are 10 feet by 8 feet, so each wall has an area of \(10 \times 8 = 80\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is \(80 \times 2 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are 5 feet by 8 feet, so each wall has an area of \(5 \times 8 = 40\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is \(40 \times 2 = 80\) square feet.

Adding these together, the total area to be painted is \(160 + 80 = 240\) square feet.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is \(240 \div 20 = 12\) gallons.

Finally, since each gallon costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is \(12 \times 12 = 144\) dollars.

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is $144."

"To find out how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

1. The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, the distance it has traveled is:
   \[
   60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is:
   \[
   \frac{60 \, \text{miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour}
   \]
   After 3 hours, the distance it has traveled is:
   \[
   30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. Adding the distances traveled by both trains gives the total distance between them:
   \[
   180 \, \text{miles} + 90 \, \text{miles} = 270 \, \text{miles}
   \]

After 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart."
"First, let's calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th. 

- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days.
- April 1st to April 19th is 19 days.

So, the total number of days is \(31 + 19 = 50\) days.

Billy takes 20% of these days off. To find out how many days he takes off, we calculate 20% of 50:

\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the number of days he works is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ days} \]

Billy can help 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day. So, the number of people he helps per day is:

\[ 2 \text{ people/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 6 \text{ people/day} \]

Now, to find out how many people he helps in 40 days, we multiply the number of people he helps per day by the number of days he works:

\[ 6 \text{ people/day} \times 40 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ people} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 240 \]"
"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry, as these would be the people who attended the ceremony.

First, let's calculate the number of people that the buses could carry:
- There were 12 buses.
- Each bus carried 35 people.

So, the total number of people carried by the buses is:
\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people/bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of people that the cars could carry:
- There were 20 cars.
- Each car carried 3 people.

So, the total number of people carried by the cars is:
\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people/car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Now, we add the number of people carried by the buses and the cars to find the total number of people inside the church:

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old."
"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute

Time = Length / Speed
Time for the biggest slide = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute

Time = Length / Speed
Time for the second biggest slide = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time:
Difference = Time for the biggest slide - Time for the second biggest slide
Difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

It takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"First, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks each day.

- Lunch: 30 minutes
- Breaks: 2 breaks × 15 minutes each = 30 minutes

Total time per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, Bobby spends 1 hour each day on lunch and breaks.

Over 5 days, the total time spent on lunch and breaks is:

1 hour/day × 5 days = 5 hours

Therefore, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours."
"First, let's calculate how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (\text{Amber's distance} + \text{Micah's distance}) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (8 + 28) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - 36 \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Ahito ran 16 miles."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Sheila initially charged $85.00.
2. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract this from the initial charge: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.
3. She then bought a frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00. The sale price of the frying pan is: $20.00 - (20% of $20.00) = $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.
4. She also bought a set of towels on sale for 10% off $30.00. The sale price of the towels is: $30.00 - (10% of $30.00) = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.
5. Adding the sale prices of the frying pan and the towels to the remaining balance: $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00.

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. This means that \( \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \).

To find the total number of jellyfish \( J \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]
\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90."

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old."
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs for her retirement and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount given her current savings rate.

1. **Calculate the annual retirement expense:**
   Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary during retirement.
   \[
   \text{Annual retirement expense} = 0.40 \times \$100,000 = \$40,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the total retirement savings needed:**
   Lauren plans to live off this amount for 20 years.
   \[
   \text{Total retirement savings needed} = \$40,000 \times 20 = \$800,000

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her retirement."
"Marty starts with 100 centimeters of ribbon. He first cuts this into 4 equal parts. To find the length of each of these parts, we divide 100 by 4:

\[ \frac{100}{4} = 25 \text{ centimeters} \]

Each of these 25 centimeter parts is then divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these final parts, we divide 25 by 5:

\[ \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ centimeters} \]

So, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long."
"To find the total school population, we start by noting that 40% of the school population is 240 boys. Let's denote the total school population by \( P \).

Given:
\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ P = 600 \]

So, the total school population is 600.

Since 40% of the school population is boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of the total population:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."

"To find the average height of the heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide by the number of women.

First, we calculate the total height of the heels:
- Three women are wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

Adding these together gives the total height of all the heels:
\[12 + 6 = 18\] inches.

Next, we find the average height by dividing the total height by the number of women:
\[ \text{Average height} = \frac{18}{6} = 3 \] inches.

The average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike.
2. Determine the total number of days in June.
3. Calculate the total miles she plans to hike per day.
4. Determine how many more miles per day she needs to hike to meet her goal.

Step 1: Total miles to hike
Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles.

Step 2: Total number of days in June
June has 30 days.

Step 3: Calculate the total miles she plans to hike per day
Soledad plans to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, she plans to hike:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/time} \times 2 \text{ times/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Step 4: Determine how many more miles per day she needs to hike
To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we divide the total miles by the number of days and then subtract her planned daily hike:
\[ \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]
\[ 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"First, let's determine how much Pierre and Paul want in kilograms.

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \, \text{kg} \]

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \, \text{kg} \]

Together, Pierre and Paul want:
\[ 3 \, \text{kg} + 4 \, \text{kg} = 7 \, \text{kg} \]

Since Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples in total, the amount left for Jacques (and James, assuming the question meant Jacques) is:
\[ 12 \, \text{kg} - 7 \, \text{kg} = 5 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, James will have 5 kilograms of apples left."

2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius.

Then it increased by 3 degrees, so the temperature became:

-6 + 3 = -3 degrees Celsius.

Therefore, the temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Raymond starts with $21.
2. He saves an additional $11 from his allowance.
3. He spends $5 on a comic book.
4. He spends $19 on a puzzle.

First, we add the money he saved to his initial amount:
\[ 21 + 11 = 32 \]

Next, we subtract the cost of the comic book:
\[ 32 - 5 = 27 \]

Then, we subtract the cost of the puzzle:
\[ 27 - 19 = 8 \]

So, the final amount of money Raymond has left is:
\[ 8 \]

Therefore, Raymond has $8 left."
"First, let's determine how much money Anna spent in total. She started with a budget of $16 and has $2 left after her purchases. Therefore, the total amount spent is:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Anna had already spent $4 before buying the 2 books today. So, the amount spent on the 2 books is:

\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Since she bought 2 books at the same price, the cost of each book is:

\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Each book cost Anna $5."
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we first calculate the increase in enrollment, which is 20% of last year's enrollment. Last year, there were 50 students.

20% of 50 is calculated as:
\[ 50 \times \frac{20}{100} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

So, there is an increase of 10 students this year. To find the total number of students this year, we add this increase to last year's enrollment:

\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60."
"To determine how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times, we first need to find the rate at which the light blinks.

Given that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, we can calculate the rate of blinking as follows:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times at this rate. We can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times."
"Initially, Tate has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

After buying more fish, Tate has:
- 4 + 2 = 6 male guppies
- 7 + 1 = 8 female guppies
- 3 + 2 = 5 male goldfishes
- 5 + 3 = 8 female goldfishes

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes = 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11
- Total female fishes = 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16

The difference between the number of female and male fishes is:
- 16 (female) - 11 (male) = 5

Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes."
"To solve this problem, let's break down the time each person took to complete their chores:

1. **Amalia's time**: Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.
2. **Megan's time**: Megan's chore took 2 hours longer than Amalia's, so Megan took \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours to walk the dog.
3. **Dior's time**: Dior's chore took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia's, so Dior took \(4 + 4 + 1 = 9\) hours to do laundry (since ""well over 4 hours"" means at least 5 hours, and the smallest integer over 4 is 5, but to ensure ""well over,"" we can use 9 as a clear example).

Now, we add up the time each person took:

- Amalia: 4 hours
- Megan: 6 hours
- Dior: 9 hours

Total time = \(4 + 6 + 9 = 19\) hours.

Therefore, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 19 hours."
"To determine the total miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the one-way distance:**
   - John drives for 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles (one way)

2. **Calculate the round trip distance:**
   - Round trip distance = 2 × One-way distance
   - Round trip distance = 2 × 140 miles = 280 miles

3. **Calculate the total distance for all visits in a month:**
   - John visits his parents twice a month.
   - Total distance = Round trip distance × Number of visits
   - Total distance = 280 miles × 2 = 560 miles

Therefore, the total miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents is 560 miles."
"Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. Over 7 days, she will walk:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, the distance Brian walks in 7 days is half of what Sofie walks in 7 days:

\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers and then determine how many toys the fifth worker must produce to meet the order.

First, let's calculate the production of the first four workers:

- The first two workers produce 6 toys an hour each. Together, they produce \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.
- The next two workers produce 4 toys an hour each. Together, they produce \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.

So, the total production of the first four workers per hour is \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

Since they work for 10 hours, the total production by the first four workers is \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys.

The order requires 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. This means that the first four workers have produced \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

Since the first four workers have produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced the remaining \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked:

\[
\frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys per hour}
\]

Therefore, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog. Since Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds, Elijah's first dog weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog. So, Elijah's second dog weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the total weight of all the dogs, we add the weights of Kory's dog and Elijah's two dogs:

\[ 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is 105 pounds."
"Let's work backwards from the information given:

1. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris originally had \(9 + 7 = 16\) stickers.
2. Luis gave all of his stickers to Kris, so Luis had 16 stickers before giving them to Kris.
3. Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris, so the 16 stickers he had were the other half. Therefore, Luis originally had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.
4. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Seth originally had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

Therefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of M&M that John has:

3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces

Next, we calculate the total number of M&M he has:

30 ounces * 30 M&M per ounce = 900 M&M

Now, we need to determine how many small bags he can make if each small bag contains 10 M&M:

900 M&M / 10 M&M per small bag = 90 small bags

Therefore, John can make 90 small bags."
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate half of the circumference of the earth.
2. Divide this distance by the distance Alfie flies each day to find the number of days.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the daily distance:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."
"To find out how fast the fastest car goes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use that to find the speed of the fastest car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so we calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we calculate the speed of the fastest car as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour."
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old. Therefore, Vince is now 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

Vince is now 9 years old."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted.
2. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, Madeline also painted \( A \) eggs.
3. Let \( C \) be the number of eggs Camden painted.
4. Since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, Sarah painted \( 30 - C \) eggs.
5. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so \( C = (30 - C) + 12 \).

From the last equation, we can solve for \( C \):
\[ C = 30 - C + 12 \]
\[ 2C = 42 \]
\[ C = 21 \]

So, Camden painted 21 eggs. Since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, Sarah painted:
\[ 30 - 21 = 9 \]

Now, we know the total number of eggs painted by Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah is 56. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and we know Camden and Sarah's totals, we can confirm:
\[ A + A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Arnold painted 13 eggs. Camden painted 21 eggs. The difference in the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold is:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

8"
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Since each group of crayons will be placed in a box, Nik will need 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. Therefore, the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Weight of crayons} = 200 \times 1 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

The total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Weight of boxes} = 25 \times 8 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

To convert the total weight from ounces to pounds, we use the conversion factor that 1 pound = 16 ounces:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400}{16} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much of the tree can be turned into logs. John can make logs out of 80% of the 80-foot tree:

\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs can be cut from the 64 feet of usable wood:

\[ \frac{64}{4} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

From each log, John cuts 5 planks. Therefore, the total number of planks he can get from all the logs is:

\[ 16 \times 5 = 80 \text{ planks} \]

If he sells each plank for $1.2, the total amount he makes is:

\[ 80 \times 1.2 = 96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{96} \]"
"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns $5000 per month and this is half of what her brother earns, her brother earns:

\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we calculate their combined salary:
\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so:
\[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we add up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother to find the total amount of money they all have together:
\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all have together is:
\[ 45000 \]"
"Given that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach and the beach portion of her walk is 2 miles, we can determine her speed on the beach. Let's denote her speed on the beach as \(v\) miles per minute. Therefore, we have:

\[2 \text{ miles} = 40 \text{ minutes} \times v \]
\[v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute}\]

Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:

\[2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}\]

The sidewalk portion of her walk is 1 mile. Using her speed on the sidewalk, the time spent walking on the sidewalk is:

\[1 \text{ mile} = \text{time} \times \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}\]
\[\text{time} = 1 \text{ mile} \times 10 \text{ minutes per mile} = 10 \text{ minutes}\]

Adding the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, the total time for the 3-mile walk is:

\[40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 50 minutes."
"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate how much Jane has saved so far.
2. Determine how much more she needs to save to reach $60.
3. Calculate how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining amount.

Step 1: Calculate how much Jane has saved so far.
Jane saves $4 every week. Over 8 weeks, she has saved:
\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 2: Determine how much more she needs to save to reach $60.
The total amount she wants to save is $60. She has already saved $32, so she needs:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 3: Calculate how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining amount.
Since she saves $4 each week, the number of weeks needed to save $28 is:
\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."
"To find the total number of blue birds in the trees, we can break down the problem into parts and then sum the results.

   \(3 \times 7 = 21\) blue birds

2. For the 2 trees each with 4 blue birds:
   \(2 \times 4 = 8\) blue birds

3. For the 1 tree with 3 blue birds:
   \(1 \times 3 = 3\) blue birds

Now, we add these numbers together to get the total number of blue birds:
\(21 + 8 + 3 = 32\)

Therefore, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob originally has. We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. Therefore, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. This means that before receiving the 24 marbles, Bob had:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob originally has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 of these marbles, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 26 \]"
"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug, we need to consider the scenario where the temperature of the water from the second mug, after mixing, is just at the threshold of 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the resulting mixture must be at least 40 degrees. The total volume of the mixture is 5 ounces, and the total heat content of the mixture can be calculated as follows:

The heat content of the 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug is \( 4 \times 33 = 132 \) degree-ounce units.

The heat content of the 1 ounce from the second mug is \( 1 \times T = T \) degree-ounce units.

The average temperature of the mixture, which must be at least 40 degrees, can be expressed as:
\[ \frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40 \]

To find the minimum value of \( T \), we solve the inequality:
\[ 132 + T \geq 200 \]
\[ T \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the mixture."
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over the three-week period and then add these to the initial numbers.

1. **Initial number of cows**: 50
2. **Cows added per day**: 20
3. **Number of days in three weeks**: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days
4. **Total cows added in three weeks**: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
5. **Total cows after three weeks**: 50 initial cows + 420 cows added = 470 cows

6. **Initial number of chickens**: 20
7. **Chickens added per day**: 10
8. **Total chickens added in three weeks**: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens
9. **Total chickens after three weeks**: 20 initial chickens + 210 chickens added = 230 chickens

10. **Total number of animals after three weeks**: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

**Final numerical answer:**

"First, let's calculate the total cost for 4 packs of bagels before the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times \$10.00 = \$40.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total:
\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels/pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost per bagel by dividing the total cost by the number of bagels:
\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \text{ per bagel} \]

So, the cost per single bagel is:
\[ \$1.00 \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means Gomer ate \(23 - 5 = 18\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

2. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means it takes \(6 - 3 = 3\) potatoes to make \(3 - 1 = 2\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we need to determine how many sets of 2 scoops are in 18 scoops.
   - There are \(18 \div 2 = 9\) sets of 2 scoops in 18 scoops.

4. Since each set of 2 scoops requires 3 potatoes, for 9 sets, we need \(9 \times 3 = 27\) potatoes.

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes."
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs he consumes over the 60 days.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, he increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of eggs consumed over the 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of red jellybeans.
2. Calculate the total number of green and red jellybeans.
3. Subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans to find the number of blue jellybeans.

Step 1: Jess can see that there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans. Therefore, the number of red jellybeans is:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Step 2: The total number of green and red jellybeans is:
\[ 17 + 34 = 51 \]

Step 3: The total number of jellybeans in the jar is 60. Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is:
\[ 60 - 51 = 9 \]

So, the number of blue jellybeans is \(\boxed{9}\)."

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
300"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the following equation to find the number of men and women:

Let the number of men be \(5x\) and the number of women be \(9x\). The total number of passengers is the sum of men and women, so:

\[5x + 9x = 84\]

\[14x = 84\]

\[x = 6\]

So, the number of men is \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\) and the number of women is \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\).

If 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

\[54 - 20 = 34\]

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the sunflower sales:**
   - Each sunflower is sold for $2.
   - Faraday earns $26 from sunflowers per day.
   - Therefore, the number of sunflowers sold per day is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \).

2. **Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquet sales:**
   - Each bouquet is sold for $8 and contains 12 sunflowers.
   - Faraday earns $56 from bouquets per day.
   - Therefore, the number of bouquets sold per day is \( \frac{56}{8} = 7 \).
   - Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquets is \( 7 \times 12 = 84 \).

3. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day:**
   - Sunflowers from individual sales: 13
   - Sunflowers from bouquets: 84
   - Total sunflowers sold per day: \( 13 + 84 = 97 \).

4. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days:**
   - Total sunflowers sold per day: 97
   - Number of days: 3
   - Total sunflowers sold after 3 days: \( 97 \times 3 = 291 \).

Therefore, Faraday was able to sell 291 sunflowers after 3 days."
"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Since each rock costs $5, we divide $100 by $5:

\[ \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Adam can buy 20 rocks.

Next, we need to find out how many rocks he sells. He sells 60% of his inventory, so we calculate 60% of 20:

\[ 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \]

Adam sells 12 rocks.

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling these 12 rocks. Since he sells each rock for $7, the total revenue is:

\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \]

Adam's initial investment was $100, and his revenue from selling the rocks is $84. The loss is the difference between his initial investment and his revenue:

\[ 100 - 84 = 16 \]

Therefore, Adam loses $16."
"To determine how many days it will take Lauren to create all the picture scenes, we need to calculate the total number of days required for each size of picture scene and then sum these values.

1. **Large-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for large-sized scenes is \( \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) days.

2. **Medium-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for medium-sized scenes is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) days.

3. **Small-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for small-sized scenes is \( \frac{49}{7} = 7 \) days.

Now, we sum the days required for each type of picture scene:
\[ 9 \text{ days} + 6 \text{ days} + 7 \text{ days} = 22 \text{ days} \]

"Chatty prepared three dozen eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, three dozen eggs equal 36 eggs.

To find out how many eggs each child receives, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children:

36 eggs ÷ 4 children = 9 eggs per child

Each child receives 9 eggs."
"Jen has 3 fish, and each fish needs $1 worth of food a day. 

First, calculate the daily food cost for all the fish:
3 fish * $1/fish = $3/day

May has 31 days, so the total cost for the month is:
$3/day * 31 days = $93

Jen spends $93 on food for her fish in the month of May."
"Patricia initially had 30 roses. After giving 24 roses to her mother, she had:

30 - 24 = 6 roses left.

Then, she bought 15 more roses, so she had:

6 + 15 = 21 roses.

Therefore, Patricia now has 21 roses."
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then divide the total distance by the total time.

First, let's calculate the total distance:
- Initial distance: 110 miles
- Additional distance: 140 miles
- Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Next, let's calculate the total time:
- Initial time: 2 hours
- Additional time: 3 hours
- Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, we can find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{250 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour} \]

The average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to first determine the probability of winning for the second ticket.

Given:
- The probability of winning the first ticket is 20%, or 0.20.
- The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket.

So, the probability of winning the second ticket is \(3 \times 0.20 = 0.60\), or 60%.

The probability that both tickets are winners is the product of the individual probabilities of winning each ticket, assuming the events are independent.

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is:
\[0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12\]

Expressed as a percentage, this is:
\[0.12 \times 100 = 12\%\]

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"First, let's determine how many seashells Carlos collected. Since Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected, we can find the number of seashells Carlos collected by subtracting 5 from 27:

\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]

So, Carlos collected 22 seashells.

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. Therefore, we can find the number of seashells Carrey collected by dividing the number of seashells Carlos collected by 2:

\[ 22 \div 2 = 11 \]

So, Carrey collected 11 seashells.

Now, we can find the total number of seashells collected by adding the seashells collected by Jim, Carlos, and Carrey:

\[ 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \]

They gathered all their seashells and divided them equally between themselves. Since there are 3 people, we divide the total number of seashells by 3:

\[ 60 \div 3 = 20 \]

Each person gets 20 seashells.

Final numerical answer:
20"
"Mason eats 4 carrots each weekday. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so he eats:

\[ 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \]

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So for the weekend, he eats:

\[ 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Adding the carrots he eats during the weekdays and the weekend gives:

\[ 20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots} \]

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots a week."
"The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes = 0.60 * 5 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes long.

Now, to find the total length of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs:

5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes

The total cassette time is 13 minutes."
"Linus buys each mobile device for $20. He sells each for twice the original price, which means he sells each for $20 * 2 = $40.

First, let's calculate the profit from selling one device:
Profit per device = Selling price - Buying price = $40 - $20 = $20.

Next, we calculate the total profit from the devices bought last Monday and Tuesday:
- Last Monday, he bought 2 devices, so the profit from Monday's devices is 2 * $20 = $40.
- Last Tuesday, he bought 4 devices, so the profit from Tuesday's devices is 4 * $20 = $80.

Adding the profits from both days:
Total profit = Profit from Monday + Profit from Tuesday = $40 + $80 = $120.

Therefore, the total profit Linus was able to earn after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday is $120."
"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. We know that:

1. Isabel is 7 feet tall.
2. Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned's height is \(7 - 2 = 5\) feet.
3. Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so Carl's height is \(5 + 1 = 6\) feet.
4. Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so the length of Carl's cane is \(\frac{6}{2} = 3\) feet.

Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is 3 feet."
"To satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required based on the information given.

1. Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
2. Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required would be:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles they need to produce, we subtract the current production from the total required:
\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce an additional 7300 bottles of juice to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of octuplets**: 8

   - 3/4 of the octuplets are dressed in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
   - 1/4 of the octuplets are dressed in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

3. **Wearing bows**:
   - All 2 blue-wearers also wear bows.
   - 1/3 of the 6 purple-wearers also wear bows: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

4. **Total number of bow-wearers**:
   - Blue-wearers wearing bows: 2
   - Purple-wearers wearing bows: 2
   - Total bow-wearers: \( 2 + 2 = 4 \)

5. **Probability that a bow-wearer is wearing purple**:
   - Number of purple-wearers wearing bows: 2
   - Total number of bow-wearers: 4
   - Probability: \( \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \)

6. **Convert the probability to a percentage**:

So, the IRS received 1125 tax reports on Wednesday."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
2. He sells half of it for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.
3. After selling 40 square meters, he has 40 square meters left.
4. He then sells another 1/4 of his remaining land for $30. A quarter of 40 square meters is 10 square meters. So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.
5. After these two sales, he has 30 square meters left (40 - 10 = 30).
6. He sells the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter. So, he earns 30 * $3 = $90 from the last sale.

Now, let's add up all the money he earned:
- From the first sale: $50
- From the second sale: $30
- From the third sale: $90

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $90 = $170

Therefore, Abraham will be able to earn $170 after selling all his unused land."
"To find Geb's age, we start by calculating half of Haley's age and then subtract 10 from that value.

Haley's age = 26 years

Half of Haley's age = 26 / 2 = 13 years

Geb's age = Half of Haley's age - 10 = 13 - 10 = 3 years

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old."

For 2 days, the total number of face masks he uses is:

\[ 6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks} \]

Therefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen equals 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei: \(5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\) eggs.

To find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs hidden: \(36 - 27 = 9\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
9 eggs are still hidden in the yard."
"First, let's calculate the number of apartments in the third complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have \(200 + 200 = 400\) apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than this combined total, so it has \(400 + 0.60 \times 400 = 400 + 240 = 640\) apartments.

Next, we calculate the total number of apartments John collects from all three complexes:
\[200 + 200 + 640 = 1040\]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, so the total number of collections per week is:
\[1040 \times 3 = 3120\]

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so the total amount of money he makes in a week is:
\[3120 \times 0.40 = 1248\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[1248\]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **5-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. Let's denote the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces as \(x\). So, the 8-year-old tree produces \(x - 200\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old avocado tree**: Doesn't produce any fruit.
6. **10-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we need to find the value of \(x\) (the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces). According to the problem, the 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than the 10-year-old tree, so:
\[x - 200 = 150\]
\[x = 150 + 200\]
\[x = 350\]

So, a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits, which is consistent with the problem statement.

Now, let's sum up the total number of fruits produced over the 10 years:
\[50 + 150 + 350 + 0 + 1000 = 1650\]

Therefore, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is **1650**."
"First, let's determine how much money Sophia gave to Jack. Sophia had $100 and gave Jack 1/5 of that amount.

\[ \text{Amount given by Sophia} = \frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20 \]

\[ \text{Jack's total amount} = 100 + 20 = 120 \]

So, Jack now has $120."
"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters, and the length of the red rope as \( R \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we can express \( Y \) in terms of \( B \) using the second relationship:
\[ Y = B + 7 \]

Now, we substitute \( R \) and \( Y \) in terms of \( B \) into the third equation:
\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 5 \]

Now, we can find \( R \) using the first relationship:
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters."

1. **Determine the initial amounts of money given to Ronnie and Rissa:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.**

3. **After giving money to their sister, the amounts left are:**
   - Ronnie: \(5 - x\)
   - Rissa: \(15 - x\)

4. **According to the problem, after giving money to their sister, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money:**
   \[
   15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15

"Given that the mural uses 12 pints of paint in total and that half of the mural is yellow, we can determine the amount of yellow paint used:

\[ \text{Amount of yellow paint} = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Since the mural has equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, and the total amount of paint used for these three colors is the remaining half of the mural:

\[ \text{Total amount of red, white, and purple paint} = 12 - 6 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we divide the total amount of these three colors by 3:

\[ \text{Amount of red paint} = \frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, the number of pints of red paint used is:

2 pints"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is:

\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total area of the house is:

3. **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the puffs from all five days:
\[3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93\]

So, at the end of the week, Alice will have counted a total of 93 cloud puffs."
"First, let's determine the number of pods in the special size box. The regular box contains 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods. 

To find 20% of 100:
\[ 100 \times 0.20 = 20 \]

So, the special size box contains:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. To find the cost per pod in the special size box:
\[ \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

If you have $1, you can buy:
\[ \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \text{ pods} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Withdrawal**: Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills.
   - Since each bill is $20, the number of 20 dollar bills he withdraws is \( \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \) bills.

2. **Losing Bills**: Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   - Remaining bills: \( 50 - 10 = 40 \) bills.

3. **Using Half for a Bill**: He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   - Half of 40 bills is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) bills.
   - Cost of the bill: \( 20 \times 20 = 400 \) dollars.

4. **Tripling the Money**: After paying for the bill, he triples the remaining money.
   - Remaining money after paying for the bill: \( 1000 - 400 = 600 \) dollars.
   - Tripling the money: \( 600 \times 3 = 1800 \) dollars.

5. **Converting to 5 Dollar Bills**: He converts all his money to 5 dollar bills.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the length of the chalk after Monday.
2. Calculate how much chalk is used each day.
3. Determine how many days the chalk will last before it needs to be recycled.

**Step 1: Determine the length of the chalk after Monday.**

The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk and used 45% of it on Monday. Therefore, the remaining chalk is:
\[ 5 \times (1 - 0.45) = 5 \times 0.55 = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]

**Step 2: Calculate how much chalk is used each day.**

The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. So, the amount of chalk used each day is:
\[ 0.20 \times \text{current length of chalk} \]

**Step 3: Determine how many days the chalk will last before it needs to be recycled.**

The teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. We need to find out how many days it takes for the chalk to go from 2.75 inches to less than 2 inches, using 20% of the chalk each day.

Let's denote the length of the chalk after \( n \) days as \( L_n \). We start with \( L_0 = 2.75 \) inches. Each day, the length of the chalk is reduced by 20%, so:
\[ L_{n+1} = L_n \times 0.80 \]

We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( L_n < 2 \) inches.

Let's calculate the length of the chalk each day until it falls below 2 inches:

- Day 1: \( L_1 = 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \) inches
- Day 2: \( L_2 = 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \) inches

Since \( L_2 = 1.76 \) inches is less than 2 inches, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk by the end of the second day.

Therefore, the number of days before the teacher has to recycle the piece of chalk is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"

1. **Determine the number of teeth drilled:**
   - The dentist drills 4 teeth.

2. **Determine the number of teeth capped:**
   - The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills.
   - Therefore, the number of teeth capped = 4 (drilled) + 7 = 11 teeth.

3. **Calculate the total number of teeth fixed:**
   - Teeth fixed = Teeth drilled + Teeth capped = 4 + 11 = 15 teeth.

4. **Calculate the percentage of teeth fixed:**
   - Total teeth = 30
   - Teeth fixed = 15
   - Percentage of teeth fixed = (Teeth fixed / Total teeth) * 100

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of \(\boxed{5600}\)."
"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 5(C + 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7) \]

Next, we'll solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}C + \frac{35}{3} \]
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books he can buy per school.

First, we find out how many books Bob can buy with $27000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. Therefore, the number of books he can buy per dollar is:

\[ \frac{100 \text{ books}}{500 \text{ dollars}} = 0.2 \text{ books per dollar} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of books he can buy with $27000:

\[ 27000 \text{ dollars} \times 0.2 \text{ books per dollar} = 5400 \text{ books} \]

Next, we divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books he can buy per school:

\[ \frac{5400 \text{ books}}{3 \text{ schools}} = 1800 \text{ books per school} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1800 \text{ books per school} \]"
"Let's break down the sequence of events to determine how many apples Newton brought home.

1. Initially, two apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other one into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out.
   - Apples in Newton's pocket: 1
   - Apples on the ground: 5
3. Newton picked up the 5 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out.
   - Apples in Newton's pocket: 1 (initial) + 4 (picked up) = 5
   - Apples on the ground: 6

Now, Newton picked up all of the remaining apples and went home.

- Total apples in Newton's pocket: 5 (from the first set) + 6 (from the second set) = 11

Therefore, the total number of apples Newton brought home is 11."
"To find the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of 50 kg bags needed for 850 kg of coal.
2. Multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag.

Step 1: Calculate the number of 50 kg bags needed.
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total cost.
\[ \text{Total cost} = 17 \text{ bags} \times \$18/\text{bag} = \$306 \]

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's order is $306."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices and pepperoni pizza slices that Kate's friends will eat.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

So, for 6 friends, the total number of slices eaten will be:
- Cheese pizza slices: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices}\)
- Pepperoni pizza slices: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices}\)

Now, we need to determine how many whole cheese and pepperoni pizzas are required to provide these slices.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- Therefore, the number of cheese pizzas needed is \( \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \).

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- Therefore, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is \( \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \).

Adding the number of cheese and pepperoni pizzas together, Kate needs to buy:
- \(3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas}\).

Final numerical answer:

"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran each day.

- On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So for these three days, the total is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) miles.
- On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So for these two days, the total is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) miles.

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days together:

\(9 + 10 = 19\)

So, Sam ran a total of 19 miles this week."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Snowballs Built Per Hour**: Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour.

2. **Snowballs Melted Per 15 Minutes**: 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 fifteen-minute intervals in an hour, the net loss of snowballs per hour is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) snowballs.

3. **Net Gain of Snowballs Per Hour**: Therefore, the net gain of snowballs per hour is \(20 - 8 = 12\) snowballs.

4. **Target Number of Snowballs**: Jay wants to have 60 snowballs.

5. **Time Calculation**: To find out how many hours it will take to get 60 snowballs, we divide the target number of snowballs by the net gain per hour:
   \[
   \text{Time (in hours)} = \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Jim's age at the time Digimon came out and then find out how old he is now.

1. First, we need to find out how many years ago Digimon came out. Since John is 28 now and he was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out, we can set up the following relationship:

Let \( J \) be Jim's age when Digimon came out, and \( 2J \) be John's age at that time. The difference in their ages is constant, so if John is currently 28, and he was \( 2J \) years old when Digimon came out, the number of years since then is \( 28 - 2J \).

2. Since John was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 - (28 - 2J) = 2J - J \]
\[ 28 - 28 + 2J = J \]
\[ 2J = J + (28 - 2J) \]
\[ 2J = J + 28 - 2J \]
\[ J = 28 - J \]
\[ 2J = 28 - J \]
\[ 3J = 28 \]
\[ J = \frac{28}{3} \]
\[ J = 8 \]

So, Jim was 8 years old when Digimon came out.

3. Now, to find out how old Jim is now, we need to add the number of years since Digimon came out to Jim's age at that time. Since John is 28 now and he was 2J (which is 16) when Digimon came out, the number of years since then is:
\[ 28 - 16 = 12 \]

Therefore, Jim's current age is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

Jim is 20 years old now."
"Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find the total number of slices they all ate, we add the slices each person ate:
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

They all ate a total of 6 slices of apple."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 1 bulk pack = 50
   - Bandages at the end of the first day: \(38 + 50 - 38 = 50\)

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: \(38 - 10 = 28\)
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \(50 + 50 - 28 = 72\)

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages ordered: 2 bulk packs = \(2 \times 50 = 100\)
   - Bandages used: \(50 / 2 = 25\)
   - Bandages at the end of the third day: \(72 + 100 - 25 = 147\)

However, the problem states that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means we need to adjust our initial count to match this condition.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as \(x\).

- After the first day: \(x + 50 - 38 = x + 12\)
- After the second day: \((x + 12) + 50 - 28 = x + 34\)
- After the third day: \((x + 34) + 100 - 25 = x + 109\)

We know that at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left, so:
\[x + 109 = 78\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[x = 78 - 109 = -31\]

This negative value doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, indicating a miscalculation. Let's recheck the steps:

- After the first day: \(x + 50 - 38 = x + 12\)
- After the second day: \((x + 12) + 50 - 28 = x + 34\)
- After the third day: \((x + 34) + 100 - 25 = x + 109\)

Given the final count is 78, we should have:
\[x + 109 = 78\]
\[x = 78 - 109 = -31\]

Rechecking the problem, the correct calculation should be:
\[x + 109 = 78\]
\[x = 78 - 109 = -31\]

The correct initial number of bandages is:
\[x = 78 - 109 = -31\]

This indicates a need to re-evaluate the problem setup. The correct initial number of bandages should be:

"To determine the total cost of May's hair cut and color, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut and the cost of the color separately, and then add them together.

1. **Cost of the color**: The cost for the color is a flat rate of $40.

2. **Cost of the haircut**: The cost per inch of haircut is $30. May's hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, which means her hair was cut by 2 inches. Therefore, the cost of the haircut is \(2 \text{ inches} \times \$30/\text{inch} = \$60\).

3. **Total cost**: Adding the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut gives us \( \$40 + \$60 = \$100 \).

So, the total cost of May's cut and color is **$100**."
"To calculate Jen's earnings for April, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Jen works in April.
2. Calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate.
3. Add the additional $10 for complete attendance.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Jen works in April.**

Jen works 7.5 hours a day and 6 days a week. There are 4 weeks in April.

Total hours in April = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks
Total hours in April = 180 hours

**Step 2: Calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate.**

Jen's hourly rate is $1.5.

Earnings from hours worked = 180 hours * $1.5/hour
Earnings from hours worked = $270

**Step 3: Add the additional $10 for complete attendance.**

Total earnings = Earnings from hours worked + Additional amount for complete attendance
Total earnings = $270 + $10
Total earnings = $280

**Final numerical answer:**
$280"
"To calculate how much money Jason earned, we need to multiply the number of times he performed each task by the amount he earns for that task and then sum these amounts.

1. For emptying the dishwasher: $0.50 per time, and he did it 6 times.
   \[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]

2. For doing his laundry: $3.00 per time, and he did it once.
   \[ 1 \times 3.00 = 3.00 \]

3. For taking the trash to the curb: $0.75 per time, and he did it twice.
   \[ 2 \times 0.75 = 1.50 \]

4. For cleaning his room: $1.50 per time, and he did it once.
   \[ 1 \times 1.50 = 1.50 \]

Now, we add all these amounts together to find the total amount Jason earned:
\[ 3.00 + 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 = 9.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 9.00 \]"
"Each whale has 40 gallons of blood. A shark has three times as much blood as a whale, so a shark has:

\[ 40 \text{ gallons} \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

If we have ten sharks, the total amount of blood for ten sharks would be:

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

1200 gallons"
"To calculate the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up the number of people who entered at different times.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we add all these numbers together:

\[50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320\]

Therefore, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack contains 5 pens, the total number of red pens is:

\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

She bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. Therefore, the number of black pens is:

\[ 2 \times 25 \text{ red pens} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

To find the total number of pens, we add the number of red pens and black pens together:

\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

Alain has 75 pens."
"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so:

\[ \text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + (0.5 \times 60) = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 20 bottles of cognac:

\[ \text{Total cost for cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount spent:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2400} \]"

- 10 more White Oak trees than the first day, which is \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees
- \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days:
- Total White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\)
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: \(40 + 50 = 90\)

Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:
\[50 + 90 = 140\]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Fred initially made 24 gallons of root beer.
2. His children drank 4 gallons, leaving 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.
3. His wife spilled 7 gallons, leaving 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.
4. His friend Ronnie took 5 gallons, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people (including Fred) showed up for the party. The remaining root beer is 8 gallons, which will be shared equally among the 3 people.

To find out how much each person gets, we divide the remaining root beer by the number of people:

8 gallons / 3 people = 8/3 gallons per person

So, each person gets 8/3 gallons of root beer, which is approximately 2.67 gallons.

The final numerical answer is:
8/3 gallons or approximately 2.67 gallons per person."
"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \( 8 \).

The final numerical answer is:
8"
"First, let's find out how many fish have red stripes. One-third of the 66 fish have red stripes:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after removing the fish with red stripes:

\[ 66 - 22 = 44 \]

Now, we know that 5/11 of the remaining 44 fish have blue stripes:

\[ \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \]

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

To find the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[ 22 + 20 = 42 \]

Therefore, the total number of fish that have red stripes and blue stripes is 42."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Eyeshadow Colors:**
   - Amy had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
   - Amy had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.
   - Total initial eyeshadow colors: \(8 + 18 = 26\) colors.

2. **After Her Sister Steals One Palette:**
   - Amy loses 4 colors from the stolen palette: \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors.

3. **Amy Uses Up Half of the Colors from One Makeup Set:**
   - One makeup set has 6 colors, and she uses up half: \(\frac{6}{2} = 3\) colors.
   - After using up 3 colors, the remaining colors from that set are: \(6 - 3 = 3\) colors.
   - The total remaining eyeshadow colors are: \(22 - 3 + 3 = 22\) colors.

So, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is **22**."
"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the height of Mattison's house.
2. Determine the height of the first floor.
3. Subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house to find the height of the second floor and the roof.

Step 1: The height of Mattison's house is 7 times his height.
\[ \text{Height of the house} = 7 \times 60 \text{ inches} = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Step 2: The height of the first floor is 3 times Mattison's height.
\[ \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times 60 \text{ inches} = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Step 3: Subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house to find the height of the second floor and the roof.
\[ \text{Height of the roof from the second floor's floor} = 420 \text{ inches} - 180 \text{ inches} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches."
"First, let's calculate how many shells team Alphas found. Since they found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ 700 \times 0.40 = 280 \]

This means team Alphas found 280 shells. Now, we need to find out how many shells were left for the other two teams:

\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ 420 \times 0.60 = 252 \]

So, team The finders found 252 shells. To find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells:

\[ 420 - 252 = 168 \]

Therefore, team Gogetters found 168 shells. 

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

First, let's calculate the total miles walked by the first three dogs:
- The first dog walks 1 mile.
- The second dog walks 4 miles.
- The third dog walks 3 miles.

Total miles for the first three dogs = 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

Since the average miles walked per day by the four dogs is 3 miles, the total miles walked by all four dogs per day is:
4 dogs * 3 miles/dog = 12 miles.

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs:
12 miles (total for all dogs) - 8 miles (total for the first three dogs) = 4 miles.

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day.

4 miles"
"First, we calculate the amount of the loan John gets by taking 40% of his home's value:

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, we determine how much of the loan he uses to pay off his debts by taking 60% of the loan amount:

\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Finally, we subtract the amount used to pay debts from the total loan amount to find out how much money he has leftover:

\[ \text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the amount of money John had leftover after paying his debts is:

\[ 40,000 \]"
"To find out how much Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught. 

The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms, the second tuna weighs 46 kilograms, and the last tuna weighs 26 kilograms. Adding these weights together:

\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings from selling 128 kilograms of tuna at a rate of $0.50 per kilogram:

\[ 128 \times 0.50 = 64 \]

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To calculate Trinity's profit, we first need to determine the selling price of the magazines. She sells them at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. Given that she bought the magazines at $72, we can calculate the selling price as follows:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times 1.375 \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the buying price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed = 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much as the low setting, so it removes 2 liters per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed = 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.

3. **High Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much as the medium setting, so it removes 4 liters per day.
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed = 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Now, we sum the water removed at each setting:
- Total water removed = 3 liters (low) + 6 liters (medium) + 20 liters (high) = 29 liters.

Therefore, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."

Therefore, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is 448 mL."
"First, we determine the capacity of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, we calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[ \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:

\[ \text{Total capacity of John's school} = 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ students} \]

The capacity of Ali's school is given as 120 students. Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is:

\[ \text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students} \]

The combined capacity of both schools is 150 students."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen will owe his sister including the 2% interest.

The principal amount Stephen borrowed is $300. The interest is 2% of $300, which is calculated as follows:
\[ 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen will owe is:
\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in 11 months is:
\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he has already paid from the total amount he owes:
\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the jar.
2. Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans, considering the packing efficiency.
3. Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.
4. Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans.
5. Compare Tim's guess to the true number of red jelly beans.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.**

The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall. The volume \( V \) of the jar is:
\[ V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans.**

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume \( V_{\text{eff}} \) is:
\[ V_{\text{eff}} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 3: Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.**

Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches. The total number of jelly beans \( N \) that can fit in the jar is:
\[ N = \frac{V_{\text{eff}}}{\text{volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans.**

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red. Therefore, the estimated number of red jelly beans \( N_{\text{red}} \) is:
\[ N_{\text{red}} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

**Step 5: Compare Tim's guess to the true number of red jelly beans.**

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between Tim's guess and the true number is:
\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

**Final Answer:**
Tim was 36 red jelly beans off."

4. **Total number of people on the bus after the second stop**: \( 20 + 40 + 30 = 90 \)
5. **People entering at the third stop**: The number of passengers on the bus doubled, so \( 90 \times 2 = 180 \)

Now, we need to find out how many more people are needed to fill the bus to its capacity of 200 people.

6. **Remaining spaces on the bus**: \( 200 - 180 = 20 \)

Therefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is **20**."
"First, let's calculate the cost of one visit after the increase. The original cost of one visit is $2. An increase of 150% means the cost increases by 1.5 times the original cost.

\[ \text{Increase} = 2 \times 1.5 = 3 \]

So, the new cost of one visit is:

\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \]

Pauline visits the museum three times a year. For the first 5 years, the cost per visit is $2. Therefore, the cost per year for 5 years is:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

So, for 5 years, the total cost is:

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \]

For the next 3 years, the cost per visit is $5. Therefore, the cost per year for 3 years is:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

So, for 3 years, the total cost is:

\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

Adding the costs for the 5 years and the 3 years gives the total amount Pauline spent:

\[ 30 + 45 = 75 \]

Therefore, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is:

\[ 75 \]"
"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students who can try the escape room.
2. Determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed.
3. Calculate the total time required for all groups to try the escape room.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of students who can try the escape room.**

There are 10 students in each of the 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th) who can try the escape room. Therefore, the total number of students is:
\[ 10 \text{ students/grade} \times 4 \text{ grades} = 40 \text{ students} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed.**

To find out how many groups of 8 students can be formed from 40 students, we divide the total number of students by the group size:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students/group}} = 5 \text{ groups} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total time required for all groups to try the escape room.**

Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room. Since there are 5 groups, the total time required is:
\[ 5 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 225 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take \(\boxed{225}\) minutes for everyone to try the escape room."

2. The cost of the roof frames:
   - John made 2 roof frames.
   - Each roof frame costs $10.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the roof frames is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.

3. Adding the costs together:
   - Total cost for tables: $80
   - Total cost for roof frames: $20
   - Therefore, the total amount Ali has to pay John is \(80 + 20 = 100\) dollars.

Ali has to pay John $100."
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we calculate its length as:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine how much of the secret steakhouse seasoning Aiden will need, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of ground beef needed:**
   - Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef.
   - He wants to make 80 meatballs.
   - Therefore, the amount of ground beef needed is \( \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds of ground beef} \).

2. **Calculate the amount of secret seasoning needed:**
   - Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for every pound of ground beef.
   - Since he needs 5 pounds of ground beef, the amount of secret seasoning needed is \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \).

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly makes as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be written as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

The total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is the sum of the number of cupcakes and brownies:
\[ C + B \]

Each of the five people in the class gets two treats, so the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]

Adding 2 to both sides:
\[ 4C = 12 \]

Dividing both sides by 4:
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To calculate the total cost for Karen, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted cost for the manicure and pedicure.
2. Calculate the cost for the nail art.
3. Add the costs together.

### Step 1: Calculate the discounted cost for the manicure and pedicure
- The original cost for a manicure is $35.
- The original cost for a pedicure is $40.
- The discount is 20%, so the discount amount for each service is 20% of the original cost.

Discount for manicure: \( 35 \times 0.20 = 7 \)
Discounted cost for manicure: \( 35 - 7 = 28 \)

Discount for pedicure: \( 40 \times 0.20 = 8 \)
Discounted cost for pedicure: \( 40 - 8 = 32 \)

Total discounted cost for both services: \( 28 + 32 = 60 \)

### Step 2: Calculate the cost for the nail art
- Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, which means 10 nails (5 on each hand).
- The cost for nail art per nail is $3.

Total cost for nail art: \( 10 \times 3 = 30 \)

### Step 3: Add the costs together
Total cost: \( 60 + 30 = 90 \)

Therefore, Karen would pay a total of $90."
"To find out how many magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the total number of issues from each magazine and then sum them up.

1. For the 3 magazines that each send 12 issues a year:
   \[3 \times 12 = 36\] issues.

2. For the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
   \[6\] issues.

3. For the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
   \[4 \times 6 = 24\] issues.

Now, we sum up all the issues:
\[36 + 6 + 24 = 66\] issues.

So, Susan gets a total of 66 issues every year. However, the question asks for the number of magazines, not the number of issues. We need to count the number of magazines:

- 3 magazines with 12 issues each
- 1 magazine with 6 issues
- 1 magazine with 24 issues

So, the total number of magazines is:
\[3 + 1 + 1 = 5\]

Final numerical answer:
\[

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that Samantha has 27 paintings.
2. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. So, if we add 12 to Samantha's paintings, we get the number of paintings Shelley has:
   \[
   \text{Shelley's paintings} = 27 + 12 = 39
   \]
3. Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. So, to find out how many paintings Kim has, we subtract 8 from the number of paintings Shelley has:
   \[
   \text{Kim's paintings} = 39 - 8 = 31
   \]

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings."
"To find the final price of the toy after the changes in November, December, and January, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the price in December after an 80% increase:**
   - The original price in November is $40.
   - An 80% increase means the price is increased by 80% of $40.
   - 80% of $40 is \( 0.80 \times 40 = 32 \).
   - Therefore, the new price in December is \( 40 + 32 = 72 \).

2. **Calculate the price in January after a 50% decrease:**
   - The price in December is $72.
   - A 50% decrease means the price is reduced by 50% of $72.
   - 50% of $72 is \( 0.50 \times 72 = 36 \).
   - Therefore, the new price in January is \( 72 - 36 = 36 \).

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"First, let's calculate the amount Charlie makes from the 4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour.

\[ 4 \text{ lessons} \times \$80 \text{ per lesson} = \$320 \]

Next, we need to determine the reduced rate for lessons with a veteran. Since the rate is reduced by 25%, we calculate 25% of $80 and subtract it from the standard rate.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$80 = 0.25 \times \$80 = \$20 \]

So, the reduced rate is:

\[ \$80 - \$20 = \$60 \]

Now, we calculate the amount Charlie makes from the 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran at the reduced rate.

\[ 2 \text{ lessons} \times \$60 \text{ per lesson} = \$120 \]

Finally, we add the amounts from both types of lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make for the day.

\[ \$320 + \$120 = \$440 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is:

\[ \$440 \]"

So, Eve is left with 5 pomelos.

To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number:
\[
20 - 5 = 15
\]

Eve gave away 15 pomelos."
"First, let's calculate how many apples Walter ate. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 apples:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, let's find out how many apples he had left after eating:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Next, Walter gave 25% of the remaining apples to his sister. To find out how many apples that is, we calculate 25% of 36:

\[ 0.25 \times 36 = 9 \]

So, Walter gave 9 apples to his sister. Now, let's find out how many apples he had left after giving some to his sister:

\[ 36 - 9 = 27 \]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple:

\[ 27 \times 3 = 81 \]

Therefore, Walter received $81."
"To find out how many novels Regina has written this year, we can set up the problem as follows:

Let \( x \) be the number of novels Regina has written this year.

According to the problem, 9 novels are 3 quarters (or \(\frac{3}{4}\)) of the number of novels she has written this year. This can be written as:
\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4}x \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \(\frac{4}{3}\):
\[ x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]
\[ x = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

"To determine the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we first need to calculate the total distance he has traveled over the 3 days.

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. If he travels at this speed for 24 hours a day (assuming he doesn't stop for any other reason than the necessary stops), the distance he covers in one day is:

\[ 50 \, \text{km/hr} \times 24 \, \text{hr/day} = 1200 \, \text{km/day} \]

Over 3 days, the total distance he covers is:

\[ 1200 \, \text{km/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3600 \, \text{km} \]

The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of this distance that Michael has covered, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance covered}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{3600 \, \text{km}}{6000 \, \text{km}} \right) \times 100 = 0.6 \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas."
"First, let's calculate the number of grapes Madeline's brother used to make the grape juice. Since he used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, and Madeline ate 6 grapes, we have:

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many grapes were used to make the pies. Since each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes and their mother made 4 pies, the total number of grapes used for the pies is:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

Now, we can find the total number of grapes used by adding the grapes used for the grape juice and the grapes used for the pies:

\[ 30 + 48 = 78 \text{ grapes} \]

Since these 78 grapes represent the total number of grapes used, and we are asked for the number of grapes at the beginning, the answer is:

\[ 78 \]

Therefore, the number of grapes at the beginning was 78."
"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the number of substitute teachers.

Total number of teachers: 82
Number of sick teachers: 13
Number of substitute teachers: 9

Teachers at school = Total number of teachers - Number of sick teachers + Number of substitute teachers
Teachers at school = 82 - 13 + 9
Teachers at school = 69 + 9
Teachers at school = 78

So, the final numerical answer is:
78"
"To calculate how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, let's break down the costs first:

1. **Pasta cost per week**: $1.00
2. **Cheddar cheese cost per week**: $3.00
3. **Gruyere cheese cost per week**: Twice the cheddar cheese cost, which is $3.00 * 2 = $6.00

Now, let's add up the weekly costs:
- Total weekly cost = Pasta cost + Cheddar cheese cost + Gruyere cheese cost
- Total weekly cost = $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, we need to find out how much he spends in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:
- Annual cost = Total weekly cost * 52
- Annual cost = $10.00 * 52 = $520.00

Therefore, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year."
"To determine the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.
2. Determine the total available time over the 5 days.
3. Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.
4. Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.**

Each classroom takes 15 minutes to clean, so for 80 classrooms:
\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total available time over the 5 days.**

An 8-hour day is equivalent to:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Over 5 days, the total available time is:
\[ 480 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 2400 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.**

The total time required to clean all classrooms is 1200 minutes, and this needs to be done over 5 days, so the average time spent cleaning per day is:
\[ \frac{1200 \text{ minutes}}{5 \text{ days}} = 240 \text{ minutes/day} \]

**Step 4: Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.**

The percentage of the day spent cleaning is calculated as:
\[ \left( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{480 \text{ minutes}} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

Therefore, the custodian spends 50% of their day, on average, cleaning classrooms."
"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:

- The middle 2 shelves together can hold \(10 + 10 = 20\) books.
- Adding the bottom and top shelves, the total capacity of one bookcase is \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's determine how many eggs Rose has in total. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many sets of 3 eggs she can sell from 60 eggs:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since she sells each set of 3 eggs for $1, her total revenue from selling all the eggs is:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Rose's profit is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Skyler has a total of 100 hats.
2. Half of the hats are red, so the number of red hats is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \) hats.
3. After removing the red hats, the remaining number of hats is \( 100 - 50 = 50 \) hats.
4. \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining hats are blue, so the number of blue hats is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \) hats.
5. The rest of the hats are white. So, the number of white hats is the remaining hats after accounting for the red and blue ones, which is \( 50 - 30 = 20 \) hats.

Therefore, Skyler has 20 white hats."
"To find the cost per stick of jerky in cents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the discounted price of the bag.
2. Calculate the total cost per stick.
3. Convert the cost per stick to cents.

Step 1: The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount. So, the discounted price is:
\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 2: The bag contains 30 sticks of jerky. So, the cost per stick in dollars is:
\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \text{ dollars per stick} \]

Step 3: Convert the cost per stick to cents. Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, the cost per stick in cents is:
\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost per stick of jerky is 50 cents."
"First, let's calculate the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass. She needs to get 70% of the total questions correct. The total number of questions across both tests is 70 + 40 = 110 questions. Therefore, she needs to answer 70% of 110 questions correctly:

\[ 0.70 \times 110 = 77 \]

So, Audrey needs to answer 77 questions correctly to pass.

Next, we calculate how many questions Audrey answered correctly on the first test. She got 60% of the 70 questions correct:

\[ 0.60 \times 70 = 42 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more questions she needs to get correct on the second test to reach the total of 77 correct answers. We subtract the number of correct answers from the first test from the total number of correct answers needed:

\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. So, we can write:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying this, we get:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \( 96 \)."

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using, we need to calculate the number of each item separately and then add them together.

1. **Flashlights:**
   - There are 4 people in the family, so there are 4 flashlights for the people.
   - There are 8 rooms, and for each room, there are 2 flashlights. So, \(8 \times 2 = 16\) flashlights for the rooms.
   - In total, the number of flashlights is \(4 + 16 = 20\).

2. **Candles:**
   - Half of the 8 rooms have 4 small candles each. So, \(8 / 2 = 4\) rooms have 4 small candles each, which totals \(4 \times 4 = 16\) small candles.
   - The other half of the 8 rooms have 5 medium candles each. So, \(4\) rooms have 5 medium candles each, which totals \(4 \times 5 = 20\) medium candles.
   - In total, the number of candles is \(16 + 20 = 36\).

Adding the flashlights and candles together:
- Total items = 20 flashlights + 36 candles = 56 items.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Mitchell buys two bags of chips, with each bag containing 55 chips. Therefore, the total number of chips is:

\[ 2 \times 55 = 110 \]

His family has five members, and if they all get the same number of chips, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members:

\[ \frac{110}{5} = 22 \]

Each person gets 22 chips."
"To solve this problem, let's break down the time taken for each side of the Rubik's cube:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice the time of the first side, so each of these takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. The last two sides each take half the time of the first side, so each of these takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.
4. The sixth side (which is the fifth side mentioned in the problem) is not specified, but since all sides are solved once the fifth side is done, we can assume it takes the same time as the first side, which is 5 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all six sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes
- Sixth side: 5 minutes

Total time = \(5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 5 = 35\) minutes.

The Rubik's cube takes 35 minutes to solve."
"Given that there were 20 helmets, we can determine the number of robots and footballs based on the information provided.

1. The number of robots is half the number of helmets. Since there are 20 helmets:
   \[
   \text{Number of robots} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]

2. The number of helmets is half the number of footballs. Since there are 20 helmets:
   \[
   \text{Number of footballs} = 20 \times 2 = 40
   \]

Now, to find the total number of items Dominick saw, we add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:
\[
\text{Total number of items} = \text{Number of robots} + \text{Number of helmets} + \text{Number of footballs} = 10 + 20 + 40 = 70
\]

Therefore, the total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"First, let's calculate how many minutes Tim spends at work each day answering phones. Since he spends 6 hours each day at work and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total minutes as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many calls he can handle in a day. Since it takes him 15 minutes to deal with each call, we divide the total minutes he spends at work each day by the time it takes to handle one call:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes/day}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 24 \text{ calls/day} \]

Now, to find out how many calls he deals with during his 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls he handles each day by the number of workdays in a week:

\[ 24 \text{ calls/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 120 \text{ calls/week} \]

Therefore, Tim deals with 120 calls during his 5-day work week."
"To find out how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings with the old varnish.
2. Calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings with the new varnish.
3. Subtract the total drying time with the old varnish from the total drying time with the new varnish.

Step 1: Total drying time with the old varnish
- Drying time for one painting = 7 minutes
- Number of paintings = 6
- Total drying time = 7 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 42 minutes

Step 2: Total drying time with the new varnish
- Drying time for one painting = 12 minutes
- Number of paintings = 6
- Total drying time = 12 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 72 minutes

Step 3: Difference in total drying time
- Difference = Total drying time with new varnish - Total drying time with old varnish
- Difference = 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes

Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish."
"To determine the total amount of water Crista needs for her plants every day, we can break down the problem into parts based on the different watering needs of the plants.

1. **Plants needing half a cup of water:**
   - There are 4 plants.
   - Each plant needs 0.5 cups of water.
   - Total water for these plants = 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups.

2. **Plants needing 1 cup of water:**
   - There are 8 plants.
   - Each plant needs 1 cup of water.
   - Total water for these plants = 8 * 1 = 8 cups.

3. **Plants needing a quarter of a cup of water:**
   - Crista has 20 plants in total.
   - 4 plants need half a cup, and 8 plants need 1 cup.
   - Therefore, the remaining plants = 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants.
   - Each of these plants needs 0.25 cups of water.
   - Total water for these plants = 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Adding up the total water needed for all the plants:
- Total water = 2 cups (for half a cup plants) + 8 cups (for 1 cup plants) + 2 cups (for quarter cup plants) = 12 cups.

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To return home, Phineas Frog needs to cover a total distance of 200 yards. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, he will cover 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop on land:
- Speed on land = 20 yards per minute
- Distance on land = 100 yards
- Time on land = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to swim in water:
- Speed in water = 10 yards per minute
- Distance in water = 100 yards
- Time in water = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Finally, we add the time spent on land and in water to find the total time:
- Total time = Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

Therefore, it will take Phineas Frog 15 minutes to return home."
"To determine the cost for Bob to build his project, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of boxes.

First, we know that Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks and each box contains 8 popsicle sticks. To find out how many boxes he needs, we divide the total number of popsicle sticks by the number of popsicle sticks per box:

\[ \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{56 \text{ popsicle sticks}}{8 \text{ popsicle sticks/box}} = 7 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we know that each box costs $2.00. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 7 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$14.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is:

\[ \$14.00 \]"
"The main phone plan costs $20, and it costs twice as much as each additional phone. Therefore, each additional phone costs $20 / 2 = $10.

Since there are five phones in total and one of them is the main phone, there are 4 additional phones. The cost for the additional phones is 4 * $10 = $40.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones, which is $20 + $40 = $60.

Therefore, the whole phone plan costs $60."
"To calculate how much money Derrick makes in June from selling all the doughnuts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of doughnuts made daily.
2. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts in June.

Step 1: Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since 1 dozen equals 12 doughnuts, he makes:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ doughnuts per day} \]

Step 2: June typically has 30 days. Therefore, the total number of doughnuts made in June is:
\[ 120 \times 30 = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

Step 3: Each doughnut is sold for $2. Thus, the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts in June is:
\[ 3600 \times 2 = 7200 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Derrick makes \(\boxed{7200}\) dollars in June if he sells all the doughnuts."

"First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed after training. His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster:

\[ 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of words John needs to speak. Each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages:

\[ 450 \, \text{words/page} \times 10 \, \text{pages} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we can calculate the time it would take for John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. The time is calculated by dividing the total number of words by his speaking speed:

\[ \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speed."
"On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day, so:
50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so:
2 * 70 = 140 people.

For the rest of the week (days 4, 5, 6, and 7), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Since there are 4 days, the total number of people he saw over these days is:
4 * 60 = 240 people.

Now, to find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we add the numbers from each day:
50 (first day) + 70 (second day) + 140 (third day) + 240 (remaining days) = 500 people.

Total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week:

"Let's break down the popping rates and calculate the total number of popped kernels.

1. **First 30 seconds:** 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds:** The popping rate is three times the initial rate, so \(20 \times 3 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Following 30 seconds:** The popping rate is four times the initial rate, so \(20 \times 4 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds:** The popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so \(80 \div 2 = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, we add up the popped kernels from the first four 30-second intervals:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\]

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop. So, a quarter of 40 kernels pop:
\[40 \div 4 = 10\]

Adding these to the total:
\[200 + 10 = 210\]

Therefore, Garrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to eat."
"To determine how many lemons Tim will need, let's break down the problem step by step.

   - Tim needs 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.
   - Allen asked for an extra gallon that is twice as tart, which means it will have the same amount of lemon juice as a regular gallon but will be more concentrated.
   - Therefore, Tim needs 4 gallons + 1 gallon = 5 gallons of lemonade in total.

2. **Determine the amount of lemon juice needed:**
   - For 1 gallon of lemonade, Tim needs 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.
   - For 5 gallons of lemonade, he will need 5 cups of lemon juice.

3. **Calculate the number of lemons needed:**
   - 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
   - To get 5 cups of juice, Tim will need 5 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 30 lemons.

Therefore, Tim will need 30 lemons."

Therefore, the total amount of dog food needed in a week is 147 kilograms."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we first calculate the total number of legs from both the 2-legged and 4-legged animals.

- The 10 2-legged animals contribute \(10 \times 2 = 20\) legs.
- The 15 4-legged animals contribute \(15 \times 4 = 60\) legs.

Adding these together, the total number of legs is \(20 + 60 = 80\).

Since a pair consists of 2 legs, the total number of pairs of legs is \(80 \div 2 = 40\).

Therefore, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 40."
"Let's break down the information given:

- There are 4 blue blocks.
- There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, so there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) yellow blocks.
- Let the number of red blocks be \(R\).

The total number of blocks in the tower is the sum of blue, yellow, and red blocks, which is given as 32. So, we can write the equation:

\[4 + 8 + R = 32\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[12 + R = 32\]

To find \(R\), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:

\[R = 32 - 12\]

\[R = 20\]

So, there are 20 red blocks in the tower.

"To find the number of pink candies, let's first determine the quantities of the other colored candies.

1. **Red Candies**: There are 54 red candies.
2. **Orange Candies**: There are twice as many orange candies as red candies, so:
   \[
   2 \times 54 = 108 \text{ orange candies}
   \]
3. **Yellow Candies**: There are half as many yellow candies as red candies, so:
   \[
   \frac{54}{2} = 27 \text{ yellow candies}
   \]

Now, let's sum up the candies of the known colors:
\[
54 \text{ (red)} + 108 \text{ (orange)} + 27 \text{ (yellow)} = 189 \text{ candies}
\]

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the sum of the known colored candies from the total:
\[
232 - 189 = 43

Therefore, the total amount they pay is **38 dollars**."
"First, we need to calculate the total weight of the car, luggage, and children. The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and each child weighs 75 pounds. Since there are two children, we add their weights together:

\[ 75 \text{ pounds/child} \times 2 \text{ children} = 150 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weight of the car, luggage, and children:

\[ 1200 \text{ pounds} + 250 \text{ pounds} + 150 \text{ pounds} = 1600 \text{ pounds} \]

The force required to move the car is 1% of its total weight. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we multiply 1600 by 0.01:

\[ 1600 \text{ pounds} \times 0.01 = 16 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the force John needs to push the car is:

\[ 16 \text{ pounds} \]"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the daily feed consumption for one pig:**
   Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day. So, the daily feed consumption for one pig is:
   \[
   4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the daily feed consumption for all five pigs:**
   Since Dexter has five pigs, the total daily feed consumption is:
   \[
   8 \text{ pounds/day/pig} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weekly feed consumption for all five pigs:**
   There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly feed consumption is:

Total cookies = 10 + 7 + 6 = 23

Randy has 23 cookies now."
"Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers. If he sells half of his collection at $5 per toy and the other half at $7 per toy, we can calculate the total amount he would earn as follows:

1. Half of 12 is 6, so he would sell 6 toys at $5 each and 6 toys at $7 each.
2. The earnings from the first 6 toys would be \(6 \times 5 = 30\) dollars.
3. The earnings from the other 6 toys would be \(6 \times 7 = 42\) dollars.
4. Adding these amounts together, the total earnings would be \(30 + 42 = 72\) dollars.

Therefore, if Matthew agrees to the offer, he would earn \(\boxed{72}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \, \text{holes/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 84 \, \text{holes} \]

When Nate gets home, he starts filling holes at a rate of 9 holes a day, but the dog continues to dig 6 new holes each night. This means that each day, the net change in the number of holes is:

\[ 9 \, \text{holes filled} - 6 \, \text{holes dug} = 3 \, \text{holes filled per day} \]

To find out how many days it takes to fill in all 84 holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled per day:

\[ \frac{84 \, \text{holes}}{3 \, \text{holes/day}} = 28 \, \text{days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} = 4 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes."
"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School, and Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 \]

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = 3000 \]

Now, to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract the average enrollment of Butler High School from that of Norman High School:

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 4000 - 3000 \]

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 1000 \]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School."
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made: 7995
Rainbow cookies: 2595
Oatmeal cookies: 3075

Now, subtract the rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total:

7995 - 2595 - 3075 = 2325

The Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which means Igor gathered \(16 / 2 = 8\) test tubes.
2. Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, which means Igor gathered \(14 + 2 = 16\) Petri dishes.
3. Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, but some were lost on the way, so let's denote the number of beakers Igor actually brought as \(x\).

The total number of items placed on the lab bench is 29. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[8 \text{ (test tubes)} + x \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[8 + x + 16 = 29\]

\[24 + x = 29\]

Subtract 24 from both sides:

\[x = 5\]

So, Igor brought 5 beakers to the lab bench. Since Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, the number of beakers Igor lost is:

\[7 - 5 = 2\]

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of legs for all tables:**
   - Each table has 4 legs.
   - James is putting together 4 tables.
   - Therefore, the total number of legs is \(4 \text{ legs/table} \times 4 \text{ tables} = 16 \text{ legs}\).

2. **Calculate the total number of screws needed:**
   - Each leg needs 2 screws.
   - Therefore, the total number of screws needed is \(16 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 32 \text{ screws}\).

3. **Calculate the number of screws left over:**
   - James has 40 screws.
   - He needs 32 screws.
   - Therefore, the number of screws left over is \(40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws}\).

**Final Answer:**
8 screws will be left over."
"There are 10 eggs in the first basket. The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first, so it has \(10 \times 2 = 20\) eggs. 

Adding the eggs from both baskets together: \(10 + 20 = 30\).

Therefore, there are 30 eggs in both baskets put together."
"First, let's determine how much each person raised:

- Alexandra raises $430.
- Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.
- Sarah raises $300.
- Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add up the amounts raised by all of them:

- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: $750
- Maryam: $700
- Sarah: $300

Total amount raised = $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180

Therefore, the total amount of money they all raised is $2180."
"First, let's determine the speed of Aaron and Vanessa.

Given that Vanessa ran 4 miles, and Aaron ran half as far as Vanessa, Aaron ran:
\[ \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \]

Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes. Therefore, Aaron's speed is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is:
\[ \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \times 2 = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles at her speed of \(\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}}\):
\[ 4 \text{ miles} \times 4 \text{ minutes per mile} = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To determine how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we first calculate the total amount of line required based on the length of the dock.

Given:
- The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.
- There is currently 200 feet of dock.

So, the total line required for the dock is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we account for the line he already has:
- He has 6 feet of new line.

Therefore, the amount of line he needs to buy is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

So, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To calculate how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of meals and wine per night.
2. Determine the total cost per night.
3. Calculate the total for the days the restaurant is open in a week.

First, let's calculate the cost per night:
- They order 2 meals at $5 each, so the cost for meals is \(2 \times 5 = \$10\).
- They also order a $5 bottle of wine.
- Therefore, the total cost per night is \(10 + 5 = \$15\).

Next, since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, we multiply the daily cost by 2:
- Total weekly cost = \(15 \times 2 = \$30\).

So, the restaurant makes \(\$30\) a week."
"First, let's calculate the cost price of each watermelon. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = \$1.60 \]

Next, we need to find the selling price per watermelon, given that the vendor made a profit of 25%. The profit percentage is calculated on the cost price, so the selling price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = \text{Cost price per watermelon} \times (1 + \text{Profit percentage}) \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times (1 + 0.25) \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 1.25 \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00."
"First, let's determine Dora's current age. If Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

James is currently twice as old as Dora, so James is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.

John had James when he was 19, so John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

John had his youngest son when he was 32, so his youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many oranges each person can peel in an hour and then find the difference.

First, let's determine how many oranges Ana can peel in an hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

Next, let's determine how many oranges Jane can peel in an hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- Ana peels 20 oranges.
- Jane peels 15 oranges.
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost is $400, and he gets it at 80% off, which means he pays 20% of the original cost.

\[ \text{Discounted cost of radiator} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

\[ \text{Cost of labor} = 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of labor to find the total amount Mark paid.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is $230."
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( C \) be the number of chickens.
- Let \( K \) be the number of cows.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( 2C + 4K = 70 \) (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To solve for \( C \) and \( K \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

Final numerical answer:
5"
"First, let's calculate the total number of pizza slices available. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide these slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. So, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices of pizza."
