"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and uses 4 for baking muffins for her friends. So, the total number of eggs used by Janet is:

3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for baking) = 7 eggs

The remainder of the eggs that she sells at the farmers' market is:

16 (total eggs) - 7 (used eggs) = 9 eggs

She sells each egg for $2, so the amount she makes from selling the eggs at the farmers' market every day is:

9 (eggs) * $2 (per egg) = $18

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."

"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The value increased by 150%, so we need to find 150% of the original purchase price and add it to the original purchase price.

The original purchase price is $80,000. 150% of $80,000 is calculated as follows:
\[ 150\% \times 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

Adding this to the original purchase price gives us the new value of the house:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost, which includes the purchase price and the repair cost:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, Josh made a profit of $70,000.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. He does this 3 times a week. 

First, calculate the total distance he runs in one session:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters

Then, calculate the total distance he runs in a week:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters

So, the total meters James runs a week is 540 meters."
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken consumes in a day.
2. Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon.
3. Subtract the morning and afternoon feed from the total daily feed requirement to find the final meal amount.

First, we know each chicken consumes 3 cups of feed per day. With 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we know the chickens are given 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, so the total for these two meals is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the morning and afternoon feed from the total daily requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens \(\boxed{20}\) cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of 16 glasses, considering that every second glass is 60% of the regular price.

1. The cost of the first glass is $5.
2. The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = $3\).

This pattern continues, so for every pair of glasses, the total cost is $5 (first glass) + $3 (second glass) = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide 16 by 2 to find out how many pairs of glasses he is buying: \(16 \div 2 = 8\) pairs.

Now, we multiply the cost of one pair by the number of pairs: \(8 \times 8 = $64\).

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

$64"
"Given that Seattle has 20 sheep, we can use the information provided to find out how many sheep Toulouse and Charleston have.

1. First, we know that Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So, we calculate the number of sheep in Charleston as follows:
   \[ \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times \text{Sheep in Seattle} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

2. Next, we know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, we calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse as follows:
   \[ \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 2 \times \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 2 \times 80 = 160 \]

3. Now, we add up the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle to find the total number of sheep:
   \[ \text{Total sheep} = \text{Sheep in Toulouse} + \text{Sheep in Charleston} + \text{Sheep in Seattle} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260 \]

Therefore, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have a total of 260 sheep together."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. Calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the file.
2. Add the time taken for the Windows update restart.
3. Calculate the time to download the remaining 60% of the file.
4. Sum up all the times to get the total download time.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Time to download 40% of the file:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \(0.40 \times 200 = 80\) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \(80 \div 2 = 40\) minutes.

2. **Time for the Windows update restart:**
   - This is given as 20 minutes.

3. **Time to download the remaining 60% of the file:**
   - 60% of 200 GB is \(0.60 \times 200 = 120\) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \(120 \div 2 = 60\) minutes.

4. **Total time:**
   - Total time = Time to download 40% + Time for Windows update restart + Time to download 60%
   - Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is 120 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance John has traveled and then determine how far he is from home at the end of the 4 hours.

1. **First Leg of the Trip:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John drives for 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered during this time.
   - Next, he drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - Finally, he drives for the remaining 1.5 hours (since he has 4 hours total and spent 2.5 hours so far) at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Traveled:**
   - Total distance = Distance of first leg + Distance of return trip = 180 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - Since John is driving back home, the total distance he has traveled (315 miles) is the distance from his current position to home.

Therefore, at the end of those 4 hours, John is 315 miles from home."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her work hours into regular and overtime hours, then apply the appropriate rates.

1. **Regular Hours**: Eliza works 40 hours at her regular rate of $10 per hour.
2. **Overtime Hours**: She worked 5 hours beyond the regular 40 hours, so these are considered overtime hours. Her overtime pay is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is $10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour.

Now, let's calculate her earnings:

- **Regular Earnings**: 40 hours * $10/hour = $400
- **Overtime Earnings**: 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Adding these together gives her total earnings for the week:

- **Total Earnings**: $400 + $60 = $460

**Eliza's earnings for this week are $460.**"
"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, which is:
\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \]

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, so the program had 70% of the second month's downloads:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

The program had a total of 366 downloads over the three months."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Each dozen costs $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Each dozen costs $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Each dozen costs $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330.

Now, we add up the total costs for each type of pastry to get the overall total cost:

- Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit becomes positive.

First, let's break down the costs and revenues:

1. **Initial Cost**: $90 (cost to plant the tree)
2. **Annual Costs**: $3 (water and feed the tree)
3. **Annual Revenue**: 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5

Now, let's calculate the net profit each year after the initial cost:

- **Net Profit per Year**: $10.5 (revenue) - $3 (cost) = $7.5

To find out how many years it will take to recover the initial cost of $90, we divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:

- **Years to Recover Initial Cost**: $90 / $7.5 = 12 years

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

**12 years**"
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there. This leaves her with \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners.

4. According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left after these sales. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

5. To solve for \( x \), first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]

6. Add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]

7. Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 2x = 36 \]

8. Finally, divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we have:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after the contemporary dance enrollment:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Now, 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

So, the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is the remaining students after accounting for contemporary and jazz dance:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the following calculation:

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100\% = 0.60 \times 100\% = 60\% \]

Therefore, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the expected value of the profit from each purchase after the speculated market increase.

1. **Jewelry Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value after increase: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125
   - Profit: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

2. **Electronic Gadgets Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value after increase: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096
   - Profit: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits:
- Jewelry profit: $125
- Electronic gadgets profit: $96

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing the jewelry, which would yield a profit of $125.

**Final numerical answer:**

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her earnings from both her teaching and coaching jobs and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She earns $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
\[ 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} = 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- She earns $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
\[ 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours/week} = 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from coaching are:
\[ 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Finally, we sum up her annual earnings from both jobs to get her total annual salary:
\[ 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} + 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} = 57500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Her annual salary is:

2. Calculate the number of eggs she eats in one week.
3. Calculate the number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Claire eats 3 eggs every day.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she eats \(3 \times 7 = 21\) eggs.

Step 3: In 4 weeks, she eats \(21 \times 4 = 84\) eggs.

Step 4: Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert 84 eggs into dozens by dividing by 12. So, \(84 \div 12 = 7\).

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks."
"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time required to cover 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time already spent:**
   \[
   \text{Time spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Determine the remaining time to cover the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining time} = \text{Total time} - \text{Time spent} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}

"To find the original price of the book, we can use the relationship between the original price, the discount, and the final price. Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

Given that the book was bought for $19.50 after a 25% discount, this means that $19.50 is 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00."

1. Henry's first stop was after 20 miles.
2. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip. This means he stopped at the 60 - 15 = 45th mile.

Now, to find the distance between his first and second stops, we subtract the mile he stopped at first from the mile he stopped at second:

45 miles (second stop) - 20 miles (first stop) = 25 miles

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

25 miles"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. So, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( B - 5 \).

We are also given that one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much. Therefore, the cost of the second pair of heels is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

Since the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( B - 5 \), we can set up the equation:
\[ B - 5 = 99 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Therefore, the boots cost \( 104 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
104"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up the relationship between Darrell's and Allen's ages using the given ratio and total age.

Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total age of Darrell and Allen is given as 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have \(x\), we can find Allen's current age:

\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

Allen's age 10 years from now will be:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine the guesses of each friend.

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we add these guesses together and divide by the number of guesses (which is 3) to find the average.

\[ \text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average guess} = \frac{240}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average guess} = 80 \]

The average guess is 80."

2. Multiply the daily hours by the number of dogs.
3. Multiply the result by the number of days in a week.

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day, and John has 10 dogs. So, the daily hours spent are:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly hours spent are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

This gives us the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now, we can find the number of gold coins by substituting \( S \) back into the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

70"
"First, let's find out how many jewels Aaron has. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of Raymond's jewels would be 40 / 2 = 20 jewels. Aaron has 5 more than this, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Now, Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points that is, we calculate 25% of 4 points:

25% of 4 points = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 points + 1 point = 5 points.

To find the total points scored, we add the points from both halves of the game:

Total points = 4 points (first 20 minutes) + 5 points (second 20 minutes) = 9 points

Therefore, Mike scored a total of 9 points."
"Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Over 30 days, he will consume:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

The sale price is 4 yogurts for $5.00. To find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15. So, the total money from selling lego sets is:

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 8 video games he buys. Each video game costs $20, so the total cost for 8 video games is:

\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, John has $5 left. This means the money he spent on video games plus the $5 left equals the total money he had from selling the lego sets. We can confirm this by subtracting the money spent on video games from the total money he had:

\[ 195 - 160 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he has $5 left, this confirms the calculation is correct. The question asks how many lego sets he still has, but since he sold all 13 lego sets, the number of lego sets he still has is:

\[ 0 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 0 \]"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   - John runs 3 hours on the first day.
   - Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour.
   - Distance on the first day = \( 3v \) miles.

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   - He runs half as much on the other two days, so each of these days he runs \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.
   - Distance on each of these days = \( 1.5v \) miles.
   - Total distance on the other two days = \( 2 \times 1.5v = 3v \) miles.

3. **Total weekly distance:**
   - Total distance = Distance on the first day + Distance on the other two days
   - Total distance = \( 3v + 3v = 6v \) miles.
   - We know the total weekly distance is 60 miles, so \( 6v = 60 \).

4. **Solving for \( v \):**
   - \( v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \) miles per hour.

Therefore, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour."
"First, let's determine Dana's running and walking speeds based on her skipping speed.

Given:
- Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
- Her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed.

So, her running speed is:
\[ 3 \text{ mph} \times 2 = 6 \text{ mph} \]

Next, we know that her running speed is four times her walking speed. Therefore, her walking speed is:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ mph}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \]

Now, let's calculate the time she spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking in a six-hour period.

Time spent running:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Time spent walking:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the distance she covers while running and walking.

Distance running:
\[ 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Distance walking:
\[ 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances to find the total distance she can travel in six hours:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"If Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, then Ben's iPhone is 2 years old.

Since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, and Ben's iPhone is 2 years old, Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

Therefore, Brandon’s iPhone is 8 years old."
"When Polly is holding the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the gold javelin three times farther than her normal throwing distance. Her normal throwing distance is 400 feet. Therefore, when holding the gemstone, she can throw the javelin:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. Therefore, Polly can stand 1200 feet away from the dragon and still hit it with the gold javelin. Since 1200 feet is outside the dragon's reach, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} \]"
"First, we calculate the total number of pie pieces available initially. Since Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the initial total:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

26"
"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total calories in the bag of chips:**
   - Each serving has 250 calories.
   - There are 5 servings in a 300g bag.
   - Therefore, the total calories in the bag are \( 250 \times 5 = 1250 \) calories.

2. **Calculate the remaining calories you can consume:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume are \( 2000 - 1800 = 200 \) calories.

3. **Determine how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining calories:**
   - Since the 300g bag contains 1250 calories, the number of grams per calorie is \( \frac{300}{1250} = 0.24 \) grams per calorie.
   - With 200 calories remaining, the grams of chips you can eat are \( 200 \times 0.24 = 48 \) grams.

Therefore, you can eat 48 grams of chips."
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of candles made.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling the candles.
3. Calculate the total cost of supplies.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of candles made.
Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax. If he makes 20 candles, we can determine the amount of beeswax used:
\[ \text{Pounds of beeswax} = \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds} \]

Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling the candles.
Each candle is sold for $2.00, so for 20 candles:
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of supplies.
The cost for one pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00. For 2 pounds:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00 \]

Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.
\[ \text{Net Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:
\[ \$20.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

- On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
- On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[ 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \]

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
\[ 26 \times 4 = 104 \]

Therefore, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is 104."
"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of Post-it notes Candice had: 80.
2. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she used at work: 220.
3. Add the remaining Post-it notes to find out how many were in the package.

Let's do the math:

Initial Post-it notes: 80
Post-it notes used at work: 220
Remaining Post-it notes: 23

So, the equation to find the number of Post-it notes in the package is:

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = (80 + 23) - 220 \]

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = 103 - 220 \]

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = -117 \]

It seems there's a mistake in the calculation. The correct approach should be:

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = (80 + \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package}) - 220 = 23 \]

Rearranging the equation to solve for the number of Post-it notes in the package:

\[ 80 + \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} - 220 = 23 \]

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = 23 + 220 - 80 \]

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is 163."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\$200}{\$40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost of each red tie} = \$40 + 0.5 \times \$40 = \$40 + \$20 = \$60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times \$60 = \$600 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \$200 + \$600 = \$800 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$800 \]"
"To determine how many 6-inch pieces Tracy can obtain from a 4-foot piece of wire, we first need to convert the length of the wire into inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, a 4-foot piece of wire is:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we divide the total length of the wire in inches by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces Tracy can get:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ inches}}{6 \text{ inches/piece}} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.
- The building has 15 floors.
- Each floor contains 8 units.
- Therefore, the total number of units is \(15 \times 8 = 120\).

Step 2: Determine the number of occupied units.
- 3/4 of the building is occupied.
- Therefore, the number of occupied units is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90\).

Step 3: Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.
- The number of unoccupied units is \(120 - 90 = 30\).

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"First, let's calculate how many dozens of eggs Lloyd produces per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we calculate how much Lloyd makes per day by selling these dozens of eggs at $2 per dozen:

\[ 21 \text{ dozen} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$42 \]

To find out how much Lloyd makes in a week, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7):

\[ \$42 \times 7 = \$294 \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\$294\) per week from selling eggs."
"To solve this problem, we need to know the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. However, the distance is not provided in the question. Let's assume the distance from the starting point to the destination is \(D\) miles.

1. **Outbound Trip:**
   - Speed: 10 miles per hour
   - Time: 3 hours (from 1 PM to 4 PM)
   - Distance: \(D = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}\)

2. **Return Trip:**
   - Speed: 6 miles per hour
   - Distance: 30 miles (same as the outbound trip)
   - Time: \(\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{mph}} = 5 \, \text{hours}\)

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, the remaining weight he needs to remove is:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys he needs to remove to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds is:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys."
"To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day and then find the difference.

**Thursday:**
- Truck tires: 6 tires * $60 per tire = $360
- Car tires: 4 tires * $40 per tire = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

**Friday:**
- Truck tires: 0 tires * $60 per tire = $0
- Car tires: 12 tires * $40 per tire = $480
- Total revenue on Friday = $0 + $480 = $480

**Difference in revenue:**
- Revenue on Thursday - Revenue on Friday = $520 - $480 = $40

The mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday compared to Friday."
"The Doubtfire sisters initially have 7 kittens. Their mother informs them that their two house cats, Patchy and Trixie, have had kittens as well. 

Trixie has had 12 kittens. Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which means Patchy has had \(3 \times 7 = 21\) kittens.

Now, to find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family has, we add the kittens from the shelter to the kittens from the house cats:

\(7 + 12 + 21 = 40\)

The final numerical answer is:
40"

"To determine how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost of one trip to the movies and then see how many such trips he can afford with his $42.

The cost of one movie ticket is $7, and the cost of popcorn is $7. Therefore, the total cost for one trip to the movies is:
\[ 7 + 7 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many times Peter can afford this amount with his $42. We do this by dividing his total money by the cost of one trip:
\[ 42 \div 14 = 3 \]

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after the truck and driver are loaded.
2. Determine how many boxes can be added to the truck without exceeding this remaining weight capacity.

First, let's find the remaining weight capacity of the bridge. The bridge can carry a maximum of 5000 pounds, and the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Therefore, the remaining weight capacity is:

\[ 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many boxes can be added to the truck without exceeding this remaining weight capacity. Each box weighs 15 pounds. So, we divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box:

\[ \frac{1245}{15} = 83 \]

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is:

\[ \boxed{83} \]"

"Janet first spends $500 on the material and $800 on the jeweler to construct the brooch. The total cost for these items is:

\[ \$500 + \$800 = \$1300 \]

Next, she pays 10% of this total amount to get it insured. To find 10% of $1300, we calculate:

\[ 10\% \times \$1300 = 0.10 \times \$1300 = \$130 \]

Adding the insurance cost to the initial total cost gives:

\[ \$1300 + \$130 = \$1430 \]

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payments into two halves of the year.

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - The monthly charge is $140.
   - Total for the first half: \( 6 \times 140 = 840 \) dollars.

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - The charge is reduced by 10% for the second half of the year.
   - 10% of $140 is \( 0.10 \times 140 = 14 \) dollars.
   - The reduced monthly charge is \( 140 - 14 = 126 \) dollars.
   - There are 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - Total for the second half: \( 6 \times 126 = 756 \) dollars.

3. **Total Amount Paid:**

"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate her car's miles per gallon (mpg) efficiency. We know that Sophia has driven 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. 

First, we calculate the car's efficiency:
\[ \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{\text{Miles driven}}{\text{Gallons of gas used}} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ mpg} \]

Next, we use this efficiency to find out how far she can drive on a full tank of 12 gallons:
\[ \text{Distance on a full tank} = \text{Miles per gallon} \times \text{Gallons in the tank} = 25 \text{ mpg} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"First, let's break down the time Jim spends on TV and reading each time he does this activity:

1. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
2. He then reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is \(2 \div 2 = 1\) hour.

So, each time he does this, he spends a total of \(2 + 1 = 3\) hours on TV and reading.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent in a week is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

To find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:

\(9 \times 4 = 36\)

Therefore, Jim spends 36 hours on TV and reading in 4 weeks."
"To find the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to consider the number of players and coaches for both the girls' and boys' teams from each school.

1. Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players. So, for each school, the number of players is:
   \[5 \text{ players/team} \times 2 \text{ teams} = 10 \text{ players/school}\]

2. Each school also sends 2 coaches (one for the girls' team and one for the boys' team). So, for each school, the number of coaches is:
   \[2 \text{ coaches/school}\]

3. Since there are 4 schools, the total number of players from all schools is:
   \[10 \text{ players/school} \times 4 \text{ schools} = 40 \text{ players}\]

4. And the total number of coaches from all schools is:
   \[2 \text{ coaches/school} \times 4 \text{ schools} = 8 \text{ coaches}\]

5. Adding the total number of players and coaches together gives us the total number of people:
   \[40 \text{ players} + 8 \text{ coaches} = 48 \text{ people}\]

Therefore, the total number of people that all of the schools have sent is 48."
"To find the total number of gems in the chest, we need to calculate the number of each type of gem and then sum them up.

1. **Diamonds**: There are 175 diamonds.
2. **Rubies**: There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So, the number of rubies is \(175 - 35 = 140\).
3. **Emeralds**: There are twice the number of emeralds than the rubies. So, the number of emeralds is \(2 \times 140 = 280\).

Now, we sum up the number of each type of gem to get the total number of gems in the chest:
\[175 \text{ (diamonds)} + 140 \text{ (rubies)} + 280 \text{ (emeralds)} = 595\]

Therefore, the total number of gems in the chest is 595."
"First, let's determine the number of boys at Dr. Wertz's school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

Number of boys = 2 * Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 * 60
Number of boys = 120

Next, we need to find the total number of students at the school. This is the sum of the number of boys and the number of girls:

Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of students = 120 + 60
Total number of students = 180

Now, we know that there are 5 students for every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher:

Number of teachers = Total number of students / Number of students per teacher
Number of teachers = 180 / 5
Number of teachers = 36

Therefore, there are 36 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school."
"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to subtract the total amount of her allowance from her final total.

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so the total allowance is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. To find out how much she started with, we subtract the total allowance from her final total:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60."
"To calculate how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week.
2. Determine the total number of students she teaches in a week.
3. Calculate the total revenue based on the number of students and the charge per student.

First, let's calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week:

- She teaches 5 classes every weekday (Monday to Friday), so that's \(5 \times 5 = 25\) classes.
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.
- Therefore, the total number of classes in a week is \(25 + 8 = 33\).

Next, we calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week:

- Each class has 15 students.
- So, the total number of students in a week is \(33 \times 15 = 495\).

Finally, we calculate the total revenue:

- She charges $15.00 per student.
- Therefore, the total revenue is \(495 \times 15 = 7425\).

So, Judy makes $7425 in one week."
"The first recipe has 20 instructions.

The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, which means it has \(20 \times 2 = 40\) instructions.

"To calculate the total amount of money Tommy raises, we need to multiply the number of each item sold by its price and then add the totals together.

For brownies:
- Tommy sells 43 brownies at $3 per slice.
- Total from brownies = 43 slices * $3/slice = $129

For cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake at $4 per slice.
- Total from cheesecakes = 23 slices * $4/slice = $92

Now, we add the totals from both items:
- Total money raised = $129 (from brownies) + $92 (from cheesecakes) = $221

Therefore, Tommy raises a total of $221."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones without interest:

\[ \text{Total cost without interest} = 5 \times \$150 = \$750 \]

Next, we calculate the total interest for the 3-month installment. The interest rate is 2% per unit, and since there are five units, the total interest is:

\[ \text{Total interest} = 5 \times 2\% \times \$150 = 5 \times 0.02 \times \$150 = \$15 \]

So, the total amount Shiela will pay is the sum of the total cost without interest and the total interest:

\[ \text{Total amount to be paid} = \$750 + \$15 = \$765 \]

Since Shiela will pay this amount in 3 monthly installments, the monthly payment will be:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{\$765}{3} = \$255 \]

Therefore, Shiela will pay each month for 3 months:

\[ \$255 \]"
"First, let's round the prices to the nearest dollar:

- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3
- Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2
- Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each type of flower:

- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3 = $36
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2 = $18
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2 = $34

Finally, we add up the earnings from all the flowers:

$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

Artie will make $88."
"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level. We know that each level has half the square footage of the level below it, and the top level has a square footage of 16 square feet.

Let's denote the square footage of each level from top to bottom as follows:
- Level 1 (top): 16 square feet
- Level 2: 16 * 2 = 32 square feet
- Level 3: 32 * 2 = 64 square feet
- Level 4 (bottom): 64 * 2 = 128 square feet

Now, we can calculate the total square footage of the sandcastle by summing the square footage of all levels:
Total square footage = 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
Average square footage = Total square footage / Number of levels
Average square footage = 240 / 4 = 60 square feet

The average square footage of a level is 60 square feet."
"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will consume in the first 365 days.

For the first 180 days, the puppy will consume 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food for the first 180 days is:
\[ 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

For the remaining days of the first year, which is \(365 - 180 = 185\) days, the puppy will consume 2 cups of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food for the remaining 185 days is:
\[ 185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total amount of dog food consumed in the first year:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags needed is:
\[ \frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags} \]

Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year."
"Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, we can calculate the amount of laundry Raymond and David do based on the given relationships.

1. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. So, if Sarah does 400 pounds, then David does:
\[ \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

2. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. So, if Sarah does 400 pounds, then Raymond does:
\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds."
"To determine how much money Vincent saves, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in the most economical way versus the less economical way.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:
- Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
- Total cost: \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15.00 \)

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1.00 each:
- Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
- Total cost: \( 9 \times 1.00 = 9.00 \)

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two options:
- Cost difference: \( 15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00 \)

Therefore, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{6.00}

"The original cost of the grooming is $100. With a 30% discount, the cost is reduced by 30% of $100.

30% of $100 = 0.30 * $100 = $30

So, the discount amount is $30.

Subtract the discount from the original cost:
$100 - $30 = $70

The final cost of the grooming is $70."
"Each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water. So, the amount of water each girl got is:

\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they got together is:

\[ 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

The boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water distributed is:

\[ 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

The initial amount of water was 24 liters. Therefore, the amount of water left is:

\[ 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

10 liters of water were left."

"First, let's calculate Alex's weight. Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. So, we calculate 4 times Grace's weight and then subtract 2 pounds.

\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \]
\[ 500 - 2 = 498 \]

So, Alex weighs 498 pounds.

Now, to find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight to Alex's weight.

\[ 125 + 498 = 623 \]

Their combined weights are 623 pounds."

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( W + L = 22 \)
2. \( W = L + 8 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find the number of games they won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

1. The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.
2. The second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time, which means it rang 4 * 3 = 12 times.
3. The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time, which means it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, we add up the total number of rings:

4 (first time) + 12 (second time) + 6 (third time) = 22 times.

The alarm rang a total of 22 times."
"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial salary after 5 years.
2. Calculate the salary after each of the next three years, given the 10% annual increase.

**Step 1: Calculate the initial salary after 5 years.**

Sylvie's initial salary is $600. After 5 years, her salary is increased by 10% of $600 each year. The formula for the salary after \( n \) years is:
\[ \text{Salary after } n \text{ years} = \text{Initial Salary} \times (1 + \text{Increase Rate})^n \]

For 5 years:
\[ \text{Salary after 5 years} = 600 \times (1 + 0.10)^5 \]
\[ \text{Salary after 5 years} = 600 \times (1.10)^5 \]
\[ \text{Salary after 5 years} = 600 \times 1.61051 \]
\[ \text{Salary after 5 years} = 966.306 \]

So, after 5 years, Sylvie's salary is approximately $966.31.

**Step 2: Calculate the salary after each of the next three years.**

Now, we need to calculate the salary for each of the next three years, with a 10% increase each year.

After 6 years:
\[ \text{Salary after 6 years} = 966.306 \times 1.10 \]
\[ \text{Salary after 6 years} = 1062.9366 \]

After 7 years:
\[ \text{Salary after 7 years} = 1062.9366 \times 1.10 \]
\[ \text{Salary after 7 years} = 1169.23026 \]

After 8 years:
\[ \text{Salary after 8 years} = 1169.23026 \times 1.10 \]
\[ \text{Salary after 8 years} = 1286.153286 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is approximately $1286.15.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{1286.15} \]"
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies."
"Christina invited 16 friends, but since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we need to calculate the number of guests who are expected to attend.

1/4 of 16 friends don't show up, so:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \text{ friends don't show up} \]

Therefore, the number of friends who are expected to attend is:
\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ friends} \]

Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest. So, for 12 guests, she needs:
\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \text{ gift bags} \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost will be:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Christina will spend $18."
"To determine how much potato salad Ted needs to bring, we first calculate the amount each type of dinosaur will eat and then sum these amounts.

   - Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
   - There are 20 adults.
   - Total for adults: \( 20 \times 10 = 200 \) lbs.

2. **Child Dinosaur Consumption:**
   - Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) lbs.
   - There are 5 children.
   - Total for children: \( 5 \times 5 = 25 \) lbs.

3. **Total Potato Salad Needed:**

"First, we need to determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, and Lee's current time is 38 seconds, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's current time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to calculate Gerald's new time after his speed improved by 10%. An improvement in speed by 10% means that Gerald can now run 10% faster than his original time. Therefore, his new time is:

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = \text{Gerald's original time} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \text{ seconds} \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

So, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in \(\boxed{36}\) seconds."
"Given that the number of dogs is 60, and there are two cats for every dog, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we first find the combined number of dogs and cats:

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120
Combined number of dogs and cats = 180

The number of rabbits is twelve less than this combined number:

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the Grade 5 class.

The total number of students is 200. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, we calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the rest of the students are girls, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. According to the problem, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scout is 40."

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the volume of tomatoes before they are cooked into sauce.
2. Calculate the number of cans of tomatoes used.
3. Calculate the number of tomatoes used based on the number of cans.

First, we know that the sauce made is 32 ounces, and the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked. This means that the volume of the tomatoes before cooking was twice the volume of the sauce. So, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking is:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes were used to get 64 ounces of tomatoes. The number of cans used is:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is:
\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We start with 30 cars on the motorway.
2. After 15 minutes, some cars drive through the traffic jam.
3. In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through the traffic jam.
4. Additionally, 5 cars take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in both 15-minute intervals is \( x + 20 \).

Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that actually drove through the traffic jam is the total number of cars minus the 5 that took an exit. This can be expressed as:
\[ 30 - 5 = 25 \]

Therefore, we have the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

Final numerical answer:

"Mary initially has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, the total number of potted plants she has before receiving the new ones is:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Yesterday, she received 18 new potted plants. Adding these to her existing plants gives:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Tomorrow, she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family. Since there are 40 window ledges, she will give away:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Subtracting the plants she will give away from her total gives:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

Mary will remain with 58 potted plants."

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box, then find its inner volume, and finally multiply by 3 for the total volume of all 3 boxes.

Given that the walls are 1 inch thick, the inner dimensions of each box will be reduced by 2 inches in each direction (1 inch from each side). So, the inner dimensions of each box will be:

- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:

\[ \text{Inner Volume of one box} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \, \text{inches} \times 4 \, \text{inches} \times 2 \, \text{inches} = 24 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:

\[ \text{Total Inner Volume} = 24 \, \text{cubic inches/box} \times 3 \, \text{boxes} = 72 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches."
"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the total hours of TV he watched throughout the week and then isolate the Wednesday viewing.

1. **Monday and Tuesday**: Frankie watched 1-hour episodes each night.
   - Total for Monday and Tuesday: \(1 \, \text{hour} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 2 \, \text{hours}\)

2. **Thursday**: Frankie watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show.
   - Total for Thursday: \(1 \, \text{hour} + 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 1.5 \, \text{hours}\)

3. **Friday**: Frankie watched two 1-hour episodes.
   - Total for Friday: \(2 \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 2 \, \text{hours}\)

4. **Total hours for Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday**: 
   - \(2 \, \text{hours} + 1.5 \, \text{hours} + 2 \, \text{hours} = 5.5 \, \text{hours}\)

5. **Total hours of TV watched in the week**: 7 hours.

6. **Hours watched on Wednesday**:
   - \(7 \, \text{hours} - 5.5 \, \text{hours} = 1.5 \, \text{hours}\)

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, we can determine the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday by dividing the total hours watched on Wednesday by the length of each episode:
- Number of 30-minute episodes on Wednesday: \(1.5 \, \text{hours} \div 0.5 \, \text{hours/episode} = 3 \, \text{episodes}\)

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday."
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies.

However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he had left is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \).

We know that after dropping 5 cookies, he had 110 cookies left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

Final numerical answer:
50"
"To calculate the final cost after the cashback, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon.
2. Calculate the total cashback for 10 gallons at $0.20 per gallon.
3. Subtract the total cashback from the total cost to get the final cost.

Step 1: Total cost of 10 gallons of gas
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00/\text{gallon} = \$30.00 \]

Step 2: Total cashback for 10 gallons
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20/\text{gallon} = \$2.00 \]

Step 3: Final cost after cashback
\[ \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

The final cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is \$28.00."
"To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate in total, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each of them had.

For Beatrice:
- The roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice had is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

For Marcell:
- The roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell had is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Now, we add the total number of fruit roll-ups that both Marcell and Beatrice had:
- Total = \(48 + 42 = 90\).

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by the number of people (which is 2):
- Average = \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\).

Therefore, on average, they ate 45 fruit roll-ups."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many feet Julia rows to reach the shore and then calculate the amount of water that enters the boat based on the given rate.

First, we need to find out how many feet Julia rows in 64 seconds. We know that it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, we can calculate the rate at which she rows in feet per second:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5}{4} \text{ feet per second} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance she rows in 64 seconds:

\[ \text{Distance} = \left(\frac{5}{4} \text{ feet per second}\right) \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. To find out how much water is taken on for 80 feet, we use the ratio:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \left(\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore."
"To determine how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we can break down the problem step by step.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
2. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. So, Brittany's phone can hold \( \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \) photographs.
3. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as \( D \). Therefore, we have \( 300 = 50D \).
4. Solving for \( D \), we get \( D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \).

So, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is 6."
"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue from selling it, then find the difference between the two.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:

- Sasha bought ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each.
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
  \]

- She also bought five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each.
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
  \]

- The total cost of the lumber is:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:

- She sells the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards. Since the price has increased by 50%, the new price per board is:
  \[
  \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15
  \]
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150
  \]

- She sells the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at the new price, which is also 50% higher than the original price of $16:
  \[
  \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24
  \]
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120
  \]

- The total revenue from selling the lumber is:
  \[
  \$150 + \$120 = \$270
  \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[
\$270 - \$180 = \$90
\]

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of \(\boxed{90}\)."
"Given the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, we can represent the amount of sugar and water used as 7x and 13x respectively, where x is a common multiplier.

The total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 13x = 120\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[20x = 120\]

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now, to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used, we multiply the value of x by 7 (since the ratio of sugar is 7 parts):

\[7x = 7 \times 6 = 42\]

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is 42."
"John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children. Since each pair of shoes costs $60, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

1. First, find the total number of pairs of shoes: \(2 \text{ pairs/child} \times 3 \text{ children} = 6 \text{ pairs}\).
2. Then, calculate the total cost: \(6 \text{ pairs} \times \$60/\text{pair} = \$360\).

Therefore, John paid $360."
"On the first day, the customs officer counted 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles, which totals to:

2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles already at the port from the total:

30 vehicles - 10 vehicles = 20 vehicles

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:

20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.
   - Let Lylah's salary four years ago be \( L \).
   - Therefore, \( 40,000 = L + 0.30L \).
   - This simplifies to \( 40,000 = 1.30L \).
   - Solving for \( L \), we get \( L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} \approx 30,769.23 \).

2. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Four years later, his salary increased by 40%.
   - Therefore, Adrien's new salary is \( 40,000 + 0.40 \times 40,000 = 40,000 \times 1.40 = 56,000 \).

3. **Calculate Lylah's salary four years later:**
   - Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.
   - Assuming Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's (40%), her new salary is \( 30,769.23 + 0.40 \times 30,769.23 = 30,769.23 \times 1.40 \approx 43,076.92 \).

4. **Calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later:**
   - Adrien's new salary is $56,000.
   - Lylah's new salary is approximately $43,076.92.
   - Therefore, the total salary is \( 56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92 \).

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is $99,076.92."
"Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week. Since there are 30 sheets of paper in each pad, he uses \(2 \times 30 = 60\) sheets of paper per week.

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month."
"To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the number of fruits each person brought and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the number of fruits Morisette brought:
- Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges.
- Therefore, the total number of fruits Morisette brought is \(5 + 8 = 13\).

Next, let's determine the number of fruits Kael brought:
- Kael brought twice the number of apples that Morisette brought, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) apples.
- Kael brought half the number of oranges that Morisette brought, which is \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) oranges.
- Therefore, the total number of fruits Kael brought is \(10 + 4 = 14\).

Now, we add the total number of fruits brought by Morisette and Kael:
- The total number of fruits is \(13 + 14 = 27\).

Therefore, the total number of fruits they have is 27."
"Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday.

For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less each day, so:
- Tuesday: 8 - 2 = 6 hours

\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \]

So, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.
4. After using the spoons, she had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as \( x \).

So, the total number of spoons Julia had before using any was \( x + 5 \) (since her husband gave her 5 spoons).

After using 3 spoons, she had 12 spoons left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ x = 10 \]

So, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

"Given that each pepper costs $15, we can calculate the cost of the other items based on this information.

1. **Cost of a watermelon:**
   - A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.
   - Therefore, the cost of a watermelon = 3 * $15 = $45.

2. **Cost of an orange:**
   - An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs.
   - Therefore, the cost of an orange = $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the items Dillon is buying:

- **Cost of 4 watermelons:**
  - 4 * $45 = $180.

- **Cost of 20 peppers:**
  - 20 * $15 = $300.

- **Cost of 10 oranges:**
  - 10 * $40 = $400.

Finally, we add up the costs to find the total amount Dillon will spend:

- Total cost = $180 (watermelons) + $300 (peppers) + $400 (oranges) = $880.

**Total amount of money he will spend: $880.**"
"To calculate the hospital's profit from these visits, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time spent by doctors with patients in a day.
2. Calculate the total revenue from patients.
3. Calculate the total cost to the hospital for the doctors' time.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Total time spent by doctors with patients in a day:**
   - The hospital sees 500 people a day.
   - Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.
   - Total time in minutes = 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes.
   - Convert minutes to hours: 12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours.

2. **Total revenue from patients:**
   - The hospital charges $200 an hour to patients.
   - Total revenue = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

3. **Total cost to the hospital for the doctors' time:**
   - The doctors charge $150 an hour to the hospital.
   - Total cost = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

4. **Profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

The hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits."

1. B = 2Q (twice as many babies as queens)
2. W = 2B (twice as many worker bees as baby bees)
3. The total number of bees is 700, so W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting B and W in terms of Q into the total number of bees equation, we get:
W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q
B = 2Q

So, the total number of bees can be expressed as:
4Q + 2Q + Q = 700
7Q = 700
Q = 100

Now, we can find the number of worker bees:
W = 4Q = 4 * 100 = 400

Therefore, there are 400 worker bees in the hive."
"First, let's calculate how many hours Jordan spends playing video games in a week. Since he plays for 2 hours every day, and there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total hours spent playing video games as follows:

\[ 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{hours/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jordan would earn if he spent those 14 hours working instead of playing video games. Since he earns $10 per hour at his part-time job, we can calculate his earnings as follows:

\[ 14 \, \text{hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$140/\text{week} \]

Therefore, if Jordan spent his video game time working instead, he would earn \(\boxed{140}\) dollars in one week."
"First, let's identify the food and non-food items from the list:

- Milk: Food item (2 dollars)
- Eggs: Food item (3 dollars)
- Light bulbs: Non-food item (3 dollars)
- Cups: Non-food item (3 dollars)
- Roach traps: Non-food item (4 dollars)

Next, we calculate the total cost of the non-food items before tax:
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars

Total cost of non-food items = 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Now, we apply the 10% tax to the non-food items:
Tax on non-food items = 10 dollars * 10% = 10 dollars * 0.10 = 1 dollar

So, the total cost of the non-food items after tax is:
10 dollars + 1 dollar = 11 dollars

Now, we add the cost of the food items to the total cost of the non-food items after tax:
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars
- Total cost of food items = 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Total cost of everything = Cost of food items + Cost of non-food items after tax
Total cost of everything = 5 dollars + 11 dollars = 16 dollars

Final numerical answer:
16 dollars"
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have:

- Kim already has 3 clients.
- He is talking to 5 potential clients.
- Therefore, the total number of clients will be \(3 + 5 = 8\).

Next, we calculate the total expenses for the supplies:

- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
- The cost of 1 bottle of bleach is $2.
- The cost of 1 pack of cloths is $5.
- Therefore, the cost for supplies per client is \(2 \times 2 + 1 \times 5 = 4 + 5 = 9\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total expenses for all clients:

- The total number of clients is 8.
- The cost per client is $9.
- Therefore, the total expenses are \(8 \times 9 = 72\) dollars.

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:

- Total income = $92
- Total expenses = $72
- Profit = Total income - Total expenses = $92 - $72 = $20

Therefore, the profit Kim will make each week is $20."
"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare that John can harvest in one harvest.
2. Determine how many times John can harvest within a year.
3. Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the number of harvests in a year to get the total number of pineapples harvested in a year.

Step 1: Pineapples per hectare per harvest = 100 pineapples/hectare

Step 2: Number of harvests in a year = 12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests

Step 3: Total pineapples harvested in a year = Pineapples per hectare per harvest * Number of hectares * Number of harvests in a year
= 100 pineapples/hectare * 10 hectares * 4 harvests
= 4000 pineapples

Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year."
"Johnny has three Lego sets to pick up. 

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, which is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, which is \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

To find the total number of pieces Johnny picks up, we add the pieces from all three sets:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

Johnny picks up 2125 blocks."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return, which is 15 bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the first 6 hours leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
4. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first 6 hours and did not return in the second 6 hours return. Since 15 bees returned in the second 6 hours, 30 - 15 = 15 bees did not return in the second 6 hours. So, 15 bees from the first 6 hours plus the 60 bees that left in the third 6 hours return in the last 6 hours.

Therefore, the total number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is 15 (from the first 6 hours) + 60 (from the third 6 hours) = 75 bees.

75 bees returned to the hive in the last 6 hours."
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we first need to calculate the total cost of the tickets.

The cost for 1 child ticket is $10, and the cost for 1 adult ticket is $12. Therefore, the total cost for both tickets is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$10 + \$12 = \$22 \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means the amount she gave the cashier minus the total cost of the tickets equals $8. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ \text{Amount given} - \text{Total cost} = \text{Change} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Amount given} - \$22 = \$8 \]

To find the amount given, we add $22 to $8:

\[ \text{Amount given} = \$22 + \$8 = \$30 \]

Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up some equations based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, which can be written as \( 3D \).
- James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, which can be written as \( 4D \).
- Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook, so we can write the equation \( 3D = 12 \).

First, we solve for \( D \) (the number of friends Dorothy has):
\[ 3D = 12 \]
\[ D = \frac{12}{3} \]
\[ D = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find out how many friends James has:
\[ 4D = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends.

Final numerical answer:
16"
"To determine how long the winner will wait for the loser, we need to calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Steve's time: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Tim's time: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

The difference in their times is:
- \(40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\)

So, the winner (Steve) will wait for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

The final numerical answer is:
4 minutes"
"To calculate how much Shawnda made that day, we need to consider the number of tires inflated and the cost per tire.

- Each bicycle has 2 tires, so 5 bicycles mean \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- Each tricycle has 3 tires, so 3 tricycles mean \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- A unicycle has 1 tire, so 1 unicycle means \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Adding these up, the total number of tires inflated is \(10 + 9 + 1 = 20\).

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost is \(20 \times 0.25 = 5\) dollars.

Therefore, Shawnda made \(\boxed{5}\) dollars that day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys:

10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Next, we calculate the total cost of these cookies:

60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.00

Now, we determine how much change Carl receives if he pays with a $10 bill:

$10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00

So, the change Carl receives is $4.00."
"Let's work through the problem step by step, starting from the end and moving backwards.

1. **Final state**: 5 fries are left.
2. **Before the ants carried off the last fry**: There were 6 fries (since the ants carried off 1 fry).
3. **Before the raccoon stole two-thirds of the fries**: Let's denote the number of fries before the raccoon stole as \( x \). The raccoon stole two-thirds, so one-third remained. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{3}x = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 6 \times 3 = 18 \).
4. **Before the three pigeons ate their share**: Each pigeon ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries. Therefore, before the pigeons ate, there were \( 18 + 9 = 27 \) fries.
5. **Before the seagull ate half of what Dave ate**: Let's denote the number of fries the seagull ate as \( y \). The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, so Dave ate \( 2y \). The seagull ate \( y \) fries, and Dave ate \( 2y \) fries, so the total before the seagull ate was \( 27 + y + 2y = 27 + 3y \). Since the seagull ate half of what Dave ate, we have \( y = \frac{1}{2} \times 2y = y \), which is consistent. We need to find \( y \) such that the total before the seagull ate is consistent with the remaining fries. Since the seagull ate \( y \) fries and Dave ate \( 2y \) fries, and the total before the seagull ate was 27, we have \( 27 = 2y + y = 3y \). Solving for \( y \), we get \( y = 9 \). So, Dave ate \( 2y = 18 \) fries.
6. **Before Dave ate his fries**: The total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \( 27 + 18 = 45 \).

Therefore, the number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his schedule by days of the week and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the hours for a typical week:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day. So, for these three days, he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours per day. For three days, that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.
- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, for these two days, he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours per day. For two days, that's \(4 \times 2 = 8\) hours.

Adding these together, Kimo spends \(9 + 8 = 17\) hours per week in classes.

Now, we multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks in the semester:

- There are 16 weeks in the semester, so \(17 \times 16 = 272\) hours.

Therefore, in one semester, Kimo spends 272 hours attending classes."
"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the final answer needs to be in feet, we'll convert the measurements of the rolls and croissants from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot.

- Each roll is 4 inches long, which is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long, which is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Now, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good in feet:

- Total length of rolls: \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.
- Total length of croissants: \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.
- Total length of baguettes: \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

Adding these together gives the total length of all the baked goods:

\( 100 + 60 + 120 = 280 \) feet.

Therefore, if Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they will be 280 feet long."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we first calculate the monthly requirement for each type of ape and then double it for the 2-month period.

1. **Monkeys' Requirement:**
   - Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(200 \times 2 = 400\) bananas.

2. **Gorillas' Requirement:**
   - Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(400 \times 2 = 800\) bananas.

3. **Baboons' Requirement:**
   - Baboons need 100 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(100 \times 2 = 200\) bananas.

Now, we add up the total number of bananas needed for all the apes over 2 months:
\[400 \text{ (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas}\]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Since the football field is 100 yards long, running back and forth once is 200 yards. Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so the total distance Blake runs is:

\[ 200 \, \text{yards} \times 15 = 3000 \, \text{yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards, and she does this 34 times, so the total distance Kelly runs is:

\[ 80 \, \text{yards} \times 34 = 2720 \, \text{yards} \]

Now, we need to find out how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Since Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards, the difference in the distance they run is:

\[ 3000 \, \text{yards} - 2720 \, \text{yards} = 280 \, \text{yards} \]

So, the winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser."
"To find out how much Raphael spent on everything, we need to calculate the total cost of each item he bought and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the pens: \(4 \text{ pens} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pen} = \$6\)
2. The cost of the notebooks: \(2 \text{ notebooks} \times \$4 \text{ per notebook} = \$8\)
3. The cost of the rim of bond paper: \(\$20\)

Now, we add these amounts together to get the total cost:

\(\$6 + \$8 + \$20 = \$34\)

Therefore, Raphael spent a total of \$34 on everything."
"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 of them come out from hiding, and since they were already counted in the initial 11, we don't add them again. Instead, we consider that now he sees all 11 plus the 6 that were hiding, making it 17 tadpoles. However, then 2 of them hide under a rock, so we subtract those 2 from the total.

17 - 2 = 15

Finn can now see 15 tadpoles in the pond."
"On Monday, the tank has a depth of 17 feet.

On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth is:
17 feet + 7 feet = 24 feet

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday, so the depth is:
(2/3) * 24 feet = 16 feet

The tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin:

- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3

Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by Locsin:

- Starfish: 5 fewer than Anakin = 10 - 5 = 5
- Sea horses: 3 fewer than Anakin = 6 - 3 = 3
- Clownfish: 2 more than Anakin = 3 + 2 = 5

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, we add the total fish caught by Anakin and Locsin to find the total number of fish caught:

Total fish caught by Anakin and Locsin = 19 + 13 = 32

Final numerical answer:
32"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

First, let's determine how many times the price will increase in 36 months. Since the price increases every two months, we divide 36 by 2:

\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

This means the price will increase 18 times over 36 months.

The original price of the bag of marbles is $20. Each time the price increases, it increases by 20% of the original price. A 20% increase can be represented as multiplying by 1.20 (since 100% + 20% = 120%, or 1.20 in decimal form).

The formula to calculate the price after \( n \) increases is:

\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} \times (1.20)^n \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):

\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366 \]

So, the final price is:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32 \]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $787.32."
"Given the information:

1. One red car costs $4.
2. The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
3. An action figure costs $5.

First, let's calculate the cost of the doll:
- Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5, the doll costs \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the toys:
- 5 red cars, each costing $4, so the total cost for the red cars is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) dollars.
- 3 action figures, each costing $5, so the total cost for the action figures is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.
- 1 doll, costing $15.

Adding these together, the total cost of all the toys is:
\[20 + 15 + 15 = 50\]

Therefore, the total worth of all the toys is $50."
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant, we need to calculate the total cost of hiring the accountant and compare it to the lost income from doing her taxes herself.

1. Calculate the lost income from doing her taxes herself:
   - She loses $35 for each hour of freelance work.
   - She loses 3 hours of work.
   - Lost income = $35/hour * 3 hours = $105.

2. The cost of hiring an accountant is $90.

3. Compare the lost income to the cost of hiring the accountant:
   - Lost income from doing taxes herself = $105.
   - Cost of hiring an accountant = $90.
   - Difference = $105 - $90 = $15.

So, if Jackie hires the accountant, she will have $15 more. 

Final numerical answer:
$15"
"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she has chosen and subtract that from her budget.

The cost of the computer is €1090.
The cost of the screen is €157.
The cost of the keyboard and mouse is €74.
The cost of the CD burner is €74.
The cost of the printer is €102.

First, we add up the costs of all the items:
\[ 1090 + 157 + 74 + 74 + 102 = 1497 \]

Elvira's budget is €1500. So, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
\[ 1500 - 1497 = 3 \]

Therefore, Elvira will have €3 left for her clothing."
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she will need for 15 Spanish flans. Since each flan requires 3 eggs, we can find the total number of eggs required by multiplying the number of flans by the number of eggs per flan:

\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get 45 eggs. Since she gets 9 eggs each time she babysits, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:

\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28, so \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

We can simplify the second equation:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:
\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

16"
"Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. If Ethel has $8, we can calculate how much money Jimmy has as follows:

Twice the money Ethel has is \(2 \times 8 = 16\).

Adding $2 to that amount gives \(16 + 2 = 18\).

So, Jimmy has $18."
"Pancho walks 20 miles each day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, the total miles he walks from Monday to Friday is:

\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles each day. So, the total miles he walks on the weekend is:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the miles walked during the weekdays and the weekend gives:

\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Pancho walks a total of 120 miles in a week."
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the hat is given as $25.
2. The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so:
   \[ \text{Cost of jacket} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \]
3. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so:
   \[ \text{Cost of pants} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \]

Now, we sum up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to get the total cost of each uniform:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \]

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs for each group of creatures and then sum them up.

1. **Spiders:**
   - Number of spiders: 80
   - Legs per spider: 8
   - Total legs from spiders: \(80 \times 8 = 640\)

2. **Insects:**
   - Number of insects: 90
   - Legs per insect: 6
   - Total legs from insects: \(90 \times 6 = 540\)

3. **Rare mutant invertebrates:**
   - Number of rare mutant invertebrates: 3
   - Legs per rare mutant invertebrate: 10
   - Total legs from rare mutant invertebrates: \(3 \times 10 = 30\)

Now, we sum up the legs from all the creatures:
\[640 + 540 + 30 = 1210\]

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we need to find the total age of the four birds:

- Sally Two: 19 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- The age of the fourth bird (Caboose) is not given, so we assume it's the same as Sally Thirtytwo, which is 8 years old.

Adding these ages together:

\[19 + 8 + 16 + 8 = 41\]

The total age of the four birds is 41 years."
"First, let's calculate the total minimum monthly payment Jessica needs to make on all her debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. So, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum monthly payment and add it to the total minimum monthly payment:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

Therefore, the total monthly payment Jessica will make is:

$1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:

$1500 * 12 = $18000

So, Jessica pays $18000 in a year."
"To calculate the total time Billy will take to prep the potatoes, we need to consider the time taken for both peeling and cutting each potato.

1. Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
2. Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

First, we calculate the total time for peeling all 60 potatoes:
\[ 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the total time for cutting all 60 potatoes:
\[ 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 300 \text{ seconds} \]

Since 1 minute = 60 seconds, we convert 300 seconds to minutes:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost per gallon of lemonade:**
   - Cost of lemons per gallon: $3
   - Cost of sugar per gallon: $2
   - Total cost per gallon: $3 + $2 = $5

2. **Determine the revenue per gallon of lemonade:**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50
   - They get 20 glasses per gallon
   - Revenue per gallon: 20 glasses * $0.50/glass = $10

3. **Determine the profit per gallon of lemonade:**
   - Profit per gallon: Revenue per gallon - Cost per gallon
   - Profit per gallon: $10 - $5 = $5

4. **Determine the number of gallons they sold:**
   - They made a total profit of $25
   - Number of gallons sold: Total profit / Profit per gallon
   - Number of gallons sold: $25 / $5 = 5 gallons

5. **Determine the total cost of lemons:**
   - Cost of lemons per gallon: $3
   - Total cost of lemons: Number of gallons sold * Cost of lemons per gallon
   - Total cost of lemons: 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15

Therefore, they spent $15 on lemons."
"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to determine the total number of Chinese participants in the race.

Given:
- Total number of Asians: 240
- Number of Japanese: 80

The rest of the participants are Chinese, so we can calculate the number of Chinese participants as follows:
\[ \text{Number of Chinese} = \text{Total number of Asians} - \text{Number of Japanese} \]
\[ \text{Number of Chinese} = 240 - 80 = 160 \]

We are also given that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = \text{Number of Chinese} - \text{Number of boys} \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 160 - 60 = 100 \]

Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100."
"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent and car fuel.

1. Rent: \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his salary
   \[ \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \]

2. Car fuel: \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his salary
   \[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \]

Next, we calculate the remaining amount after these expenses:
\[ 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \]

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \]

After the donation, the remaining amount is:
\[ 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \]

Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$:
\[ 1250 - 200 - 700 = 350 \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations is:
\[ 350 \]"

"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we need to first find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, and Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies. Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( W \).

From the information given:
\[ 5W = 200 \]

Solving for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now, we know Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can denote the number of red roses as \( R \).

From the information given:
\[ R = 4W \]

Substituting the value of \( W \):
\[ R = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Jan is 30 years old.
2. Two years ago, Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.
3. Let's denote Mark's current age as \( M \).
4. Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
5. According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   M - 2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 28 + 5
   \]
6. Simplify the right side of the equation:
   \[
   M - 2 = 14 + 5 = 19
   \]
7. Solving for \( M \):
   \[
   M = 19 + 2 = 21

"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay race.

**Faster Team:**
Each of the four runners completes the 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time for the faster team = 4 runners * 55 seconds/runner = 220 seconds.

**Less Well-Rounded Team:**
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Total time for the less well-rounded team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

**Difference in Time:**
The faster team's total time is 220 seconds, and the less well-rounded team's total time is 222 seconds.
Difference = 222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by calculating the ratio of the probabilities and then converting it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[ \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \]

This means the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200\% \]

So, it is 200% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

**Final Answer: 200%**"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) pieces.

2. **Determine the total number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits:**
   - There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.

3. **Calculate the total number of pieces of straw used for the small rodents:**
   - The total number of pieces of straw used for the small rodents (rats and hamsters) is \(160\) pieces.
   - Subtract the pieces of straw used for the hamsters and the rabbits from the total to find the pieces of straw used for the rats.
   - Therefore, the number of pieces of straw used for the rats is \(160 - 50 - 20 = 90\) pieces.

4. **Determine the number of rats and the number of pieces of straw each rat gets:**
   - Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
   - The total number of pieces of straw used for the rats is 90 pieces.
   - Therefore, the number of rats is \(90 \div 6 = 15\) rats.

5. **Determine the number of rats in each cage:**
   - The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups.
   - Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is \(15 \div 3 = 5\) rats.

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to account for the monthly interest compounded each month.

1. **Initial Amount**: $100
2. **Monthly Interest Rate**: 2% or 0.02

**After 1st Month**:
- Interest = $100 * 0.02 = $2
- Total Amount = $100 + $2 = $102

**After 2nd Month**:
- Interest = $102 * 0.02 = $2.04
- Total Amount = $102 + $2.04 = $104.04

**After 3rd Month**:
- Interest = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808
- Total Amount = $104.04 + $2.0808 = $106.1208

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of bags the trader sold. Let's denote the number of bags as \( x \).

1. **Cost of buying the bags**: The cost per bag is $20, so the total cost for \( x \) bags is \( 20x \).

2. **Cost of transporting the bags**: The transportation cost per bag is $2, so the total transportation cost for \( x \) bags is \( 2x \).

3. **Total cost**: The total cost for the trader is the sum of the cost of buying the bags and the transportation cost, which is \( 20x + 2x = 22x \).

4. **Revenue from selling the bags**: The selling price per bag is $30, so the total revenue from selling \( x \) bags is \( 30x \).

5. **Profit**: The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. According to the problem, the trader made a total profit of $400. So, we can write the equation for profit as:
   \[
   30x - 22x = 400
   \]
   Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
   \[
   8x = 400
   \]
   Solving for \( x \), we divide both sides by 8:
   \[
   x = \frac{400}{8} = 50

So, the trader sold \(\boxed{50}\) bags."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The tickets cost $20.25 in total. The food cost $4.50 less than the tickets, so the food cost is:

\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the rides. Each ride costs $33, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is:

\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:

\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3 to find out how much each person paid:

"To find the cost of 8 pens, we first need to determine the cost of one pen.

Given:
- A pencil costs $1.20.
- An eraser costs $0.30.
- A pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined.

So, the cost of one pen is:
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \text{Cost of a pencil} + \text{Cost of an eraser} \]
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \$1.20 + \$0.30 \]
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \$1.50 \]

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens:
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \text{Cost of one pen} \]

"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we need to consider that she can remove her lowest score from the five tests before calculating the average. Let's first identify her lowest score among the first five tests:

- 89
- 71
- 92
- 100
- 86

The lowest score is 71. We will remove this score and calculate the average of the remaining four scores plus the sixth test score, aiming for an average of 93.

Let's denote the score Brinley needs on the sixth test as \( x \).

The sum of the scores of the four highest tests is:
\[ 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367 \]

Including the sixth test score, the sum of the five scores (after removing the lowest) will be:
\[ 367 + x \]

Since the average of these five scores needs to be 93, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \frac{367 + x}{5} = 93 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first multiply both sides by 5:
\[ 367 + x = 465 \]

Then, we subtract 367 from both sides:
\[ x = 465 - 367 \]
\[ x = 98 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 98 on her sixth test to get an average of 93.

First, let's calculate the distance for the first four weeks:
- He rode 5 times a week.
- Each ride was 25 kilometers.
- He did this for 4 weeks.

So, the total distance for the first four weeks is:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance for the following three weeks:
- He rode 2 times a week.
- Each ride was 60 kilometers.
- He did this for 3 weeks.

So, the total distance for the next three weeks is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ km/ride} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km} \]

Now, we add the distances from both periods to get the total distance:

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

To find the total number of cakes she bought over the three days, we add the number of cakes from each day:

\(4 + 12 + 60 = 76\)

So, Rose bought a total of 76 cakes after all three days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates would be 6 plates.
   - Therefore, the cost of half a dozen plates is \(6 \times 6000 = 36000\) dollars.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is \(36000 - 1200 = 34800\) dollars.

3. **Determine the cost of one dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups cost $34800.
   - Therefore, the cost of one dozen cups is \(\frac{34800}{20} = 1740\) dollars.

4. **Determine the cost of one cup:**
   - One dozen cups is 12 cups.
   - Therefore, the cost of one cup is \(\frac{1740}{12} = 145\) dollars.

The total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{145}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is $20 * 2 = $40.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Next, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- She babysits 4 times, earning $5 each time, so she earns $5 * 4 = $20 from babysitting.

Now, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from mowing the lawn:
- Let's say she needs to mow the lawn \( x \) times to earn enough money.
- Each time she mows the lawn, she earns $4, so she earns $4x from mowing the lawn.

Sara already has $10 saved. So, the total amount of money she will have after mowing the lawn \( x \) times is:
- $10 (initial savings) + $20 (from babysitting) + $4x (from mowing the lawn).

We need this total to be at least $70 to afford the jacket and shoes:
\[ 10 + 20 + 4x \geq 70 \]
\[ 30 + 4x \geq 70 \]
\[ 4x \geq 40 \]
\[ x \geq 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

Final numerical answer:
4"
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, as Gary walks around the edge. The park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles by 6 miles.

The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find the time (T) he spends walking, we use the formula:
\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the distance (15 miles) and speed (3 miles/hour):
\[ T = \frac{15}{3} \]
\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Gary spends 5 hours walking."
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total.

So, the number of customers on the third day is \(500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\).

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. We know that both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 \) gallons. This can be written as:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we have:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool now has \( 8 \) gallons of water.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the shoes and the belt is $352.00.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Her part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find the number of hours, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed.

The additional amount is 10% of $2000:
\[ 10\% \times 2000 = 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months at $165 per month:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Janeth's remaining balance by then will be:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"There are 4 roses in the vase. There are 7 more dahlias than roses, so there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias. 

To find the total number of flowers, we add the number of roses and dahlias together: 4 + 11 = 15.

Total number of flowers in the vase: 15."
"Given that Harriet is currently 21 years old, we can determine the ages of Adrian and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's age = 21 years
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age = 21 * 2 = 42 years
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's age = 21 * 3 = 63 years

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet's age = 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack's age = 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian's age = 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \]

The average age of the three in three years is 45 years."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by each of the other students and then subtract their total from the overall score.

1. **Naomi's Score:**
   Naomi scored 68 points.

2. **Yuri's Score:**
   Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, we calculate half of Naomi's points and then add 10.
   \[
   \text{Yuri's points} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]

3. **Brianna's Score:**
   Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, we add 17 to Naomi's points.
   \[
   \text{Brianna's points} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

4. **Total Points of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:**
   Now, we add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna.
   \[
   \text{Total points of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna} = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197
   \]

5. **Jojo's Score:**
   The total points scored by all four students is 251. To find Jojo's score, we subtract the total points of the other three students from the overall total.
   \[

"Initially, the water tank has 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters, so the amount of water left in the tank is:

120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters

Celine then collects rainwater, which is twice the amount left in the tank. So, the amount of rainwater collected is:

2 * 30 liters = 60 liters

Adding the rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives:

30 liters + 60 liters = 90 liters

Therefore, the final amount of water in the tank is:

90 liters"
"Andy plants 90 geraniums. He plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, which means he plants 90 - 40 = 50 petunias.

"First, let's calculate the new total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type cards and buying 14 grass type cards.

Initial count:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20
- Water type: 40

After the changes:
- Fire type: 30 (unchanged)
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

Now, let's find the total number of cards:
Total cards = 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96

Next, we calculate the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \frac{1}{3} \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = 33.3333\ldots \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest after two months.
2. Subtract the number of watermelons harvested after two months from the remaining watermelons to find out how many were left.
3. Calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest after two weeks.
4. Subtract the number of watermelons harvested after two weeks from the remaining watermelons to find out how many were not ready to be harvested.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest after two months:
   - 30% of 120 watermelons = 0.30 * 120 = 36 watermelons

2. Subtract the number of watermelons harvested after two months from the total:
   - Remaining watermelons after two months = 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons

3. Calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest after two weeks:
   - 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons = (3/4) * 84 = 63 watermelons

4. Subtract the number of watermelons harvested after two weeks from the remaining watermelons:
   - Remaining watermelons after two weeks = 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons

Therefore, the number of melons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is 21."
"To find out how much Mark pays for everything, we need to calculate the total cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees.

1. **Total cost of the cars:**
   - Each car costs $20,000.

"Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. Since he eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes per day. Together, they eat 6 (Steve) + 3 (girlfriend) = 9 tomatoes per day.

To find out how many tomatoes they need in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (days in a week):
9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 tomatoes/week.

Since a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed to produce 63 tomatoes is:
63 tomatoes/week ÷ 3 tomatoes/vine/week = 21 vines.

So, Steve needs 21 vines to produce enough tomatoes for both him and his girlfriend."

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens. These are all full pens.

2. **First Cycle of Refilling**: When these 25 pens are used up, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen. This means he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens from the ink of the 25 empty pens.

3. **Second Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 5 new pens plus the 25 original pens that were refilled, making a total of 30 pens. When these 30 pens are used up, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen. This means he can make 30 / 5 = 6 new pens from the ink of the 30 empty pens.

4. **Third Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 6 new pens plus the 30 original pens that were refilled, making a total of 36 pens. When these 36 pens are used up, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen.

22. **Twenty-First Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 150 new pens plus the 752 original pens that were refilled, making a total of 902 pens. When these 902 pens are used up, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen. This means he can make 902 / 5 = 180 new pens from the ink of the 902 empty pens (with a remainder of 2 empty pens, but we only count full sets of 5).

23. **Twenty-Second Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 180 new pens plus the 902 original pens that were refilled, making a total of 1082 pens. When these 1082 pens are used up, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen. This means he can make 1082 / 5 = 216 new pens from the ink of the 1082 empty pens (with a remainder of 2 empty pens, but we only count full sets of 5).

24. **Twenty-Third Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 216 new pens plus the 1082 original pens that were refilled, making a total of 1298 pens. When these 1298 pens are used up, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen. This means he can make 1298 / 5 = 259 new pens from the ink of the 1298 empty pens (with a remainder of 3 empty pens, but we only count full sets of 5).

25. **Twenty-Fourth Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 259 new pens plus the 1298 original pens that were refilled, making a total of 1557 pens. When these 1557 pens are used up, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen. This means he can make 1557 / 5 = 311 new pens from the ink of the 1557 empty pens (with a remainder of 2 empty pens, but we only count full sets of 5).

26. **Twenty-Fifth Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 311 new pens plus the 1557 original pens that were refilled, making a total of 1868 pens. When these 1868 pens are used up, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen. This means he can make 1868 / 5 = 373 new pens from the ink of the 1868 empty pens (with a remainder of 3 empty pens, but we only count full sets of 5).

27. **Twenty-Sixth Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 373 new pens plus the 1868 original pens that were refilled, making a total of 2241 pens. When these 2241 pens are used up, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen. This means he can make 2241 / 5 = 448 new pens from the ink of the 2241 empty pens (with a remainder of 1 empty pen, but we only count full sets of 5).

28. **Twenty-Seventh Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 448 new pens plus the 2241 original pens that were refilled, making a total of 2689 pens. When these 2689 pens are used up, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen. This means he can make 2689 / 5 = 537 new pens from the ink of the 2689 empty pens (with a remainder of 4 empty pens, but we only count full sets of 5).

29. **Twenty-Eighth Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 537 new pens plus the 2689 original pens that were refilled, making a total of 3226 pens. When these 3226 pens are used up, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen. This means he can make 3226 / 5 = 645 new pens from the ink of the 3226 empty pens (with a remainder of 1 empty pen, but we only count full sets of 5).

30. **Twenty-Ninth Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 645 new pens plus the 3226 original pens that were refilled, making a total of 3871 pens. When these 3871 pens are used up, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen. This means he can make 3871 / 5 = 774 new pens from the ink of the 3871 empty pens (with a remainder of 1 empty pen, but we only count full sets of 5).

31. **Thirtieth Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 774 new pens plus the 3871 original pens that were refilled, making a total of 4645 pens. When these 4645 pens are used up, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen. This means he can make 4645 / 5 = 929 new pens from the ink of the 4645 empty pens (with a remainder of 0 empty pens, so no more new pens can be made).

Therefore, the total number of pens he can have is 4645.

"Johnny started with an allowance of $20 and added an extra $10, so he had:

$20 + $10 = $30

This sum of $30 was then invested and tripled in a year. Therefore, the amount after a year would be:

$30 * 3 = $90

So, after a year, Johnny had $90."
"Given that Jessa is 20 years old, we can determine the ages of Joan and Mary as follows:

1. Joan is five years older than Jessa, so Joan's age is:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25 \text{ years old}
   \]

2. Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary's age is:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23 \text{ years old}
   \]

Now, to find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we add their ages together:
\[
20 + 25 + 23 = 68
\]

The sum of the ages of the three girls is 68."
"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.
2. Calculate the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A.
3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students.
4. Subtract the number of students who went out through exits A and B from the total to find the number who went out through exit C.

Let's start with step 1:

1. 30% of 1000 students went out through exit A:
   \[
   0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]

2. The number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A:
   \[
   1000 - 300 = 700
   \]

3. 3/5 of the remaining 700 students went out through exit B:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
   \]

4. The number of students who went out through exit C is the remaining students after those who went out through exits A and B:
   \[
   700 - 420 = 280
   \]

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the number of candies Robert has as \( R \).

Given that John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies, we can write:
\[ 2R = 54 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

So, Robert has 27 candies.

James has 6 more candies than Robert, so:
\[ \text{James's candies} = R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James."
"Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book. If both read each other's books as well as their own, we need to consider the total number of books read by each person and avoid double-counting.

Dolly will read her 2 books plus Pandora's 1 book, which totals 3 books.
Pandora will read her 1 book plus Dolly's 2 books, which totals 3 books.

However, since the question asks for the total number of books read collectively, and each book is read once by either Dolly or Pandora, the total number of books read is the sum of the unique books.

So, collectively, they will read 2 (Dolly's books) + 1 (Pandora's book) = 3 books.

By the end, they will collectively read 3 books."
"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike is still corresponding with after he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. He originally had 5 pen pals and stopped being pen pals with 2, so he is now corresponding with:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, so the total number of letters Mike receives in a week is:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 6 letters a week. Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages he writes in a week is:

\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \]

Mike writes a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, the total time he spends writing a week is:

\[ 30 \times 6 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert this time into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{180}{60} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Mike spends 3 hours writing a week."
"First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason uses for his 15-minute calls with his boss each day. Since there are 30 days in the month, he uses:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes he used for calls to other people:

\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the monthly plan of 1000 minutes:

\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Jason has 250 minutes left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin now has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Griffin now has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries.
4. Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. So, Griffin now has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than what Kyle took, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Griffin now has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

**Final Answer:**

"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

The total number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 4 + 32 = 36 \).

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. The difference in the number of snails is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

So, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times (2F) \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium."
"To calculate the total amount Jean paid for the makeup services, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily cost of the makeup artist's services.
2. Calculate the weekly cost of the makeup artist's services.
3. Calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks of work.
4. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.

Let's start with the daily cost:

- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
- It takes 6 hours each day to do the makeup.
- Therefore, the daily cost is \( 250 \times 6 = 1500 \) dollars.

Next, we calculate the weekly cost:

- She needs the makeup done 4 times a week.
- Therefore, the weekly cost is \( 1500 \times 4 = 6000 \) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks:

- The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
- Therefore, the total cost before the discount is \( 6000 \times 5 = 30000 \) dollars.

Finally, we apply the 10% discount:

- The discount is 10% of the total cost.
- Therefore, the discount amount is \( 30000 \times 0.10 = 3000 \) dollars.
- The final amount Jean paid is \( 30000 - 3000 = 27000 \) dollars.

So, Jean paid a total of $27,000."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Isabelle spent on the party supplies:

- Cake ingredients: $12

- Invitations: $4
- Goodie bags: $22

Adding these amounts together:

$12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, so the cost is divided into 3 equal parts:

$96 ÷ 3 = $32

Each person paid $32."
"The chef bought 4 bags of onions, with each bag weighing 50 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of onions is:

4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

The cost of onions is $1.50 per pound, so the total cost is:

200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 5 cookies, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 13 cookies, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

In total, Sue ate \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.

Her sister ate \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies in total.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

Her sister consumed \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.

The difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister is \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories.

Therefore, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."
"To find the number of boys in the third class, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of students in the school:**
   - Each class has 20 students.
   - There are 3 classes.
   - Therefore, the total number of students in the school is \(20 \times 3 = 60\).

2. **Number of boys and girls in the school:**
   - The school is 50% boys and 50% girls.
   - Therefore, the number of boys in the school is \(60 \times 0.5 = 30\).
   - The number of girls in the school is also \(60 \times 0.5 = 30\).

3. **Number of girls in the first and second classes:**
   - The first class has 15 girls.
   - The second class has 12 girls.
   - Therefore, the total number of girls in the first and second classes is \(15 + 12 = 27\).

4. **Number of girls in the third class:**
   - Since the total number of girls in the school is 30, the number of girls in the third class is \(30 - 27 = 3\).

5. **Number of boys in the third class:**
   - Each class has 20 students, so the third class has 20 students in total.
   - Since there are 3 girls in the third class, the number of boys in the third class is \(20 - 3 = 17\).

Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is 17."
"Travis originally had 61 apps. After deleting 9 apps, he had:

"Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's denote the number of cougars killed today as \( C \). Therefore, the number of wolves killed today is \( 3C \).

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, \( C = 15 - 3 = 12 \).

Thus, today Rick killed \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) wolves.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals killed over the two days:

- Wolves: \( 10 + 36 = 46 \)
- Cougars: \( 15 + 12 = 27 \)

Total animals killed: \( 46 + 27 = 73 \)

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's determine how many times Anne went down the slide. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. Mitchel went down the slide 30 times, so we calculate 30% of 30:

\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]

Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, so we subtract 9 from 30:

\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Anne went down the slide 21 times. Now, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, so we multiply 21 by 4:

\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 84 \]"
"Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, which means there are a total of \(10 \times 20 = 200\) cows.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, each stall gets \(40 \div 20 = 2\) new cows.

After adding the new cows, each stall now has \(20 + 2 = 22\) cows.

Therefore, 8 of the stalls will have \(8 \times 22 = 176\) cows in total.

"First, let's calculate the total number of 10-foot sections in the 200-foot tall redwood:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight of the redwood before termites ate any of it is:

\[ 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Termites ate 30% of the redwood, so 70% of the redwood remains. To find the remaining weight, we calculate 70% of 8000 pounds:

\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the weight of the redwood after the termites have eaten 30% of it is:

\[ 5600 \text{ pounds} \]"

"Given that Andrea has 52 apples, we can start by determining how many apples Jamal has. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Andrea's apples} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]

Substituting the number of apples Andrea has:

\[ 52 = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]

Solving for Jamal's apples:

\[ \text{Jamal's apples} = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

Next, we know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. So, we can calculate the number of bananas Jamal has:

\[ \text{Jamal's bananas} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can find the number of bananas Andrea has:

\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{\text{Jamal's bananas}}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits:

\[ \text{Total fruits} = \text{Andrea's apples} + \text{Andrea's bananas} + \text{Jamal's apples} + \text{Jamal's bananas} \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 168 \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits is 168."
"To determine how many cups of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making over the two days and then figure out how much flour is required based on the given ratio.

1. Calculate the total number of cookies:
   - Today: 36 cookies
   - Tomorrow: 30 cookies
   - Total: 36 + 30 = 66 cookies

2. Determine the amount of flour needed:
   - 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies.
   - To find out how many cups are needed for 66 cookies, we set up a proportion:
     \[
     \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}}
     \]
   - Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{132}{12} = 11 \text{ cups}
     \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate how many pennies are in that stack.

1. Calculate two thirds of 9,300 pennies:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9,300 = \frac{2 \times 9,300}{3} = \frac{18,600}{3} = 6,200 \text{ pennies} \]

2. Convert the number of pennies to dollars. Since 100 pennies equal 1 dollar:
\[ 6,200 \text{ pennies} \div 100 = 62 \text{ dollars} \]

The total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is 62 dollars."

\[ 250 + 20 = 270 \]

Therefore, Maddison has 270 marbles now."
"First, let's determine the number of trees Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, and Chris has 6 trees, Ferdinand has:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ trees} \]

Next, we calculate the number of trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has 3 trees, twice that number is:

\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Adding 5 to this number gives us the number of trees Harry has:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ trees} \]

Now, to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:

\[ 11 - 3 = 8 \]

So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ 8 \]"

"To determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then compare it to her budget.

1. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   \[
   \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \text{ of } \$350,000 = 0.05 \times 350,000 = \$17,500
   \]

2. **Calculate the transfer fee:**
   \[
   \text{Transfer fee} = 12\% \text{ of } \$350,000 = 0.12 \times 350,000 = \$42,000

\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

3. **Remaining Loan Amount**: $250,000

Now, we subtract these amounts from the selling price to find the net proceeds.

\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Transfer Fees} - \text{Brokerage Fee} - \text{Remaining Loan Amount} \]
\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = 400,000 - 12,000 - 20,000 - 250,000 \]
\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = 400,000 - 282,000 \]
\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = 118,000 \]

Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are $118,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and calculate the time for each part.

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:** This takes 20 minutes.

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:** It takes 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees. 
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:** It takes 5 minutes less time than the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - The total heating time to 400 degrees is 28 minutes.
   - So, the cooking time is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

4. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:** This is the sum of the heating time to 300 degrees, the additional heating time to 400 degrees, and the cooking time.
   - Total time = \(20 + 28 + 23 = 71\) minutes.

Therefore, the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 71 minutes."
"To find out how much the real estate agent spent on all the ads, we need to calculate the total cost for the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the newspaper ads:
- The cost per newspaper ad is $5.
- The number of newspaper ads bought is 50.
- Therefore, the total cost for newspaper ads is \(5 \times 50 = 250\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the television ads:
- The cost per television ad is $75.
- The number of television ads bought is 15.
- Therefore, the total cost for television ads is \(75 \times 15 = 1125\) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs for the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost for newspaper ads + Cost for television ads
- Total cost = \(250 + 1125 = 1375\) dollars.

The real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on buying all the ads."
"The juggler can juggle 16 balls in total. Half of these balls are golf balls, so there are 16 / 2 = 8 golf balls. Half of these golf balls are blue, so there are 8 / 2 = 4 blue golf balls.

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary bought, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then sum them up.

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has \(300 / 2 = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, we add the M&Ms from all three bags together:
\[300 + 312 + 150 = 762\]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. John has 2 houses.
2. Each house has 3 bedrooms.
3. Each bedroom has 2 windows.
4. There are an additional 4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms.

First, calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:
- Each house has 3 bedrooms.
- Each bedroom has 2 windows.
- Therefore, each house has \(3 \times 2 = 6\) windows in the bedrooms.

Since there are 2 houses, the total number of bedroom windows is:
- \(2 \times 6 = 12\) windows.

Next, calculate the number of additional windows in each house:
- Each house has 4 additional windows.
- Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is:
- \(2 \times 4 = 8\) windows.

Now, add the number of bedroom windows and the additional windows to get the total number of windows:
- Total windows = bedroom windows + additional windows
- Total windows = \(12 + 8 = 20\)

Therefore, the total number of windows between the houses is 20."
"To find out how much change the cashier gives back, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items the mother bought. 

The cost of cocoa is $4.20, the cost of laundry is $9.45, and the cost of the package of pasta is $1.35. Adding these amounts together:

\[ 4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35 = 15.00 \]

The mother pays with $20. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:

\[ 20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00 \]

So, the change the cashier gives back is $5.00."
"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we first need to calculate the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

1. The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches the body of the sweater takes. So, the collar takes \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
2. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so the rosette takes \( 90 \times 2 = 180 \) stitches.

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We can subtract the stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette to find out how many stitches are left for the sleeves.

3. The total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette is \( 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \) stitches.
4. The remaining stitches for the sleeves are \( 1800 - 1170 = 630 \) stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the remaining stitches by 2 to find out how many stitches each sleeve takes.

5. Each sleeve takes \( \frac{630}{2} = 315 \) stitches.

Therefore, each sleeve takes 315 stitches."
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the tomato seeds:
- Number of tomato seed packets: 20
- Cost per packet of tomato seeds: $40
- Total cost for tomato seeds: \( 20 \times 40 = 800 \) dollars

Next, let's calculate the cost for the celery seeds:
- Number of celery seed packets: 80
- Cost per packet of celery seeds: $30
- Total cost for celery seeds: \( 80 \times 30 = 2400 \) dollars

Now, we add the total costs for both types of seeds:
- Total cost for tomato seeds: $800
- Total cost for celery seeds: $2400
- Total cost for all seeds: \( 800 + 2400 = 3200 \) dollars

Therefore, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is $3200."
"To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each part and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\) lines from the first scene.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\) lines from the second scene.

Now, we sum up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
- Solo song: 54 lines
- First scene: 36 lines
- Second scene: 48 lines

Total lines = \(54 + 36 + 48 = 138\)

**Final numerical answer:**

"First, let's calculate the number of cards with the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

So, 32 cards had the letter A on them.

Next, we find out how many cards are left after removing the cards with the letter A:

\[ 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Now, 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B on them. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

This means 24 cards had the letter B on them.

We then find out how many cards are left after removing the cards with the letter B:

\[ 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Next, 5/8 of the rest of the cards had the letter C on them. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

This means 15 cards had the letter C on them.

Finally, to find out how many cards had the letter D on them, we subtract the number of cards with letters A, B, and C from the total number of cards:

\[ 80 - (32 + 24 + 15) = 80 - 71 = 9 \]

So, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To calculate the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time for the small holes:
   - Time for one small hole = 3 minutes
   - Total time for 30 small holes = 30 * 3 = 90 minutes

2. Calculate the total time for the large holes:
   - Time for one large hole = 10 minutes
   - Total time for 15 large holes = 15 * 10 = 150 minutes

3. Add the total times for small and large holes:
   - Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

4. Convert the total time from minutes to hours:
   - 240 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 4 hours

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes."
"The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 20 + 20 = 40.

In 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older, so the total sum of their ages will increase by 20 years. Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40."
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Expanding the right side of the equation:

\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:

\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

Final numerical answer:
Sam is 6 years old."

- Total cost = \(5 + 2 = 7\) dollars.

Therefore, Peter paid a total of 7 dollars."
"First, let's determine the number of spots on a mamba. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can calculate the number of spots on a mamba as follows:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas, so:

\[ \text{Total spots on cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]
\[ \text{Total spots on mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of spots for all the snakes:

\[ \text{Total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots:

\[ \text{Half the total number of spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

2450"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people at the soccer game:

- There are 12 team members.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 guests.
- There are also 3 coaches.

So, the total number of people is 12 (team members) + 24 (guests) + 3 (coaches) = 39 people.

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3:

39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pizza costs $15, so:

13 * $15 = $195.

Maddy will spend $195."
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones.
2. Subtract this length from the total length of the necklace to find the length occupied by the sterling silver beads.
3. Divide the length occupied by the sterling silver beads by the length of each bead to find the number of beads.

Let's start with step 1:

- Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
- Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
- Therefore, the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones is \(8 \times 1 = 8\) inches.

Next, step 2:

- The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
- The length occupied by the topaz gemstones is 8 inches.
- Therefore, the length occupied by the sterling silver beads is \(25 - 8 = 17\) inches.

Finally, step 3:

- Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long.
- To find the number of beads, we divide the length occupied by the beads by the length of each bead: \(17 \div \frac{1}{4} = 17 \times 4 = 68\).

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace."
"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. 

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we add the stories from both weeks:
- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Adding these together gives us the total number of stories:

"To find the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars and then subtract the stars in the other rows.

1. Calculate the total number of stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and 2 rows of 6 stars:
   - 3 rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars
   - 2 rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars
   - Total stars in these rows: \(24 + 12 = 36\) stars

2. The flag has 76 stars in total. Subtract the stars in the known rows from the total to find the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
   - Stars in 5-star rows: \(76 - 36 = 40\) stars

3. To find the number of 5-star rows, divide the number of stars in 5-star rows by 5:
   - Number of 5-star rows: \(40 \div 5 = 8\)

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag."
"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, we first need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight for 80 flagstones is:

\[ 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to carry this total weight, given that each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds. We divide the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks} \]

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members, each consuming 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and eating rice at both lunch and dinner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily rice consumption for the household.
2. Determine the total weekly rice consumption.
3. Calculate how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

**Step 1: Calculate the total daily rice consumption for the household.**

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since each person eats rice at both lunch and dinner, each person consumes:
\[ 0.2 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 0.4 \, \text{kg/day} \]

For 5 members of the household, the total daily consumption is:
\[ 0.4 \, \text{kg/person/day} \times 5 \, \text{persons} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total weekly rice consumption.**

There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly consumption is:
\[ 2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{kg/week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.**

To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's calculate the total number of crates sold:

- Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates.
- On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
- On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
- On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

Now, let's add these numbers together:

20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:

120 (target) - 65 (sold) = 55 crates

So, Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week."
"To determine the total cost of the antique desk for Carmen, we need to calculate the sum of all the bids she made. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Bid**: Carmen starts with an opening bid of $200.
2. **Bids by Others**: There are 3 other people who each bid once. Since the bids rise by $50 each time, the bids by the other people are:
   - First other person: $200 + $50 = $250
   - Second other person: $250 + $50 = $300
   - Third other person: $300 + $50 = $350

3. **Carmen's Bids**: Carmen bids after each of the other people, so her bids are:
   - After the first other person: $300
   - After the second other person: $350
   - After the third other person: $400

4. **Total Cost**: The total cost is the sum of all the bids Carmen made, including the initial bid and her subsequent bids:

   - Total mileage cost per year: 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000

2. **Monthly Bonuses:**
   - Bonus per month: $150
   - Number of months in a year: 12
   - Total bonus cost per year: $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost per year = Total mileage cost + Total bonus cost
   - Total cost per year = $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800

Therefore, John pays a total of $31,800 a year for the driving service."
"To find out how many minutes Peter has to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

So, the total time exercised on Monday and Sunday combined is:
23 minutes + 16 minutes = 39 minutes.

Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined on Tuesday. Therefore, we need to multiply the total time by 2:
39 minutes * 2 = 78 minutes.

So, Peter has to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the folding and printing process. Each piece of paper, when folded in half, can print 4 pages: 2 on the front and 2 on the back. 

For a 32-page tabloid, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper as follows:

1. Each piece of paper can print 4 pages.
2. To find out how many pieces of paper are needed, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages each piece of paper can print.

\[ \text{Number of pieces of paper} = \frac{\text{Total number of pages}}{\text{Pages per piece of paper}} = \frac{32}{4} = 8 \]

So, 8 pieces of paper would be used in a 32-page tabloid.

"Annika started with $50. She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

So, she spent $25 on food and snacks. She also spent an additional $10 on rides. Therefore, the total amount spent is:

\[ 25 + 10 = 35 \]

To find out how much is left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:

\[ 50 - 35 = 15 \]

So, the amount left is $15."
"To find out how much money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of books sold in the first year.
2. Determine the number of books sold in the second year.
3. Calculate the earnings for the second year.

First, we know that Elise currently has 50 unsold books and she has sold 45 books this year. This means she has sold a total of \(250 - 50 = 200\) books over the three years. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, and she sold 45 books this year, she sold \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books in the first year.

Now, we can find out how many books she sold in the second year by subtracting the books sold in the first and third years from the total books sold:
\[200 - 90 - 45 = 65\]
So, she sold 65 books in the second year.

Since each book sells for $20, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is:
\[65 \times 20 = 1300\]

Therefore, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is $1300."
"To calculate how much money Watson made in April, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Watson's daily earnings.
2. Calculate his weekly earnings without the bonus.
3. Calculate his total weekly earnings including the bonus.
4. Determine the number of weeks in April.
5. Calculate his total earnings for April.

Step 1: Watson's daily earnings
Watson earns $10 per hour and works 10 hours a day.
Daily earnings = $10/hour * 10 hours/day = $100/day

Step 2: Watson's weekly earnings without the bonus
Watson works 5 days a week.
Weekly earnings without bonus = $100/day * 5 days/week = $500/week

Step 3: Watson's total weekly earnings including the bonus
Watson gets a $300 bonus each week.
Total weekly earnings with bonus = $500/week + $300/week = $800/week

Step 4: Number of weeks in April
April typically has 4 weeks.

Step 5: Watson's total earnings for April
Total earnings for April = $800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April if the company performed very well for the whole month."
"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. 

To find out how many people he beat, we calculate 80% of 20:
\[ 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \]

Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total and beat 16 of them, the number of people he lost to is:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

He lost to 4 people."
"First, let's calculate how many loaves are sold in the morning. Two-thirds of the 60 loaves are sold in the morning:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning. This leaves:

\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \]

loaves unsold after the morning. Half of these remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening. So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is 10."
"Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so he loses 2 pounds per week (8 pounds / 4 weeks).

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will take 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds.

To lose 8 pounds, which is the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks, Sandy would need twice the time since he takes 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds. Therefore, Sandy will need 8 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

8 weeks"
"To calculate the savings, let's first determine the discount on each item and then apply it to the quantities purchased.

1. **Discount on ice cream:**
   - Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
   - Sale price of one tub of ice cream: $11
   - Discount per tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

2. **Discount on milk:**
   - Discount per packet of milk: $0.5

Now, let's calculate the total savings for 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk.

3. **Total savings on ice cream:**
   - Savings per tub: $2
   - Total savings for 2 tubs: $2 * 2 = $4

4. **Total savings on milk:**
   - Savings per packet: $0.5
   - Total savings for 4 packets: $0.5 * 4 = $2

5. **Total savings:**
   - Total savings on ice cream: $4
   - Total savings on milk: $2
   - Combined total savings: $4 + $2 = $6

**Final numerical answer:**
You will save $6 if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk."
"To determine the number of new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many times the serum will cause the person to grow an extra arm and an extra leg within that period.

1. **Growth of Arms:**
   - The serum causes an extra arm every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra arms grown is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).

2. **Growth of Legs:**
   - The serum causes an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra legs grown is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs.
   - Total new limbs = 5 (arms) + 3 (legs) = 8.

After fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow a total of 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, the cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
\[ 5 \times \$100 + \$700 = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

The total amount Theo wants to save is $2000. Therefore, the total amount he can spend on the trip is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

Now, let's sum up the costs of the suits, suitcases, and flight ticket:
\[ \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$2050 \]

The amount left for buying gifts is:
\[ \$4000 - \$2050 = \$1950 \]

Therefore, Theo has to spend \(\boxed{1950}\) on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"First, let's calculate the daily egg consumption for the family.

- Three people eat 3 eggs each, so that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
- The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each, so that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.

Adding these together, the family consumes \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs per day.

To find out how many eggs the family consumes in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

So, \(13 \times 7 = 91\) eggs.

The family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"If Quinn is 30 years old, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, then Jane is:

30 - 3 = 27 years old.

Since Trent is 5 years older than Jane, Trent's age is:

27 + 5 = 32 years old.

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old."
"Given that Cera is currently 46 years old, six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.

Let's denote Noah's age six years ago as \(N\). According to the problem, six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. Therefore, we can write the equation for Noah's age six years ago as:
\[N = \frac{40}{2} = 20\]

The problem also states that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time. So, the population of Chile six years ago was:
\[3000 \times 20 = 60000\]

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, the current population of Chile is:
\[60000 \times 2 = 120000\]

Therefore, the population of Chile now is 120000."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem, the number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).

The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{1}{2}D \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3.5D = 105 \]

To find \( D \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3.5:

\[ D = \frac{105}{3.5} = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

Final numerical answer:
30"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we know that 8 people couldn't come due to illness. Additionally, 1/4 of that number (8) had previous commitments. So, we calculate 1/4 of 8:

\(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\)

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

To find out how many people actually show up, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:

\(24 - 10 = 14\)

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the number of marbles Solomon received from his father. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, and his father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought. So, the number of marbles his father gave him is:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8
\]

Now, let's find the total number of marbles Solomon has. He initially had 50 marbles in the store, bought 20 more from Johanna, and received 8 more from his father. Therefore, the total number of marbles is:

\[
50 + 20 + 8 = 78
\]

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of the marbles is:

\[
78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kgs}
\]

The total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is:

\[
156 \text{ kgs}

"To calculate the cost to fill the pool, we first need to determine the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep, so the volume \( V \) is calculated as:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \times 5 \, \text{ft} \]
\[ V = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

The cost to fill the pool is $.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = V \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{\$/cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 12 \, \text{\$} \]

The cost to fill the pool is $12."
"Given that the classroom has 30 boys, we can use the information provided to find the number of girls and nongendered children.

1. The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys:
   \[ \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

2. The number of nongendered children is 1/10 the number of boys:
   \[ \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \]

To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
\[ \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

Total number of children: 123"
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

Since the ratio is 1:3, for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires. Therefore, if there are 45 electric wires, we can set up the following proportion to find the number of electric poles:

\[ \text{Number of electric poles} = \frac{\text{Number of electric wires}}{3} \]

Substituting the given number of electric wires:

\[ \text{Number of electric poles} = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15."
"At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, 1/4 of 40 people is 10 people.

This means that 30 people stayed at the party (40 - 10 = 30).

We are told that 22 men stayed at the party. Since the total number of people who stayed is 30, the number of women who stayed can be calculated as follows:

30 (total people who stayed) - 22 (men who stayed) = 8 women who stayed.

So, the number of women left at the party is 8."
"The magazine costs half as much as a book, and the book costs $4. So, the magazine costs:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = \$2 \]

A pen costs $1 less than a magazine, so the pen costs:

\[ 2 - 1 = \$1 \]

The pen costs $1."
"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. According to the problem, Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together give a total of 26 pencils. 

We can set up the equation for Jam's pencils as follows:
\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + \text{Loose pencils} = \text{Total pencils} \]
\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + 2 = 26 \]

To find the number of pencils in the boxes, we subtract 2 from 26:
\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} = 26 - 2 = 24 \]

Now, we know that Jam has 24 pencils in boxes and 2 loose pencils, making a total of 26 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many pencils Jam and Meg have in total:
\[ \text{Total pencils} = \text{Jam's pencils} + \text{Meg's pencils} \]
\[ \text{Total pencils} = 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Now, we need to determine how many boxes are needed to store all 72 pencils. Since we know that Jam's 24 pencils were stored in 3 boxes, we can assume that each box holds the same number of pencils. Let's find out how many pencils each box holds:
\[ \text{Pencils per box} = \frac{\text{Number of pencils in boxes}}{\text{Number of boxes}} \]
\[ \text{Pencils per box} = \frac{24}{3} = 8 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of boxes needed to store all 72 pencils:
\[ \text{Total boxes needed} = \frac{\text{Total pencils}}{\text{Pencils per box}} \]
\[ \text{Total boxes needed} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils."
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to calculate the total weakening effect from the ice cubes and the cream added.

First, let's calculate the weakening effect from the ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we can find out how many ice cubes were added by dividing 65 by 13:

\[ \frac{65}{13} = 5 \]

So, 5 ice cubes were added. Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, the total weakening effect from the ice cubes is:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters} \]

Next, we need to account for the cream added. The problem states that any added liquid also weakens the coffee. Since 15 milliliters of cream were added, this adds an additional 15 milliliters of weakening.

Adding the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream gives us the total weakening:

\[ 60 + 15 = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio and how it applies to the number of new records the people received.

Given:
- The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record.
- 5 people trade and leave with 7 new records.

First, we calculate the total number of old records traded for the 7 new records. Since 1 new record is obtained by trading 2 old records, for 7 new records, the number of old records traded would be:
\[ 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

Therefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior programmers. Given that the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, and the total number of employees is 100, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total monthly payment to junior programmers is:

\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so their monthly payment is:

\[ \text{Monthly payment to senior programmers} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

The total monthly payment to senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:

\[ \text{Total payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:

\[ \boxed{224000} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal be \( x \).

2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).

3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

4. Simplifying the expression, we get \( x + 6 \).

5. We know that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, \( x + 6 = 20 \).

6. Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 20 - 6 = 14 \).

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\).
3. He passes 14 out to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\).
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends: \(14 \times 2 = 28\). So, he now has \(8 + 28 = 36\).
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\).
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\).

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31."
"To fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, it needs an additional 40 percentage points of charge. Given that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to recharge the remaining 40 percentage points as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes per percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ 120 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."
"Erin starts with 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her another 10 lollipops, so she then has:

She has 14 lollipops left."
"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

\[ \text{Rewards earned} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards. The coupon applied twice the amount of the rewards off the price. Since they have $4 in rewards, the coupon applied:

\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount they would have paid without the rewards and the coupon:

\[ 43 + 4 = 47 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the coupon amount from this total:

\[ 47 - 8 = 39 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the customer paid:

\[ \boxed{39} \]"
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A:

- Annual pay: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
- Tax: 20% of $30,000 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B:

- Annual pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Remaining pay after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax on remaining pay: 10% of $36,000 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:

- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:

$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate."
"First, we calculate the number of ruined castles by finding 40 percent of the total castles in Scotland:

\[ \text{Number of ruined castles} = 220 \times \frac{40}{100} = 220 \times 0.4 = 88 \]

Next, we find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned, which is half of the ruined castles:

\[ \text{Number of unmanned ruined castles} = 88 \times \frac{1}{2} = 44 \]

So, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is 44."
"To find the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total cost for each offer and then subtract one from the other.

For Furniture United:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

For Cozy Homes:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, we find the difference between the two total costs:
- Cost difference: $3,450 - $3,350 = $100

The cost difference between the two offers is $100."
"To find out how many guns each person would have if they shared them equally, we first need to calculate the total number of guns they have combined.

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, Richard has 5 guns, and Jason (RJ) has 1 gun. So, the total number of guns is:

\[ 8 + 10 + 5 + 1 = 24 \]

There are 4 people (DJ, Nick, Richard, and Jason), so we divide the total number of guns by 4 to find out how many each would have if shared equally:

\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

Each of them would have 6 guns if they shared their guns equally.

6"
"To find out how much sugar Mason needs, we can calculate the total amount of sugar required for the suckers and the fudge separately and then add them together.

For 8 batches of suckers:
- Each batch requires 30 ounces of sugar.
- So, for 8 batches, he needs \(8 \times 30 = 240\) ounces of sugar.

For 1 batch of fudge:
- Each batch requires 70 ounces of sugar.
- So, for 1 batch, he needs \(1 \times 70 = 70\) ounces of sugar.

Now, we add the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge:
- Total sugar needed = \(240 + 70 = 310\) ounces.

Therefore, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge."
"First, let's calculate the value of the shares after the first year. Maria initially buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the initial total value is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price per share after the increase, we calculate:

\[ \$8 \times 1.50 = \$12 \]

So, the value of the 8 shares after the first year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To find the new price per share after the decrease, we calculate:

\[ \$12 \times 0.75 = \$9 \]

So, the value of the 8 shares after the second year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72 \]

"Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate \(2 \times 3 = 6\) hot dogs.

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate \(6 \div 2 = 3\) hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate: \(3 - 2 = 1\).

John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke."
"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group will then have \( x - 10 \) students.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can write the equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group, therefore, has:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"To solve this problem, let's start by setting up some equations based on the information given.

Let \( C \) represent the number of cows and \( H \) represent the number of chickens. According to the problem, Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so we can write:
\[ H = 2C \]

We also know that the total number of animals is 60, so:
\[ C + H = 60 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know there are 20 cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times C) + (2 \times H) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times 20) + (2 \times 40) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

So, the animals on Farmer Brown's farm have a total of 160 legs."
"Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. After 4 weeks, he will be juggling:

3 (initial balls) + 4 (balls added each week for 4 weeks) = 7 balls

However, during the performance, he drops 3 balls. So, the number of balls he has left is:

7 (total balls) - 3 (dropped balls) = 4 balls

But 2 of those dropped balls are caught by people in the crowd, so he still has:

4 (remaining balls) - 2 (caught balls) = 2 balls

Therefore, Josh starts to juggle with 2 balls."
"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself.

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

The total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, plus the container itself, is 260 pounds."
"Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits.

At the baby shower, Laurel received twice that amount, which is \(2 \times 24 = 48\) baby outfits.

Then, Laurel's mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits.

\[24 + 48 + 15 = 87\]

So, Laurel has 87 baby outfits for her baby."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the additional distance Tyson should run each day according to his coach's advice.
2. Determine the total distance Tyson runs each day after following the coach's advice.
3. Calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month (assuming June has 30 days).

Step 1: Calculate the additional distance.
Tyson runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more. So, the additional distance is:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

Step 2: Determine the total distance Tyson runs each day after following the coach's advice.
\[ 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters per day} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month (30 days).
\[ 6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:
\[ 180000 \text{ meters} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
180000 meters"
"Juice Box A costs $4.

Juice Box B costs $4 + $5 = $9.

Juice Box C costs $4 + $7 = $11.

To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:

$11 - $9 = $2.

Juice Box C is $2 more than Juice Box B."
"To calculate the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have, we need to multiply the number of tables by the number of legs each type of table has and then add the results together.

For the 40 tables with 4 legs each:
40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs

For the 50 tables with 3 legs each:
50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs

Now, we add the two results together:
160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs

The total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Jenny's son takes for his lunch each week. Since he takes 4 cookies 5 days a week, that's:

\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cookies Jenny's husband eats in a week. Since he eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, that's:

\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 7 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Now, we add the cookies taken by her son and her husband to find out how many cookies are taken out of the bag each week:

\[ 20 \text{ cookies/week} + 7 \text{ cookies/week} = 27 \text{ cookies/week} \]

The bag contains 36 cookies, so the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat is:

\[ 36 \text{ cookies} - 27 \text{ cookies} = 9 \text{ cookies} \]

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount:

2 shirts * $30/shirt = $60

Now, let's calculate the discount amount:

40% of $60 = 0.40 * $60 = $24

Subtract the discount from the original total cost to find out how much Davos paid:

$60 - $24 = $36

Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts."
"To find out what percentage more the factory is making per day now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily revenue from tractors.
2. Calculate the daily revenue from silos.
3. Find the difference in daily revenue.
4. Calculate the percentage increase based on the original revenue.

**Step 1: Calculate the daily revenue from tractors.**
- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.
- Daily revenue from tractors = 10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day.

**Step 2: Calculate the daily revenue from silos.**
- They now sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.
- Daily revenue from silos = 5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day.

**Step 3: Find the difference in daily revenue.**
- Difference in daily revenue = Daily revenue from silos - Daily revenue from tractors
- Difference = $1100/day - $1000/day = $100/day.

**Step 4: Calculate the percentage increase.**
- Percentage increase = (Difference in daily revenue / Original daily revenue) * 100%
- Percentage increase = ($100/day / $1000/day) * 100% = 0.1 * 100% = 10%.

The factory is making 10% more per day now."
"To calculate the total amount Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to break down the costs for each item and then sum them up for a year.

1. **Food Cost:**
   - Food costs $25 per week.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month, so the monthly cost for food is \(25 \times 4 = 100\) dollars.
   - There are 12 months in a year, so the yearly cost for food is \(100 \times 12 = 1200\) dollars.

2. **Treats Cost:**
   - Treats cost $20 per month.
   - The yearly cost for treats is \(20 \times 12 = 240\) dollars.

3. **Medicine Cost:**
   - Medicine costs $100 per month.
   - The yearly cost for medicine is \(100 \times 12 = 1200\) dollars.

Now, we sum up all the yearly costs:
- Yearly cost for food: $1200
- Yearly cost for treats: $240
- Yearly cost for medicine: $1200

Total yearly cost = \(1200 + 240 + 1200 = 2640\) dollars.

Therefore, Madeline spends \(\boxed{2640}\) dollars on her dog per year."

"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming. He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Next, he watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is:

\[ 3 \times 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let's denote the total time spent on vacation as \( T \). Therefore, we have:

\[ 0.30T = 15 \text{ hours} \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ hours}}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. So, the time spent sightseeing is:

\[ 0.40 \times 50 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time John spent sightseeing is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Annabelle earns from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so:

\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much money she earns from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so:

\[ 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, let's add the money she already has in her savings, the money from her first job, and the money from her second job:

\[ 80 \, \text{dollars} + 200 \, \text{dollars} + 75 \, \text{dollars} = 355 \, \text{dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so the amount of money Annabelle still needs to save is:

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost for Morgan and her friends to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. Then, we'll subtract this total from her budget to see how much money is left for her friends.

1. **Cost of mini-golf for one person**: $5
2. **Cost of go-karts for one person (2 rides at $10 each)**: $10 * 2 = $20
3. **Total cost for one person (mini-golf + go-karts)**: $5 + $20 = $25
4. **Total cost for one person (mini-golf + go-karts + $5 in arcade tokens)**: $25 + $5 = $30

Now, let's subtract the cost for Morgan from the total budget to find out how much is left for her friends.

5. **Morgan's budget**: $90
6. **Cost for Morgan**: $30
7. **Money left for friends**: $90 - $30 = $60

Each friend will also need to cover the cost of $30 (mini-golf + go-karts + $5 in arcade tokens).

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount Billy spent on gumballs:**
   - Billy bought 40 gumballs, and each gumball costs $0.05.
   - Total cost for gumballs = 40 * $0.05 = $2.00.

2. **Calculate the change Billy had before buying gumballs:**
   - Billy initially had $10.
   - After buying gumballs, he spent $2.00.
   - Change before buying gumballs = $10 - $2.00 = $8.00.

3. **Determine the amount of money Billy had before spending on gumballs:**
   - Billy took half of his change to buy gumballs.
   - Therefore, the amount he had before buying gumballs = $8.00 * 2 = $16.00.

4. **Calculate the amount spent on candy:**
   - Total money Billy had initially = $10.
   - Money spent on gumballs = $2.00.
   - Money spent on candy = $16.00 - $2.00 = $14.00.

5. **Determine the amount of candy Billy bought:**
   - The cost of candy is $1.5 per pound.
   - Amount of candy bought = $14.00 / $1.5 per pound = 14 / 1.5 = 9.3333 pounds.

Since the amount of candy is typically measured in whole or half pounds in such problems, we can round to the nearest half pound if necessary, but the exact answer is:

Billy bought 9.3333 pounds of candy.

Final numerical answer:
9.3333 pounds"
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( S \).

According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. Carver is 45 years old, so we can write the equation as:

To find \( S \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 45 + 5 = 2S \]
\[ 50 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ S = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs, which is \(75 + 100 = 175\) miles. So, the distance from the third city to the first city is \(175 - 50 = 125\) miles.

Now, let's add up the distances for one complete trip:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily travel distance:
\[\frac{18000}{900} = 20 \text{ days}\]

So, the train goes 20 days between services.

"First, let's determine the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed. The collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. The average is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

So, a collie bed takes 5 pounds of stuffing.

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

For the chihuahua beds:
\[
4 \text{ beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per bed} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

For the collie beds:
\[
3 \text{ beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per bed} = 15 \text{ pounds}

The minimum number of points she must score on the third test to pass is 9."
"First, let's determine the number of people kicked out for shoplifting. We know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks. The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times that number minus 5. So, we calculate:

\[ 4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

Next, we calculate the number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. This number is three times the number of shoplifters:

\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we know the total number of people kicked out for the three specific reasons (refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence) is:

\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

Given that the total number of people kicked out is 50, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:

\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that after scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times more points than Sara.
2. Sara scored 8 points, so three times Sara's points would be \(3 \times 8 = 24\) points.
3. This means that after scoring 14 points, Erin has 24 points.
4. To find out how many points Erin had before scoring those 14 points, we subtract 14 from 24.

"To calculate the total cost for the senior gifts, we need to break down the expenses into different categories and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames for all seniors:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - There are 44 seniors.
   - Total cost for picture frames = 44 * $20 = $880.

2. **Cost of etching for all picture frames:**
   - The etching cost is 20% of the picture frame cost.
   - Etching cost per frame = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4.
   - Total etching cost = 44 * $4 = $176.

3. **Cost of pins for 2 seniors:**
   - Each pin costs $5.
   - Total cost for pins = 2 * $5 = $10.

4. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers.
   - Number of officers = 1/4 * 44 = 11.
   - Each cord costs $12.
   - Total cost for cords = 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of picture frames + Cost of etching + Cost of pins + Cost of cords
- Total cost = $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1,198.

The total amount spent on the senior gifts is $1,198."
"To find out how much Ethan would save by making his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate 20% of the market price and then subtract that from the original price.

\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday, which is:
\[ 14 \times 2 = 28 \text{ pairs} \]

On the last day of the sale, they sold one-half the amount that they did on Saturday, which is:
\[ 28 \div 2 = 14 \text{ pairs} \]

However, six pairs were returned because they didn't fit, so the actual number of pairs sold on the last day is:
\[ 14 - 6 = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

To find the total number of pairs sold during the sale, we add the pairs sold on each day:
\[ 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \text{ pairs} \]

Therefore, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is:
50 pairs.

Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is:
\[ 50 \times 2 = 100 \text{ shoes} \]

"The company bought equipment worth $400,000 in total. 40% of this equipment was faulty, so the value of the faulty equipment is:

40% of $400,000 = 0.40 * $400,000 = $160,000

This means the value of the functioning equipment is the total value minus the value of the faulty equipment:

$400,000 - $160,000 = $240,000

Therefore, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000."
"Mary has 30 sheep, half of which produce 1 kg of milk and the other half produce 2 kg of milk every day.

- Half of 30 sheep is 15 sheep.
- 15 sheep produce 1 kg of milk each, so that's 15 * 1 kg = 15 kg.
- The other 15 sheep produce 2 kg of milk each, so that's 15 * 2 kg = 30 kg.

Adding the milk from both groups of sheep:

15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg

Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. There are 40 pupils in total.
2. Half of the class likes blue, so \( \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \) pupils like blue.
3. The remaining pupils are \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).
4. One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so \( \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \) pupils like green.
5. The rest of the pupils like yellow, so the number of pupils who like yellow is \( 20 - 5 = 15 \).

Therefore, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is 15."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of apples sold on Monday:**
   - Lucy got $56 from selling the apples on Monday.
   - Each apple is sold for $4.
   - Therefore, the number of apples sold on Monday is \( \frac{56}{4} = 14 \) apples.

2. **Determine the number of apples picked on Tuesday:**
   - Lucy picked 12 apples on Tuesday.

3. **Determine the number of apples picked on Wednesday:**
   - Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday.
   - Therefore, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) apples.

4. **Calculate the total number of apples picked over the three days:**
   - Apples picked on Monday: 14
   - Apples picked on Tuesday: 12
   - Apples picked on Wednesday: 24
   - Total apples picked = \( 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 \)

Therefore, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is 50."
"Lindsay started with 50 socks. She washed 10 pairs of socks, which is 20 socks, and 15 loose socks. So, the total number of socks she washed is:

20 (from pairs) + 15 (loose) = 35 socks

To find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we subtract the number of socks she washed from the total number of socks she had:

50 (total socks) - 35 (washed socks) = 15 socks

Lindsay has missed 15 socks."
"Rachel initially had 23 cookies and Janet gave her 42 more. So, the total number of cookies Rachel had before her brother ate some is:

65 - 44 = 21 cookies

Therefore, Rachel has 21 cookies left."
"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest for the five months. The interest rate is 10% per year, so for five months, the interest rate is:

\[ \text{Interest for 5 months} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Annual Interest Rate} \times \left(\frac{\text{Number of Months}}{12}\right) \]
\[ \text{Interest for 5 months} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \left(\frac{5}{12}\right) \]
\[ \text{Interest for 5 months} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \]
\[ \text{Interest for 5 months} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \]
\[ \text{Interest for 5 months} = 152.085 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.085 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3802.085 \]

Now, to find out how much she has to pay per month, we divide the total amount by the number of months:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.085}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.417 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.42 \]

So, Karan has to pay $760.42 per month."
"To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Cho hiked = 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 km

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Chloe hiked = 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 km

Now, we find the difference in the distances they hiked:
Difference = Distance Cho hiked - Distance Chloe hiked
Difference = 112 km - 45 km = 67 km

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos.

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, which means she has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, which means she has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos they have together:

- Total silver pesos: \(50 + 100 = 150\)
- Total gold pesos: \(80 + 120 = 200\)

The total number of pesos they have together is \(150 + 200 = 350\).

"First, let's calculate the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She has 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, the total number of cups of lemonade is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost. Millie spent $18 on supplies. So, the total cost is:

\[ \$18 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she sells all the lemonade, we can determine the profit per hour by dividing the total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade. First, we find out how many hours it takes to sell all 36 cups:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we calculate the profit per hour:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

So, the profit Millie makes per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:

\[ \$2 \]"
"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he kept \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land. The amount of land he kept is given as 12.8 hectares.

So, we can write the equation as:
\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]
\[ x = 32 \]

Therefore, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 52 * 50% = 52 * 0.5 = 26

The performance is done by the female members, so initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform. However, on the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

Number of girls who can't make it = 26 * 0.5 = 13

So, the number of girls who actually perform is:

Number of girls who perform = 26 - 13 = 13

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Total number of people who sang = Number of girls who perform + Number of teachers = 13 + 3 = 16

To find the total number of messages delivered, we add the messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu:
\[ 66 + 22 = 88 \]

Therefore, the total number of messages James delivers is 88."
"To determine how much money David saves, let's break down the costs for both David and Dasha.

First, let's calculate the cost for Dasha:
- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, each ride costs \(2 \times 2 = $4\).
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \times 4 = $36\).

Now, let's calculate the cost for David:
- David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.
- Therefore, the total cost for David is $30.

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract the cost for David from the cost for Dasha:
- The savings for David is \(36 - 30 = $6\).

So, David saves $6."

- Gifts for her family: 6
- Gifts for her friends: 4
- Gifts for her teachers: 2

Total number of gifts = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to make bows for all 12 gifts. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each bow, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of gifts:

144 inches of ribbon ÷ 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given ratio and the total number of popsicles to find out how many popsicles each person has.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of popsicles is the sum of Betty's and Sam's popsicles, which is given as 165. So, we can write the equation:

\[5x + 6x = 165\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[11x = 165\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:

- Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles.
- Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

\[90 - 75 = 15\]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services before the bundle discount:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu costs $10 a month.
- Disney Plus costs $10 a month.

So, the total cost for these three services before the discount is:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount for bundling these services. The discount amount is:
\[ 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we compare this to the cost of the cable package, which is $60 per month. The savings by cancelling the cable package and subscribing to the streaming services is:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total time Carol spent on her work.

Carol spends 4 hours writing a song. Since she spends half that much time recording it, she spends \(4 \div 2 = 2\) hours recording. 

The time spent editing is given as 90 minutes. We need to convert this to hours to make the units consistent. \(90 \text{ minutes} = 90 \div 60 = 1.5 \text{ hours}\).

Now, let's add up all the time spent:
- Writing: 4 hours
- Recording: 2 hours
- Editing: 1.5 hours

Total time spent = \(4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5\) hours.

Next, we calculate the percentage of the total time spent editing. The time spent editing is 1.5 hours, and the total time is 7.5 hours. The percentage is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100 = 20\%

"First, let's calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when it is used for 8 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. So, for 8 hours, it uses:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the daily energy consumption to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Now, if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, the air conditioner will be used for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

The energy consumption for 3 hours a day is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

So, the total kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:
\[ 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]"

"To determine how much money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sandwiches needed to serve 20 people.
2. Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.
3. Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of sandwiches needed.**
Each sandwich serves 4 people. Therefore, the number of sandwiches needed for 20 people is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.**
Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of meat and cheese needed is:
\[ 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of meat per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \]
\[ 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of cheese per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese.**
The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, and the cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound. Therefore, the total cost for the meat and cheese is:
\[ 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \times \$7.00 \text{ per pound} = \$35.00 \]
\[ 5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \times \$3.00 \text{ per pound} = \$15.00 \]

"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis.
2. He has a total of 40 cannolis.
3. He bought 60 more cannolis at the store.
4. He bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought.

Let's calculate the number of corns and cannolis Allan has after the purchases:

- Initial number of cannolis: 40
- Additional cannolis bought: 60
- Total cannolis: 40 + 60 = 100

Since Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis initially, the initial number of corns is:
- Initial number of corns: 2 * 40 = 80

After buying 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought (60), the number of corns he bought is:
- Corns bought: 60 - 40 = 20

So, the total number of corns after the purchase is:
- Total corns: 80 + 20 = 100

Now, we can find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis:
- Combined total: 100 (corns) + 100 (cannolis) = 200

Final numerical answer:

- Steps from the short walk with his friend: 1,000

Total steps before the jog: 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000

Since he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps, the steps he took during his jog would be:

10,000 (total goal) - 6,000 (steps before jog) - 2,000 (steps left) = 2,000 steps

Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog."
"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:

\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we determine how long it will take Toby to read the book at his reading rate of 300 words per minute:

\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to leave, and it takes him 30 minutes to read the book. After reading, he needs to travel to the airport, which takes 10 minutes. So, the total time he will spend is:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes (reading)} + 10 \text{ minutes (travel)} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he has 60 minutes before he needs to leave, the time he will be early is:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total payment for May.
2. Determine the number of employees remaining after June.
3. Calculate the total payment for June.
4. Sum the payments from May and June.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**

- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment for May = Number of employees × Hourly wage × Hours worked per week
\[ 40 \times 15 \times 40 = 24000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of employees remaining after June.**

- 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired in June.
- Number of employees who left = 1/4 × 40 = 10
- Number of employees remaining = 40 - 10 = 30

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for June.**

- Number of employees in June: 30
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment for June = Number of employees × Hourly wage × Hours worked per week
\[ 30 \times 15 \times 40 = 18000 \]

**Step 4: Sum the payments from May and June.**

Total payment for May and June = Payment for May + Payment for June
\[ 24000 + 18000 = 42000 \]

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $42,000."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. So, the first pound of taffy costs $3, and the second pound is half off, which means it costs $3 / 2 = $1.50. Therefore, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashell bag, which is $1.50.

Then, we calculate the cost of the 4 magnets, each costing $0.25. So, the total cost for the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Taffy: $4.50
- Seashell bag: $1.50
- Magnets: $1.00

Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

Sally started with $10.00. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is:
$10.00 - $7.00 = $3.00

Therefore, Sally has $3.00 left."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the second pack of fireworks. Since it's worth twice the amount of the first pack, which is $400, the second pack costs:

\[ 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

Next, we add the cost of the first and second packs of fireworks:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Now, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the first and second packs. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the original price. So, we calculate 80% of $1200:

\[ 1200 \times 0.80 = 960 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted total:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. To find out how many cookies she needs for 30 days, we multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of days:

\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies she needs to make 60 cookies:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

5 dozens"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the problem does not provide a direct percentage for candles that explode. Instead, it gives us a guarantee that the candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which implies that 1% of the candles might explode.

Given that 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog, we can assume that the 1% that might explode are part of the more dangerous candles. Therefore, we can calculate the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and might explode as follows:

1. Calculate the number of candles that might explode:
\[ 1\% \text{ of } 50000 = \frac{1}{100} \times 50000 = 500 \]

2. Calculate the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and might explode:
\[ 5\% \text{ of the 500 more dangerous candles} = \frac{5}{100} \times 500 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and might explode is 25."
"First, we need to calculate the discount price of each blouse. Since the blouses are on a 30% off rack, we subtract 30% from the regular price of $20.

The discount amount per blouse is:
\[ 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

So, the discounted price per blouse is:
\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost for the 4 blouses is:
\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
\[ 56 \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples.
3. Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees, but we don't know the exact number yet. Let's call this number \(x\).

Joanne's total apples = \(30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\).

Joanne's sister gathers:
- Twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
- Three times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
- No apples from the average trees.

Joanne's sister's total apples = \(60 + 45 = 105\).

The combined total of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500 apples. So, we can set up the equation:

\[45 + x + 105 = 500\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[150 + x = 500\]

Subtract 150 from both sides to solve for \(x\):

\[x = 500 - 150\]
\[x = 350\]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

**Final numerical answer: 350**"
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of heads is 180, which means \( C + D = 180 \).
2. The total number of bumps (humps) is 304, which means \( 2C + D = 304 \) because camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump.

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can express \( D \) from the first equation:
\[ D = 180 - C \]

Next, we substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[ 2C + (180 - C) = 304 \]
\[ 2C + 180 - C = 304 \]
\[ C + 180 = 304 \]
\[ C = 304 - 180 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we have \( C = 124 \), we can find \( D \):
\[ D = 180 - C \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

Final numerical answer:
56"
"First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days. He traveled 200 kilometers each day for 4 days, so the total distance for the first 4 days is:

\[ 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we need to find out how far he traveled over the next two days, which was 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. So, we calculate 30% of 800 km:

\[ 0.30 \times 800 \, \text{km} = 240 \, \text{km} \]

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is 0 km.

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, so the total distance for the second week is:

\[ 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we add up all the distances to find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip:

\[ 800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} = 3140 \, \text{km} \]

So, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:

\[ 3140 \, \text{km} \]"
"Given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4.

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.

\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to determine the elevation of the comb and then calculate the difference between that elevation and Oliver's current elevation.

1. Stanley's comb fell 4,000 feet from his starting elevation of 10,000 feet. So, the comb's elevation is:
   \[
   10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb's elevation, we subtract Oliver's current elevation from the comb's elevation:
   \[
   6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To determine how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money given by the second bank.
2. Add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital.

The first bank gave Mr. Josue $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so the second bank gave him:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Now, we add the amounts from both banks to his initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has \(\boxed{17000}\) in capital."
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so the total number of cats carried away by the boats is:

4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats

After the boats took away the cats, the number of cats left on the rock is:

50 cats - 20 cats = 30 cats

Then, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. The number of cats that ran after the mouse is:

(3/5) * 30 cats = 18 cats

So, the number of cats left on the rock is:

30 cats - 18 cats = 12 cats

Final numerical answer:

"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into the different pricing periods.

1. **First 6 months at $8 a month:**
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 a month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96

"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The problem states that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out the total savings Cole made. The problem states that Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can set up the following equations:

Let \( S_{tattered} \) be the savings from the tattered jeans and \( S_{jogger} \) be the savings from the jogger jeans. We know:

\[ S_{tattered} + S_{jogger} = 6 \]
\[ S_{jogger} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
\[ S_{tattered} = 6 - 2 = 4 \]

The original price of the tattered jeans is $28, and Cole saved $4 on them, so the sale price of the tattered jeans is:

\[ 28 - 4 = 24 \]

The original price of the jogger jeans is $22, and Cole saved $2 on them, so the sale price of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 22 - 2 = 20 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:

\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles.

First, let's calculate the capacity of the buses:
4 buses * 60 employees per bus = 240 employees

Next, the capacity of the minibusses:
6 minibusses * 30 employees per minibus = 180 employees

And the capacity of the minivans:
10 minivans * 15 employees per minivan = 150 employees

Now, we add all these capacities together to get the total number of employees that can join the day trip:
240 employees (from buses) + 180 employees (from minibusses) + 150 employees (from minivans) = 570 employees

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Lillian builds 3 bird feeders.
- She buys 3 bird feeders.
- Each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds.
- Each homemade feeder attracts 10 more birds than a store-bought feeder, so each homemade feeder attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds.

Now, let's calculate the total number of birds attracted by each type of feeder:

- For the 3 store-bought feeders: 3 feeders * 20 birds/feeder = 60 birds.
- For the 3 homemade feeders: 3 feeders * 30 birds/feeder = 90 birds.

Adding these together gives the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day:

60 birds (from store-bought feeders) + 90 birds (from homemade feeders) = 150 birds.

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day."
"To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. **Bagel Cost**: The bagel costs $4.

2. **Soup Cost**: The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find the cost of the soup, we calculate 25% of $4 and add it to the original price of the bagel.
   - 25% of $4 = 0.25 * $4 = $1
   - Therefore, the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.

3. **Cake Cost**: The cake is half the price of the bagel.
   - Half of $4 = $4 / 2 = $2

Now, we sum up the costs of the soup, bagel, and cake to find the total cost of the dinner.
- Total cost = Cost of soup + Cost of bagel + Cost of cake
- Total cost = $5 + $4 + $2 = $11

Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money Kenny has after selling his cards:**
   - Kenny has $50 in spending cash and the ticket to the amusement park costs $100.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money he has after buying the ticket is $50 + $100 = $150.

2. **Calculate the number of cards sold:**
   - Kenny sells each card for $1.5.
   - To find out how many cards he sold, we divide the total amount of money by the price per card: $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards.

3. **Determine the total number of cards he started with:**
   - Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells the rest.
   - Let's denote the total number of cards he started with as \( x \).
   - He keeps 1/3 of them, so he sells 2/3 of them.
   - We know that 2/3 of the cards equals 100 cards (the number of cards he sold).
   - Therefore, we can set up the equation: \(\frac{2}{3}x = 100\).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get: \( x = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150 \).

So, Kenny started with 150 cards."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation**: The caterer prepared enough hot dogs for half of the 36 guests to have two hot dogs each. So, half of 36 is 18 guests. This means 18 guests would get 2 hot dogs each, which totals 36 hot dogs for these guests.

2. **Total Hot Dogs Needed**: Since 40 guests showed up and everyone wanted a second hot dog, we need to calculate the total number of hot dogs required. Each of the 40 guests would need 2 hot dogs, so the total number of hot dogs needed is \(40 \times 2 = 80\) hot dogs.

3. **Hot Dogs Available**: The caterer initially prepared 36 hot dogs for the first 18 guests. Since 40 guests showed up, and the caterer only prepared 36 hot dogs, the number of hot dogs left for the additional 22 guests (40 - 18) is \(80 - 36 = 44\) hot dogs.

4. **Hot Dogs for Second Hot Dog**: Out of the 44 hot dogs available for the additional 22 guests, each of these 22 guests would need 1 more hot dog to have a second one. So, 22 hot dogs are needed for the second hot dog for these guests.

5. **Hot Dogs Left**: After giving the second hot dog to 22 guests, the number of hot dogs left is \(44 - 22 = 22\) hot dogs.

6. **Guests Without Second Hot Dog**: Since 22 guests were given a second hot dog, the remaining \(40 - 22 = 18\) guests did not get a second hot dog.

**Final Answer**: 18 guests did not get a second hot dog."
"Indras' name has 6 letters.

Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3 letters.

"First, we need to determine how much gasoline is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needs in gallons. Josey needs \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons by 8:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"First, let's calculate how much money George had left after his purchase. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Money left} = 5 \times \frac{1}{100} = 0.05 \]

So, George spent:

\[ 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the 3 bags of chips:

Now, we subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars:

\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we divide the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar to find the number of candy bars:

\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"

"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area of the room to find the width. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the room. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:

\[ \boxed{98 \text{ feet}} \]"
"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we first need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

Elizabeth's total beads:
1 pack of red + 2 packs of clear = 1 + 2 = 3 packs
3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads

Margareth's total beads:
3 packs of blue + 4 packs of red = 3 + 4 = 7 packs
7 packs * 20 beads/pack = 140 beads

Now, we find the difference in the number of beads:
Margareth's beads - Elizabeth's beads = 140 - 60 = 80 beads

One sister has 80 more beads than the other.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking**: Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour.
   - Temperature increase per hour = 5 degrees
   - Total hours baking = 3
   - Total temperature increase = 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees
   - New temperature after baking = 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

3. **Cooling**: Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   - Cooling rate = 2 degrees/10 minutes
   - Total time the window is open = 30 minutes
   - Total cooling = (2 degrees/10 minutes) * 30 minutes = 6 degrees
   - Final temperature = 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

The house's final temperature is 49 degrees."
"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon:

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time James took for the swim is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so:

\[ 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's:

\[ 170 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we can find out how long it took James to do the run by subtracting the time he took for the swim and the bike from his total time:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} - 85 \text{ minutes} = 59 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it took James 59 minutes to do the run."
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is:

\[ 1.25 \times 60 = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so:

\[ \text{Length of Movie B} = 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, so:

\[ \text{Length of Movie A} = \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Movie A was 20 minutes long."
"First, let's determine how far the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the distance the horse runs is:
\[ 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate how much hay the horse eats. For every mile, the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse eats:
\[ 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails of hay} \]

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost for 8 bails of hay is:
\[ 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

The change Michael gets after buying the hay is:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \text{ dollars} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has:

- She uses 4 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen equals \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs.
- She also uses 2 additional eggs.

So, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Since each glass requires 5 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 5:

\[
\frac{50}{5} = 10 \text{ glasses}
\]

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays she can put out:

\[
\frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ trays}
\]

Therefore, Rozanne can put out 2 trays."
"To determine by how many points Joey is now winning, we need to calculate the total points for both Joey and Marcy after their respective turns and then find the difference between their scores.

First, let's calculate Joey's total points:
- Joey starts with 214 points.
- He scores an additional 26 points.
- Therefore, Joey's total points are \(214 + 26 = 240\).

Next, let's calculate Marcy's total points:
- Marcy starts with 225 points.
- She scores an additional 10 points.
- Therefore, Marcy's total points are \(225 + 10 = 235\).

Now, we find the difference between Joey's and Marcy's total points to determine by how many points Joey is winning:
- Joey's total points: 240
- Marcy's total points: 235
- The difference is \(240 - 235 = 5\).

So, Joey is now winning by \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"To calculate the salesman's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per sneaker.
2. Calculate the total revenue from the flash sale.
3. Calculate the total revenue from the department store.
4. Calculate the total revenue.
5. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost per sneaker.**

The total cost for the case of sneakers is $576, and there are 48 sneakers in the case. So, the cost per sneaker is:
\[ \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from the flash sale.**

The salesman sold 17 sneakers at $20 each. So, the revenue from the flash sale is:
\[ \text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from the department store.**

The salesman sold the remaining sneakers (48 - 17 = 31) at $25 each. So, the revenue from the department store is:
\[ \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total revenue.**

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the revenue from the department store:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 5: Calculate the profit.**

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ \text{Profit} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the salesman's profit is:
\[ \boxed{539} \]"
"To find the total number of crayons Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of crayons in each type of packet and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets that each contain 8 pieces:
\[ 6 \text{ packets} \times 8 \text{ crayons per packet} = 48 \text{ crayons} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of crayons in the four packets that each contain 16 pieces:
\[ 4 \text{ packets} \times 16 \text{ crayons per packet} = 64 \text{ crayons} \]

Now, we add the two totals together to find the overall number of crayons:
\[ 48 \text{ crayons} + 64 \text{ crayons} = 112 \text{ crayons} \]

Therefore, the total number of crayons Beatrice bought is:
\[ 112 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Super Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $20
   - Popcorn with soda: $1 extra
   - Total cost with super ticket: $20 + $1 = $21

2. **Regular Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $12
   - Popcorn and soda at regular price
   - Given: Soda costs $3
   - Let the regular price of popcorn be \( P \)
   - Total cost with regular ticket: $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \)

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - Therefore, the cost of the regular ticket option minus the cost of the super ticket option equals $2.
   - \( (15 + P) - 21 = 2 \)

4. **Solve for \( P \):**
   - \( 15 + P - 21 = 2 \)
   - \( P - 6 = 2 \)
   - \( P = 8 \)

The regular price of popcorn is $8.

**Final numerical answer:**

"First, let's determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the initial day. Given that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900, we can calculate the cost per balloon as follows:

\[ \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{\$900}{20} = \$45 \]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = \$45 + \$20 = \$65 \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost for Bentley to fill 170 balloons at the new price:

\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times \$65 = \$11,050 \]

So, Bentley paid \(\$11,050\) to fill 170 balloons after the price increase."
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

1. For the first part of the trip:
   - Speed = 60 mph
   - Time = 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles

2. For the second part of the trip:
   - Speed = 30 mph
   - Time = 1 hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 1 hour = 30 miles

3. Total distance traveled = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

4. Total time taken = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

5. Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."

- \(8 - 3 = 5\) sapphires
- \(0 + 2 = 2\) rubies

The value of her sapphires is:
- \(5 \times 800 = 4000\) dollars

The value of her rubies is:
- \(2 \times 1200 = 2400\) dollars

The total value of all her jewels is:
- \(4000 + 2400 = 6400\) dollars

Therefore, the total value of all her jewels is 6400 dollars."
"Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. 

In 30 days, Marin will eat \(4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples}\).

Similarly, Nancy will eat \(4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples}\).

Together, they will eat \(120 \text{ apples} + 120 \text{ apples} = 240 \text{ apples}\) in 30 days.

"First, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed. The volume of a raised bed is given by its width, length, and height. Each raised bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet tall, so the volume of one raised bed is:

\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume of soil} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost of the potting soil is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{\$/bag} = 1920 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, the potting soil will cost Bob $1920."
"First, let's calculate the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can find the number of green cards by calculating 60% of the number of red cards and adding that to the number of red cards.

Number of red cards = 15
60% of 15 = 0.60 * 15 = 9

So, the number of green cards is:
15 (red cards) + 9 (60% more) = 24 green cards

Next, we calculate the number of yellow cards. The problem states that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards.

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24 = 39

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards together.

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

Therefore, the total number of cards of all mentioned colors is 78."
"Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. After twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies, which is 50 / 2 = 25 fairies, join the group. So, the total number of fairies became 50 + 25 = 75 fairies. Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. Therefore, the remaining number of fairies is 75 - 30 = 45 fairies.

45"
"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

Total number of puppies = 8 (Jennifer's) + 12 (Brandon's) = 20 puppies
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 (Jennifer's) + 4 (Brandon's) = 7 puppies

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.35 \times 100 = 35\% \]

Therefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots."
"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to make, we first need to calculate the total weight of all the feed he is buying.

1. **Hay**: 42 bales at 75 pounds each
   \[
   42 \times 75 = 3150 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Oats**: 20 sacks at 65 pounds each
   \[
   20 \times 65 = 1300 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Carrots**: 4 bags at 12 pounds each
   \[
   4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Sugar cubes**: 2 boxes at 1 pound each
   \[
   2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Now, we add up all the weights to find the total weight of the feed:
\[
3150 + 1300 + 48 + 2 = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:
\[
\frac{4500}{2250} = 2
\]

Therefore, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."
"Grayson recycles 3 aluminum cans and 5 plastic bottles each week. 

For the aluminum cans:
3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week

For the plastic bottles:
5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week

Total earnings per week:
6 cents (from cans) + 15 cents (from bottles) = 21 cents/week

For a four-week month:
21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents

Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month."
"First, let's determine how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

\[ \text{Toni's plants} = \text{Frederick's plants} + 0.60 \times \text{Frederick's plants} \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 0.60 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 16 \]

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate the number of plants Shondra has as follows:

\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = \text{Toni's plants} - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 16 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 9 \]

Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants."

"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, so we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet to match the unit of the shark's body length. There are 12 inches in a foot.

Each remora is 6 inches long, which is \( \frac{6}{12} = 0.5 \) feet long.

Since there are 2 remoras, the combined length of the remoras is \( 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \) foot.

The shark's body length is 10 feet.

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home. This means that one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers.

So, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{4}x = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

\[
x = 20 \times 4 = 80

Therefore, the total number of students at that grade level is 80."
"To break in the new pair of shoes, Jason needs to walk a total of 240 minutes. He plans to walk 4 days a week to achieve this goal in three weeks.

First, calculate the total number of days he will walk:
\[ 4 \text{ days/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Next, divide the total minutes needed by the total number of days to find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{12 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ minutes/day} \]

So, Jason has to spend 20 minutes walking each day."
"To find out how many books each child received, we first need to determine the total number of books Sarah bought. We can do this by dividing the total amount spent by the price per book.

Total amount spent: $300
Price per book: $15

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Price per book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Now, we need to divide the total number of books equally among her 4 kids.

Number of books each child gets = Total number of books / Number of kids
Number of books each child gets = 20 / 4
Number of books each child gets = 5

Each child got 5 books."
"To find out how many kids aren't allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to first determine how many kids are allergic to at least one of the substances (dairy or peanuts).

Let's denote:
- \(D\) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \(P\) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

We are given:
- \(|D| = 9\)
- \(|P| = 6\)
- \(|D \cap P| = 3\)
- Total number of kids in the class, \(|U| = 32\)

The number of kids allergic to at least one of the substances is given by:
\[|D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P|\]

Substituting the given values:
\[|D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12\]

This means 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances. To find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to at least one substance from the total number of kids in the class:
\[32 - 12 = 20\]

Therefore, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is:
20"
"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to add the number of employees to the number of tour guides.

First, calculate the total number of employees:
- There are 3 groups of 200 employees each.
- Total employees = 3 groups * 200 employees/group = 600 employees.

Next, calculate the total number of tour guides:
- Each group has 7 tour guides.
- Total tour guides = 3 groups * 7 tour guides/group = 21 tour guides.

Now, add the total number of employees and tour guides to get the total number of people going on the tour:
- Total people = Total employees + Total tour guides = 600 + 21 = 621.

The total number of people going on this tour is 621."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel during the busy weekend. The normal price is $1500 per day, and it is 20% more expensive during the busy weekend.

The increase in price is:
\[ 1500 \times 0.20 = 300 \]

So, the cost per day during the busy weekend is:
\[ 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, so for two people, it is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Adding the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel together gives the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

So, the total cost of the trip is:
\[ \boxed{15400} \]"
"Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint.

Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, which means:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ tubes of blue paint} \]

Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, which means:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ tubes of yellow paint} \]

To find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we add the tubes of blue and yellow paint together:
\[ 2 + 9 = 11 \]

Jasper has 11 tubes of paint."
"The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains. 

The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. So, we calculate the weight of the 2010 penny as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \text{ grains} = 36 \text{ grains} \]

Now, to find the combined weight of the two pennies, we add the weight of the 1959 penny and the 2010 penny:

\[ \text{Combined weight} = 48 \text{ grains} + 36 \text{ grains} = 84 \text{ grains} \]

The combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains."
"To find out how much more Keegan and Tashay need to earn to reach their goal, we first add the amounts they have already earned:

Keegan's earnings: $83
Tashay's earnings: $91

Total earnings by 3 pm: $83 + $91 = $174

Their goal is $200, so we subtract the total earnings from the goal to find out how much more they need:

$200 - $174 = $26

They need to earn $26 more to reach their goal."
"Gabriel has 20 songs on his player. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, which means Luri has \(3 \times 20 = 60\) songs on his player.

The maximum capacity of each player is 100 songs. Therefore, the number of songs Gabriel can still add to his player is \(100 - 20 = 80\) songs.

Similarly, the number of songs Luri can still add to his player is \(100 - 60 = 40\) songs.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add to his player than Gabriel can add to his, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:

\(80 - 40 = 40\)

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his."
"First, we need to determine how many oranges Stetson ate. Since he ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 oranges they picked, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. Since he agreed to give $10 for each orange he eats, the total amount of money he gave up is:

\[
24 \times 10 = 240
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is $240."
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we start by identifying the cost of her shoes, which is given as $80. The problem states that the handbag costs $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes.

First, we calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes:
\[ 3 \times 80 = 240 \]

Next, we subtract $20 from this amount to find the cost of the handbag:
\[ 240 - 20 = 220 \]

Therefore, the cost of Jillian's handbag is $220."
"James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week. 

First, calculate the total miles he runs in a week:
\[ 12 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 60 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, since he runs at a pace of 10 miles per hour, we can find the total hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles by his speed:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, James runs a total of 6 hours a week."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the daily consumption of oats for one horse:**
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, the daily consumption for one horse is \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).

2. **Determine the daily consumption of oats for all four horses:**
   - Since there are four horses, the total daily consumption is \(10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).

3. **Determine the total consumption of oats for five days:**
   - The total consumption for five days is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).

4. **Determine the number of bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.
   - The number of bags needed is \(\frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags}\).

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days."
"First, we calculate the number of Pomeranians Jana has. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can find this number by calculating two thirds of 27:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 27 = 18
\]

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians.

Next, we need to find out how many of these Pomeranians are girls. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, so we calculate one third of 18:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
\]

Therefore, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

"To find the average highest temperature of these three countries, we first need to sum the highest temperatures and then divide by the number of countries.

The highest temperatures are:
- Southlandia: -48°F
- Northlandia: 21°F
- Midlandia: -3°F

Sum of the highest temperatures:
-48 + 21 + (-3) = -30°F

Now, we divide the sum by the number of countries, which is 3:
-30 / 3 = -10°F

The average highest temperature of these three countries is -10°F."
"To find out how many days it will take the child to save the remaining amount of money, we first need to calculate the remaining amount he needs to save.

The toy car costs $12, and the child already has $4 saved. So, the remaining amount he needs to save is:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

The child promises to save $2 daily from his allowance. To find out how many days it will take to save the remaining $8, we divide the remaining amount by the daily savings:

\[ 8 \div 2 = 4 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each tray can hold 24 eggs.
2. Jaime has 2 trays, so the total capacity of the trays is \(24 \times 2 = 48\) eggs.
3. Jaime has 64 eggs in total.

Now, to find out how many eggs won't be able to be placed on the tray, we subtract the total capacity of the trays from the total number of eggs:

\[64 - 48 = 16\]

So, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the tray."
"To find out how much Sally spends in all, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza and then add it to the cost of the small pizza.

1. The cost of the small pizza is $8.
2. The family-size pizza costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, so:
   \[ \text{Cost of family-size pizza} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

3. Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent:
   \[ \text{Total cost} = 8 + 24 = 32 \]

Sally spends a total of $32."
"First, let's calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors before any discounts:

- Each pack costs $4.00.
- Therefore, 2 packs cost $4.00 * 2 = $8.00.

Now, let's apply the ""buy one get one free"" sale. Since Heather is buying 2 packs, she gets the second pack free. So, she only pays for 1 pack:

- Cost for 1 pack = $4.00.

Next, we apply the $2.00 coupon:

- Cost after coupon = $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Now, we need to find the cost per razor. Each pack contains 4 razors, and she is buying 2 packs, which means she is getting 8 razors in total:

- Total cost for 8 razors = $2.00.
- Cost per razor = $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.25 to cents:

- $0.25 = 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor is 25 cents."
"To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to identify the height of the shortest cheerleader, as she will be at the top of the pyramid. According to the problem, 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, and the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall. Therefore, the shortest cheerleader is 60 inches tall.

The height of the human pyramid is simply the height of the shortest cheerleader, which is 60 inches.

60 inches

Since the question asks for the height in feet, we need to convert 60 inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

60 inches ÷ 12 inches/foot = 5 feet

5 feet"
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour. Since she works 8 hours a day, she walks:

\[ 5 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \]

After 5 days, the total time she has walked is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, after 5 days at the office, Charisma has walked 200 minutes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be \(14 + 4 = 18\) years old.
3. At that time, Angela will be three times Brett's current age. Brett's current age is 14, so three times that is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

So, in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. To find out how old Angela is right now, we subtract 4 years from 42:

\[42 - 4 = 38\]

Angela is currently 38 years old.

**Angela is 38 years old.**"
"Paul drives his car twice a day for 14 days. 

For the morning rides, he spends $6 each day, so for 14 days, he spends:
\[ 6 \times 14 = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

For the afternoon rides, he spends $2 each day, so for 14 days, he spends:
\[ 2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the costs of the morning and afternoon rides together, the total amount spent is:
\[ 84 + 28 = 112 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Paul spent a total of $112 on driving his car during these two weeks."
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, let's find the total number of oranges both brought together:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges, we can calculate the number of pies they can make by dividing the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, they can make 40 Greek orange pies."
"To find the number of guests at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests as \( x \).

For the first venue, the total cost is the flat fee plus the cost of food:
\[ \text{Cost}_1 = 200 + 5x \]

For the second venue, the total cost is the cost per person for the venue plus the cost of food, but since the food is already included, the cost is just the cost per person for the venue:
\[ \text{Cost}_2 = 25x \]

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( \boxed{10} \)."
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \(D\), by Lily as \(L\), and by Bodhi as \(B\).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \(L + D + B = 43\)
2. \(L = D + 7\)
3. \(D = \frac{1}{2}B\)

First, we can express \(B\) in terms of \(D\) using the third equation:
\[B = 2D\]

Now, we can substitute \(L\) and \(B\) in terms of \(D\) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]
\[ 4D = 36 \]
\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know \(D = 9\), we can find \(L\) and \(B\):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Lily found \(16\) insects.

Lily found 16 insects."
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the amount of yarn each of them used and then add those amounts together.

First, let's calculate the amount of yarn Mariah used:
Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, Mariah used:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the amount of yarn Mariah's grandma used:
Her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein of yarn. So, she used:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we add the amounts of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma to find the total amount of yarn used:
\[ 91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, they used 273 yards of yarn altogether."
"To find out how many gifts Cherrie bought in total, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Gifts for the first 2 friends**: Each of these 2 friends wants 5 gifts.
   - Total gifts for these 2 friends = 2 friends * 5 gifts/friend = 10 gifts

2. **Gifts for the next 3 friends**: Each of these 3 friends wants 2 gifts.
   - Total gifts for these 3 friends = 3 friends * 2 gifts/friend = 6 gifts

3. **Additional random gifts**: Cherrie decides to buy 10 more random gifts.
   - Additional gifts = 10 gifts

Now, we add all these together to find the total number of gifts:

- Total gifts = Gifts for the first 2 friends + Gifts for the next 3 friends + Additional random gifts
- Total gifts = 10 + 6 + 10 = 26

Therefore, Cherrie bought a total of 26 gifts."
"Given that the chair is 3 feet wide, we can determine the width of the rug and then use that to find the length of the couch.

1. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair.
   - Width of the rug = Width of the chair + 5 feet
   - Width of the rug = 3 feet + 5 feet
   - Width of the rug = 8 feet

2. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug.
   - Length of the couch = 2 * Width of the rug + 2 feet
   - Length of the couch = 2 * 8 feet + 2 feet
   - Length of the couch = 16 feet + 2 feet
   - Length of the couch = 18 feet

The couch is 18 feet long."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. Two of those packs are strawberry.
3. One pack is grape, which costs $2.
4. One pack is green apple, which costs half as much as the grape pack, so it costs $1.
5. The total cost of all the packs is $7.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

The total cost can be represented as:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

Each pack of strawberry gum costs $2."

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the price per pair of snowshoes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
- Each dog has 4 legs.
- Mario has 6 dogs.
- Total number of legs = 6 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 24 legs.

Step 2: Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
- Each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs.
- Number of pairs of snowshoes = 24 legs / 2 legs/pair = 12 pairs.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the price per pair of snowshoes.
- Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
- Total cost = 12 pairs * $12.00/pair = $144.00.

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $144.00."
"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass and then subtract the cost of the weekly pass.

First, let's calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass:
- Each bus trip costs $2.20.
- She takes two bus trips a day.
- She does this five days a week.

So, the cost per day is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times \$2.20 \text{ per trip} = \$4.40 \text{ per day} \]

And the cost for five days is:
\[ \$4.40 \text{ per day} \times 5 \text{ days} = \$22.00 \]

"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. According to the problem:

1. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
2. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.

From point 1, if the farm has 30 cows, then the zoo should have half as many cows, which is not directly relevant to the number of sheep and cows we are given.

From point 2, if the zoo has 20 sheep, then the farm should have half as many sheep, which is 10 sheep.

Now, let's sum up the animals:

- The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 20 sheep + (unknown number of cows, but not needed for the total) = 20 sheep (since the number of cows in the zoo is not given and not needed for the total).

So, the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo combined is:

40 (from the farm) + 20 (from the zoo) = 60 animals.

60 animals"
"Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought, we can determine the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought by dividing the quantities Rose bought by 4.

For onions:
\[ \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

For potatoes:
\[ \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:

"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 lbs.
2. Determine the number of days Andy has to achieve this goal.
3. Calculate the daily calorie deficit required.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of calories to burn**

Andy wants to lose 30 lbs. and needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 lb. Therefore, the total number of calories he needs to burn is:
\[ 30 \text{ lbs} \times 3500 \text{ calories/lb} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of days**

Today is December 31st, and Andy's birthday is July 19th. The number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July (up to the 19th): 19 days

Adding these up:
\[ 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190 \text{ days} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the daily calorie deficit**

To find out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day, we divide the total number of calories by the number of days:
\[ \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{190 \text{ days}} \approx 552.63 \text{ calories/day} \]

Therefore, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 553 calories to reach his goal."
"Gerald earns $30 every day. Since he worked for an entire week, he worked for 7 days. 

To find out how much he earned in total for the week, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days he worked:
\[ 30 \times 7 = 210 \]

Gerald spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:
\[ 210 - 100 = 110 \]

Therefore, Gerald has $110 left."
"First, we need to calculate the total distance Hannah will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she runs 8 laps, we can find the total distance by multiplying the number of laps by the distance per lap:

\[ 8 \text{ laps} \times 0.25 \text{ km/lap} = 2 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to determine how much water Hannah needs to drink for the total distance. Since she needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs, we can find the total amount of water by multiplying the total distance by the amount of water per kilometer:

\[ 2 \text{ km} \times 60 \text{ ml/km} = 120 \text{ ml} \]

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water."
"First, let's calculate how much Julie spent on clothes. She spent 20% of $500 on clothes:

\[ 20\% \times 500 = 0.20 \times 500 = 100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on clothes. Now, let's find out how much money she had left after buying clothes:

\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs:

\[ 25\% \times 400 = 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on CDs. Now, let's find out how much money she had left after buying CDs:

\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

Therefore, Julie had $300 left."
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost is $90,000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags that Tara bought. She bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, at $4 per pack. So, the total cost is:

\[ 8 \text{ packs} \times \$4 \text{ per pack} = \$32 \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the bags. Tara sold each of the 40 bags (8 packs \(\times\) 5 bags per pack) for $8 each. So, the total revenue is:

\[ 40 \text{ bags} \times \$8 \text{ per bag} = \$320 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$320 - \$32 = \$288 \]

Therefore, the profit Tara earned on her bags is:

\[ \$288 \]"
"To find out how many punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total time he spent throwing punches and then multiply that by the rate at which he throws punches.

1. Calculate the total time of the fight:
   - Each round lasts 3 minutes.
   - There are 5 rounds.
   - Total time = 3 minutes/round * 5 rounds = 15 minutes.

2. Calculate the total number of punches:
   - Joe throws 25 punches per minute.
   - Total time = 15 minutes.
   - Total punches = 25 punches/minute * 15 minutes = 375 punches.

Therefore, Joe threw 375 punches."
"Suzanne made 36 cookies. 

Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, so:
\[ \text{Cookies made by Josh} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9 \]

Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, so:
\[ \text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially.

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. So, the total amount from the $10 bills is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount from the $20 bills is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Ali has:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total to his sister. So, the amount given to his sister is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

The remaining amount after giving half to his sister is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount of money he has after buying dinner is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, let's convert Rob's time into minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, Rob takes \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes to shingle a house.

According to the problem, Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes. So, we need to calculate double Rob's time and then add 40 minutes to it.

Double Rob's time is \(2 \times 120 = 240\) minutes.

Adding 40 minutes to this gives us \(240 + 40 = 280\) minutes.

So, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house."
"To determine the total number of skeins of wool Martha needs, we first calculate the amount required for one grandchild and then multiply by three, as she is making the same items for each of her three grandchildren.

For one grandchild:
- Hat: 2 skeins
- Scarf: 4 skeins
- Sweater: 12 skeins
- Mittens: 1 skein
- Socks: 2 skeins

Total for one grandchild: \(2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 19\) skeins

Since she is making these for three grandchildren, we multiply the total by 3:
\(19 \times 3 = 57\) skeins

Martha will need to buy 57 skeins of wool."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Chris starts with 100 math problems.
2. On Monday, he completes 12 problems. So, the remaining problems are:
   100 - 12 = 88 problems.

3. On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday. So, he completes:
   3 * 12 = 36 problems.
   The remaining problems after Tuesday are:
   88 - 36 = 52 problems.

4. On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining problems. So, he completes:
   1/4 * 52 = 13 problems.
   The remaining problems after Wednesday are:
   52 - 13 = 39 problems.

Therefore, the number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is:
39."
"First, let's determine the picking rate for each person:

- Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
- Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby picks \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
- Kathy picks twice as many as Bobby, so Kathy picks \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
- Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky picks \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, we add up the picking rates of all four individuals to find the total number of quarts they can pick per hour:

\[6 \text{ (Tony)} + 5 \text{ (Bobby)} + 10 \text{ (Kathy)} + 8 \text{ (Ricky)} = 29\]

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is 29."
"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakers had left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the total number of loaves baked.
2. Subtract the number of loaves sold in the morning.
3. Subtract the number of loaves sold in the afternoon.
4. Add the unsold loaves returned by the grocery store.

Let's do the math:

1. Total loaves baked: 200
2. Loaves sold in the morning: 93
3. Loaves sold in the afternoon: 39
4. Unsold loaves returned: 6

Now, calculate the remaining loaves:

200 (total baked) - 93 (morning sales) - 39 (afternoon sales) + 6 (returned) = 74

So, the bakers had 74 loaves of bread left."
"To determine the number of rows Jackson will plant, we need to calculate the number of rows for the red tulips and the blue tulips separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of rows for the red tulips:
- Jackson has 36 red tulips.
- He can fit 6 red tulips in a row.
- Therefore, the number of rows for the red tulips is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) rows.

Next, let's calculate the number of rows for the blue tulips:
- Jackson has 24 blue tulips.
- He can fit 8 blue tulips in a row.
- Therefore, the number of rows for the blue tulips is \( \frac{24}{8} = 3 \) rows.

Now, we add the number of rows for the red tulips and the blue tulips to find the total number of rows:
- Total number of rows = 6 (red) + 3 (blue) = 9 rows.

So, Jackson will plant a total of 9 rows of flowers."
"To determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Divide the total amount of raisins equally among the three uses (oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix):**
   \[
   \text{Raisins per use} = \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups per use}
   \]

2. **Calculate how many batches of oatmeal cookies can be made with 9 cups of raisins:**
   \[
   \text{Batches of oatmeal cookies} = \frac{9 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cup per batch}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \text{ batches}
   \]

Therefore, Heather can make \(\boxed{12}\) batches of oatmeal cookies."
"First, let's calculate Ada's current weekly electric consumption and cost.

Ada's current daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. There are 24 hours in a day, so her daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh) is:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} = 288 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

To find her weekly consumption, we multiply by 7 days:
\[ 288 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 2016 \, \text{kWh/week} \]

At a rate of $1.50 per kWh, her weekly bill is:
\[ 2016 \, \text{kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$3024 \]

Next, let's calculate her new weekly consumption after adding the device.

The new device consumes 2 kWh per hour. So, her new daily consumption is:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/hour} + 2 \, \text{kWh/hour} = 14 \, \text{kWh/hour} \]

Her new daily consumption in kWh is:
\[ 14 \, \text{kWh/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} = 336 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

Her new weekly consumption is:
\[ 336 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 2352 \, \text{kWh/week} \]

At the same rate of $1.50 per kWh, her new weekly bill is:
\[ 2352 \, \text{kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$3528 \]

Finally, the difference between her weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device is:
\[ \$3528 - \$3024 = \$504 \]

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is \$504."
"First, let's determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house (since 5 days for half a house means 10 days for a whole house).

Now, if one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, we can calculate the rate of painting per person per day. The rate is 1 house / 10 days = 0.1 houses per day.

If we have 5 people working together, their combined rate would be 5 * 0.1 houses per day = 0.5 houses per day.

To find out how many days it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we divide 1 house by their combined rate of 0.5 houses per day:

1 house / 0.5 houses per day = 2 days.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can calculate the total number of hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house:

2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"Given that Ophelia has 20 sofas, and she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can calculate the number of chairs Ophelia has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = \text{Number of sofas Ophelia has} + 2 = 20 + 2 = 22 \]

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so:

\[ \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 3 \times \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = 3 \times 22 = 66 \]

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the number of sofas Jenna has is:

\[ \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} = \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:

\[ \text{Total number of sofas} = \text{Number of sofas Ophelia has} + \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} = 20 + 64 = 84 \]
\[ \text{Total number of chairs} = \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} + \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 22 + 66 = 88 \]

Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs they have is:

\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = \text{Total number of sofas} + \text{Total number of chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought without the headphone set, we first need to determine the cost of the headphone set.

1. We know that Tom paid $48 in total for the CD and the headphone set.
2. The CD cost $4.
3. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set is $48 - $4 = $44.

Now, to find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought without the headphone set, we need to know the price of a single CD. Since the price of a single CD is given as $4, we can calculate the number of additional CDs as follows:

4. The number of additional CDs Tom could have bought is the total money he had minus the cost of the headphone set, divided by the price of a single CD.
5. This is calculated as ($48 - $44) / $4 = $4 / $4 = 1.

So, Tom would have been able to buy 1 more CD if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. For 6 weeks, Josh worked out for 4 hours each week.
2. For 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week.
3. For 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total hours:

- For the 6 weeks at 4 hours each: \(6 \times 4 = 24\) hours
- For the 2 weeks at 5 hours each: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours
- For the 1 week at 6 hours: \(1 \times 6 = 6\) hours

Adding these together gives us the total number of hours:

\(24 + 10 + 6 = 40\) hours

So, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40 hours."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
5. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

The final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is:
\[

"First, let's determine Jame's current age. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, then his current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\).

Next, we need to find out how old Jame will be in 8 years. In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\).

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, we calculate twice Jame's age in 8 years and then subtract 5:

Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \(2 \times 30 = 60\).

So, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be \(60 - 5 = 55\).

Now, we need to find out how old Jame's cousin is currently. Since this will happen in 8 years, we subtract 8 from 55 to find the cousin's current age:

Jame's cousin's current age is \(55 - 8 = 47\).

Finally, to find out how many years separate the age of the two now, we subtract Jame's current age from his cousin's current age:

The age difference is \(47 - 22 = 25\).

So, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is 25."
"Given that the computer cost $1,100 and Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can determine the cost of the printer as follows:

Cost of the printer = Cost of the computer - $400
Cost of the printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of the printer = $700

Now, let's denote the cost of one monitor as \( M \). Since Errol bought 2 monitors, the total cost for the monitors is \( 2M \).

The total cost for the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We can set up the following equation:

Cost of the computer + Cost of the 2 monitors + Cost of the printer = Total cost
$1,100 + 2M + $700 = $2,400

Now, we can solve for \( M \):

$1,100 + 2M + $700 = $2,400
$1,800 + 2M = $2,400
2M = $2,400 - $1,800
2M = $600
M = $600 / 2
M = $300

So, the cost of one monitor is $300.

The final numerical answer is:
$300"
"The boys brought back 60 seashells each. According to the problem, the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. 

So, the number of seashells each girl brought is:

"The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 mm = 62 mm thick.

To find the total thickness of the four books, we add their individual thicknesses together:

31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma should make to complete her monthly goal, we first need to calculate how many vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

Adding these up: \(18 + 21 + 15 = 54\) vlogs.

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs per month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:

\(72 - 54 = 18\)

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total bill including the tip:**
   - The base bill is $50.
   - The tip is 20% of $50, which is \(0.20 \times 50 = 10\).
   - So, the total bill including the tip is \(50 + 10 = 60\).

2. **Split the total bill evenly:**
   - Since the bill is to be split evenly between two people, each person pays half of the total bill.
   - Half of $60 is \(60 / 2 = 30\).

Therefore, you end up paying $30."
"First, let's determine how much each boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, each boy gets:

The eldest boy then added $5 to his share, making it:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

The following day, he added another $10, so his total became:

\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

He then spent $8, leaving him with:

\[ 21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

After saving some more, he tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8. So, he now has:

\[ 13 \times 3 = 39 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to break down the month of April into two halves and determine the daily savings for each half.

April has 30 days, so the first half (15 days) and the second half (15 days) are equal in length.

Let's denote the daily savings in the first half of April as \( x \). Therefore, the total savings for the first half of April would be \( 15x \).

According to the problem, Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half of April. So, the daily savings in the second half would be \( 2x \). The total savings for the second half of April would then be \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

Elvis's total savings target for the month is $1125. Therefore, the sum of the savings from both halves of the month should equal $1125:

\[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 45:

\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of April. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he needs to save:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month."
"To find out how much change Verna received, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits she bought.

1. The cost of the apples: \(3 \times \$1.50 = \$4.50\)
2. The cost of the oranges: \(5 \times \$0.80 = \$4.00\)
3. The cost of the peaches: \(6 \times \$0.75 = \$4.50\)

Now, we add up the costs of all the fruits to get the total cost:
\[
\$4.50 + \$4.00 + \$4.50 = \$13.00

"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars."

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth, as each round of calls multiplies the number of families notified by a factor of 3.

1. In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.
2. In the second round, those 3 families each call 3 more families, so \(3 \times 3 = 9\) new families are notified.
3. In the third round, the 9 families each call 3 more families, so \(9 \times 3 = 27\) new families are notified.
4. In the fourth round, the 27 families each call 3 more families, so \(27 \times 3 = 81\) new families are notified.

Therefore, during the fourth round of calls, 81 families will be notified.

- One geometry set at $10 each: \(1 \times 10 = 10.00\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00\]

Now, applying a 10% discount to the total cost:
\[30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00\]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost:
\[30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00\]

Therefore, Daniel has to spend $27.00 on all the items he wants to buy."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Carly ordered:

- Five hamburgers at $4 each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) dollars
- Ten packs of potato fries at $0.30 each: \(10 \times 0.30 = 3\) dollars
- Five cans of fruit drinks at $2 each: \(5 \times 2 = 10\) dollars

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost:

\[20 + 3 + 10 = 33\] dollars

Carly gives a fifty-dollar bill, so the change she should receive is:

\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars

Therefore, the change Carly gets back is 17 dollars."
"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned, we need to break down her sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the amount over $1000.

1. For the first $1000, she earns a 30% commission:
\[ \text{Commission for first } \$1000 = 1000 \times 0.30 = \$300 \]

2. For the sales over $1000, which in this case is $2500 - $1000 = $1500, she earns an additional 10% commission:
\[ \text{Commission for sales over } \$1000 = 1500 \times 0.10 = \$150 \]

3. Adding both commissions together gives the total amount earned:
\[ \text{Total commission} = \$300 + \$150 = \$450 \]

Therefore, Antonella earned \(\$450\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of water bottles Bill already has:

He has 2 cases of water, with each case containing 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he has is:
\[ 2 \times 24 = 48 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles Bill needs for his guests. He has 70 guests and wants to provide 2 bottles per guest. So, the total number of bottles needed for the guests is:
\[ 70 \times 2 = 140 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we need to find out how many additional bottles Bill needs to buy. We subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles needed:
\[ 140 - 48 = 92 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Bill needs to buy an additional 92 bottles of water."
"When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does in cold water. So, we calculate the time for a mile in warm water as follows:

Twice the time in cold water: \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
Adding 2 minutes: \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes for a mile in warm water.

Now, we calculate the time for 3 miles in both conditions:

For 3 miles in cold water: \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes.
For 3 miles in warm water: \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes.

The difference in time between a hot day and a cold day for 3 miles is:
\(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."
"To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings first.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day. So, his daily earnings are:
\[ 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \]

He works 4 days a week, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."
"To find the total cost for lunch today at Subway, we need to calculate the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub and then add it to the cost of the foot-long fish sub.

1. The cost of the foot-long fish sub is $40.
2. The cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is three times the cost of the foot-long fish sub, which is \(3 \times 40 = 120\) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub to get the total cost for lunch:

\[40 + 120 = 160\]

So, the total cost for lunch today at Subway is $160."
"To find the total number of holes in all the buttons, we need to calculate the holes from the buttons with two holes and the buttons with four holes separately, and then add them together.

First, we know that there are 7 buttons with 2 holes each. So, the total number of holes from these buttons is:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

Next, we need to find out how many buttons have 4 holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have 2 holes, the remaining buttons are:
\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \]

These 14 buttons each have 4 holes, so the total number of holes from these buttons is:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

Now, we add the holes from both groups of buttons to get the total number of holes:
\[ 14 + 56 = 70 \]

Therefore, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is:
\[ 70 \]"
"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to follow the given relationships step by step.

1. Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches.
2. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, so:
   \[
   \text{Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

Therefore, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches."
"First, let's determine how many cups of coffee Octavia drinks daily. Since the daily recommended amount is 4 cups and Octavia drinks half of that, she drinks:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, so he drinks:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. Therefore, the reduction needed is:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ cups} \]

Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups."
"The pet shop has a total of 45 rodents.

To break it down:
- 3 cages with 10 hamsters each: 3 cages * 10 hamsters/cage = 30 hamsters
- 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each: 3 cages * 5 guinea pigs/cage = 15 guinea pigs

Adding the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together: 30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents

Total number of rodents: 45"
"First, let's determine the weight of each person:

1. Mark weighs 150 pounds.
2. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan's weight is \(150 - 20 = 130\) pounds.
3. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob's weight is \(2 \times 130 = 260\) pounds.

Now, to find the average weight of the three friends, we add their weights together and divide by 3:

\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{\text{Mark's weight} + \text{Susan's weight} + \text{Bob's weight}}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{150 + 130 + 260}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{540}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average weight} = 180 \]

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the initial angle of the pyramid and the movement of the sun over time.

1. The initial angle of the pyramid from the ground is 32 degrees.
2. The sun moves 5 degrees per hour straight upward.
3. The sun moves for 10 hours.

The total movement of the sun in 10 hours is:
\[ 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \]

Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at 32 degrees from the ground, and moves 50 degrees upward, the final angle from the ground to the sun will be:
\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ 82 \text{ degrees} \]"
"First, let's determine the ages of James's sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, so the second son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out how many candles James needs. Since each son needs one candle per year, James needs 12 candles for the older son and 8 candles for the younger son, which totals 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Now, we need to figure out how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Each pack contains 5 candles, so we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: 20 / 5 = 4 packs.

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pack costs $3, so for 4 packs, the total cost is 4 * $3 = $12.

James spends $12 on candles."
"First, let's calculate how many minutes Judy read in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night and there are 7 nights in a week, we can calculate the total reading time for the first week as follows:

\[ 15 \, \text{minutes/night} \times 7 \, \text{nights} = 105 \, \text{minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pages she read in the first week. Given that she reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she reads per minute and then multiply by the total minutes read in the first week:

\[ \frac{2 \, \text{pages}}{1.5 \, \text{minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \, \text{pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total pages read in the first week:

\[ 105 \, \text{minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \, \text{pages/minute} = 140 \, \text{pages} \]

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages. To find the total number of pages read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week:

\[ 140 \, \text{pages} + 100 \, \text{pages} = 240 \, \text{pages} \]

Therefore, Judy read a total of 240 pages in two weeks."
"Cody ate a third of the 12 sandwiches, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) sandwiches.

Trevor ate a quarter of the 12 sandwiches, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \) sandwiches.

Together, they ate \( 4 + 3 = 7 \) sandwiches.

Therefore, the number of sandwiches left is \( 12 - 7 = 5 \).

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so \( S = 44 \).
2. In 7 years, Shiloh will be \( S + 7 \) years old.
3. In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, in 7 years, his nephew will be \( N + 7 \) years old.

We can set up the equation based on the information given:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substituting \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Now, we solve for \( N \):
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

Final answer:
10"
"Let's break down the payments step by step:

1. For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 per tooth. So, for three teeth, that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. So, for two teeth, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all the amounts:

$5.00 (first tooth) + $3.00 (next three teeth) + $1.00 (last two teeth) = $9.00

The tooth fairy left Sharon a total of $9.00."
"Given that Richie scored 80 goals, and he scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can determine the number of goals Mark scored as follows:

\[ \text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Next, since Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, we can determine the number of goals Anna scored as follows:

\[ \text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:

\[ \text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} \]
\[ \text{Total goals} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

Therefore, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is 175."
"To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we first need to calculate how much money each of them made.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each, so the total amount he made is:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Liam made $63.

Now, to find out how much more money Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:
\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Mitchell made 21 more dollars than Liam that weekend."
"First, let's calculate how much Peter spends each day. Since he has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days), he will spend:

\[ \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day} \]

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spends his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. So, for 4 days, he spends:

\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each wooden action figure costs $5, the number of wooden action figures he buys is:

\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ wooden action figures} \]

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. He has $30 left after buying the wooden action figures (since he spent $40 out of his $70):

\[ 70 - 40 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

The number of plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining $30 is:

\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ plastic action figures} \]

So, the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is:

\[ 8 + 15 = 23 \]

Therefore, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is 23."
"To find out how much the kitten has cost Leah so far, we need to add up the costs of the spaying, the vaccines, and the broken vases.

1. Spaying cost: $200
2. Cost of 3 vaccines: $20 each, so 3 * $20 = $60
3. Cost of 4 broken vases: $12 each, so 4 * $12 = $48

Now, we add these amounts together:

$200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (vases) = $308

The final numerical answer is:

1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per week.
2. Determine the number of weeks in a month (assuming an average month has about 4 weeks).
3. Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.
4. Compare the total number of roses Ford grows in a month with the total number of roses he needs to supply to the flower shops in a month to find the deficit.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per week.
- First flower shop: 20 roses
- Second flower shop: 15 roses
- Third flower shop: 30 roses

Total roses supplied per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Step 2: Determine the number of weeks in a month.
- We assume an average month has 4 weeks.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.
- Ford grows 40 roses every week.
- In a month (4 weeks), Ford grows: 40 roses/week * 4 weeks = 160 roses

Step 4: Calculate the total number of roses Ford needs to supply to the flower shops in a month.
- Ford supplies 65 roses per week.
- In a month (4 weeks), Ford needs to supply: 65 roses/week * 4 weeks = 260 roses

Step 5: Determine the deficit.
- Ford grows 160 roses in a month.
- Ford needs to supply 260 roses in a month.
- The deficit is: 260 roses - 160 roses = 100 roses

Therefore, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees.

First, let's calculate the percentage error in the temperature setting:

\[ \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Temperature} - \text{Set Temperature}}{\text{Set Temperature}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Error} = 0.04 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Error} = 4\% \]

Now, we know the oven is 4% too hot. To find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to set the oven to a temperature that is 4% lower than 520 degrees.

Let \( T \) be the temperature Maggie should set her oven to. The relationship can be expressed as:

\[ T = 520 \times (1 - 0.04) \]
\[ T = 520 \times 0.96 \]
\[ T = 499.2 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 499.2 degrees."
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, the first movie is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours into minutes gives:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]
Adding the 5 minutes gives:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 125 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the durations of the two movies together:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 125 \text{ minutes} = 215 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate how much 30% of Herb's house price is, and then subtract that from Herb's house price.

1. Calculate 30% of $76,000:
\[ 30\% \times 76,000 = 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

2. Subtract that amount from Herb's house price to find the value of Juan's house:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

So, Juan's house is worth $53,200.

3. Now, add the value of both houses to find the combined value:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy brought. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend:

- Judy's total: \(12 \text{ cups} + 24 \text{ dishes} = 36 \text{ utensils}\)
- Her friend's total: \(40 \text{ cups} + 44 \text{ dishes} = 84 \text{ utensils}\)

Adding these together, the total number of utensils brought by the two is \(36 + 84 = 120\).

"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount. 

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

Since the question asks for the cost per pair of contacts, and assuming a pair is two contacts, the cost per pair is:
\[ 1.00 \times 2 = 2.00 \]

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \boxed{2.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours worked by Jill and John.

Jill worked:
- 2 hours on Saturday
- 1 hour on Sunday
Total hours for Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

John worked:
- Twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday
- Three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday
Total hours for John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours

Now, let's calculate the earnings for each.

Jill's earnings:
- $10 per hour * 3 hours = $30

John's earnings:
- $10 per hour * 7 hours = $70

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:
- John's earnings - Jill's earnings = $70 - $30 = $40

John earned $40 more than Jill.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
$40"
"First, let's calculate the total calories Hannah burns from aerobics and running.

- Aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
- Running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Now, according to the given ratio, Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. So, we can calculate the total amount of water she needs to drink as follows:

Total water needed = (Total calories burned / 200 calories) * 100 ml
Total water needed = (1600 calories / 200 calories) * 100 ml
Total water needed = 8 * 100 ml
Total water needed = 800 ml

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the note on the jar, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans.

So, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) can be expressed as:
\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]

And the number of green jelly beans \( G \) can be expressed as:
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]
\[ 3B = 4500 \]
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."
"To find the average of the three measurements, we first need to determine the typing speeds at each of the three points in time.

1. Initial typing speed: 47 WPM
2. After lessons: 52 WPM
3. After further increase: 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Now, we add these three speeds together and divide by 3 to find the average.

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{156}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average} = 52 \]

The average of the three measurements is 52 WPM."
"To find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and donuts for breakfast, we need to calculate the weight change for each option over 5 weeks and then find the difference between these changes.

1. **Cheerios:**
   - Weight loss per week: 1.25 pounds
   - Over 5 weeks: \(1.25 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 6.25 \, \text{pounds}\)

2. **Donuts:**
   - Weight gain per week: 1.75 pounds
   - Over 5 weeks: \(1.75 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 8.75 \, \text{pounds}\)

3. **Difference in weight change:**
   - Weight change with donuts: +8.75 pounds
   - Weight change with Cheerios: -6.25 pounds
   - Difference: \(8.75 \, \text{pounds} - (-6.25 \, \text{pounds}) = 8.75 \, \text{pounds} + 6.25 \, \text{pounds} = 15 \, \text{pounds}\)

The difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating donuts and Cheerios for breakfast is 15 pounds."
"To determine the total number of seats Alex will need, we need to account for all the people who will be attending the event.

1. Alex initially invites 100 people via email.
2. Each of these 100 people will also invite 2 friends. So, the number of additional people invited by email invites is \(100 \times 2 = 200\).
3. Alex also calls 10 of her friends and invites them. So, there are 10 more people invited this way.
4. Out of these 10 friends, 8 will bring their spouses. So, there are 8 additional people (spouses) coming.

Now, let's sum up all the attendees:
- Initial email invites: 100
- Additional people from email invites: 200
- Friends invited by phone: 10
- Spouses: 8

Total number of seats needed = \(100 + 200 + 10 + 8 = 318\).

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats."
"The Affenpinscher weighed 10 pounds.

The Dachshund weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so:
\[ \text{Dachshund's weight} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ pounds} \]

The Papillon weighed one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so:
\[ \text{Papillon's weight} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

The Mastiff weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so:
\[ \text{Mastiff's weight} = 44 \times 5 = 220 \text{ pounds} \]

The Mastiff weighed 220 pounds."
"To determine how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we need to calculate the total cost for each platform and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the boots on Amazon:
- Cost of boots: $16
- Shipping cost: $4
- Total cost on Amazon: $16 + $4 = $20

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the boots on eBay:
- Cost of boots: $13
- Shipping cost: Twice the cost of Amazon's shipping, so $4 * 2 = $8
- Total cost on eBay: $13 + $8 = $21

Now, we find the difference in total cost between eBay and Amazon:
- Total cost on eBay: $21
- Total cost on Amazon: $20
- Difference: $21 - $20 = $1

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to grow taller than 20 feet, given that it doubles its height every day and starts at 4 feet tall.

Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk day by day:

- Day 0: 4 feet
- Day 1: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
- Day 2: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
- Day 3: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

On Day 3, the beanstalk reaches 32 feet, which is taller than the 20 feet required to be taller than Mark's window.

Therefore, it takes 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the weekly protein intake based on daily consumption.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, 200 grams (which is double the amount) would contain double the protein:

\[ 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} \times \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

So, John gets 6 grams of protein from 200 grams of mushrooms each day.

Next, to find out how much protein he gets in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ 6 \text{ grams of protein/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein/week} \]

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms daily."
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

1. The base price for 2 implants is $2000 each, so for 2 implants, it's:
   \[2 \times 2000 = 4000\]

2. For one of the implants, there's an extra cost for a porcelain crown, which is $500. So, the total cost for the dental work is:
   \[4000 + 500 = 4500\]

3. George has already put down a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
   \[4500 - 600 = 3900\]

4. George makes $15 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
   \[3900 \div 15 = 260\]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Colby has in each type of coin:

- Quarters: 8 quarters × $0.25 = $2.00
- Dimes: 6 dimes × $0.10 = $0.60
- Nickels: 14 nickels × $0.05 = $0.70
- Pennies: 15 pennies × $0.01 = $0.15

Now, let's add up all the money Colby has:

$2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45

Since each gumball costs a nickel ($0.05), we can find out how many gumballs Colby can buy by dividing the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:

$3.45 ÷ $0.05 = 69

Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"To find the total number of legs the pets in the store have, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

- Dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- Cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- Birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:

\(20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}\)

Therefore, the total number of legs the pets in the store have is 48."
"Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He increases the weight by 50%, so the new weight is:

\[ 8 \text{ pounds} \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, the weight turns out to be too heavy, so he uses a weight that is 2 pounds lighter than 12 pounds:

\[ 12 \text{ pounds} - 2 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

The weight that he now uses is 10 pounds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Games**: Steve gets 5 games for his birthday.
2. **First Year**: He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so he gets 12 more games.
3. **Second Year**: He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so he gets 24 more games.
4. **Third Year**: He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, so he gets 48 more games.
5. **Christmas Gifts**: He gets 5 games every year for 3 years, so he gets 15 more games.

Now, let's add all these up:

- Initial games: 5
- First year: 12
- Second year: 24
- Third year: 48
- Christmas gifts: 15

Total games = 5 + 12 + 24 + 48 + 15 = 104

So, after 3 years, Steve has 104 games."
"First, we need to determine the speed of the plane. The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so the speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. Using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

we substitute the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate.

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolate Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds of chocolate Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds as Ruiz in an hour:

\[ 60 \times \frac{3}{4} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of chocolate each of them can make in 12 hours. For Ruiz:

\[ 60 \times 12 = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

For Marissa:

\[ 45 \times 12 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the amounts together to find the total amount of chocolate they made together:

\[ 720 + 540 = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of chocolate they made together is:

\[ 1260 \text{ pounds} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Monday's Spending:**
   - Howard spends $8 at the arcade.

2. **Tuesday's Spending:**
   - He spends twice as much as he did on Monday.
   - Therefore, he spends \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars on Tuesday.

3. **Wednesday's Spending:**
   - He spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday.
   - Therefore, he spends \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars on Wednesday.

4. **Total Spending:**
   - Adding up all the spending: \(8 + 16 + 64 = 88\) dollars.

5. **Initial Amount:**
   - Howard originally had $100.

6. **Money Left:**
   - Subtracting the total spending from the initial amount: \(100 - 88 = 12\) dollars.

Therefore, Howard has $12 left."
"To calculate the total money Patrick earned, we need to break down the earnings into two parts: the first four hours and the next two hours.

For the first four hours:
- He sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Therefore, in one hour, he earned \(15 \times 0.50 = 7.50\) dollars.
- Over four hours, he earned \(4 \times 7.50 = 30\) dollars.

For the next two hours:
- He sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Therefore, in one hour, he earned \(10 \times 0.60 = 6.00\) dollars.
- Over two hours, he earned \(2 \times 6.00 = 12\) dollars.

Adding the earnings from both periods:
- Total earnings = \(30 + 12 = 42\) dollars.

Therefore, Patrick earned a total of 42 dollars from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations per tire for Jeremy's monthly driving.
2. Determine the total number of rotations per tire over a year.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations per tire for Jeremy's monthly driving.**

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
\[ \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/rotation cycle}} \times 725 \text{ rotations/cycle} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of rotations per tire over a year.**

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of rotations per tire in a year is:
\[ 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.**

To find out how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations, we divide the total number of rotations by the number of rotations per year:
\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the tire will need to be replaced in \(\boxed{6}\) years."
"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of washings per pump.
2. Determine the cost per washing.
3. Calculate the cost per pump.

First, we know that 2 pumps of shampoo give 120 washings. Therefore, 1 pump would give half of that number of washings:
\[ \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per washing. The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, and it provides 120 washings:
\[ \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{24.00}{120} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \]

Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost per pump is:
\[ \text{Cost per pump} = 60 \times 0.20 = 12.00 \text{ dollars} \]

To convert this cost into cents, we multiply by 100 (since 1 dollar = 100 cents):
\[ \text{Cost per pump in cents} = 12.00 \times 100 = 1200 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost per pump is:
\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"First, let's calculate the discount on the items Joe wants to buy.

The shirt originally costs $25, and there is a 30% discount on it. The discount amount for the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

So, the discounted price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

Next, the shorts cost $35, and there is no discount mentioned for the shorts. So, the price of the shorts remains $35.

Now, let's add the discounted price of the shirt and the price of the shorts to find the total cost of the items:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. Since the total cost of the items is $52.50, Joe does not have enough money to buy both items. However, if we assume the question is asking hypothetically or there's a mistake in the given values, we can still calculate how much more money Joe would need or how much he would be short.

The amount Joe would be short by is:
\[ 52.50 - 50 = 2.50 \]

But since the question asks for the money left, and Joe cannot make the purchase with the given amount, the answer would be that he has $0 left and is short by $2.50. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the amount of butter needed for the total number of dozens of croissants.

First, Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days. So, the total number of dozens of croissants he will make in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we know that it takes \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, for 28 dozen croissants, the amount of butter needed is:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make these croissants."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we first need to calculate the cost of repaving each street.

1. Calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:

   - Cost for Monica's street = $194 * 150 = $29,100

2. Calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:
   - Cost per meter = $194
   - Length of Lewis' street = 490 meters
   - Cost for Lewis' street = $194 * 490 = $95,060

3. Find the difference in cost between Lewis' street and Monica's street:
   - Difference in cost = Cost for Lewis' street - Cost for Monica's street
   - Difference in cost = $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining 5 months.

1. **Cost for the first 5 months:**
   - Initial funding: $100,000

2. **Cost for the remaining 5 months:**
   - The research took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so the remaining period is \(10 - 5 = 5\) months.
   - Each of these months cost 50% more than the previous month's cost.
   - The cost for the 6th month is \(100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000\).
   - The cost for the 7th month is \(150,000 \times 1.5 = 225,000\).
   - The cost for the 8th month is \(225,000 \times 1.5 = 337,500\).
   - The cost for the 9th month is \(337,500 \times 1.5 = 506,250\).
   - The cost for the 10th month is \(506,250 \times 1.5 = 759,375\).

Now, we sum up the costs for the remaining 5 months:
\[150,000 + 225,000 + 337,500 + 506,250 + 759,375 = 1,978,125\]

Finally, we add the cost of the first 5 months to the cost of the remaining 5 months:
\[100,000 + 1,978,125 = 2,078,125\]

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is:

"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to add up the ounces of meat each player ate.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound equals 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these together:

6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 20 + 16 = 36 ounces.

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 36 ounces."
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to consider the number of days in March and the average number of posts per member per day.

March typically has 31 days.

Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day.

So, the total number of posts per member in March is:
3 posts/day * 31 days = 93 posts/member

Since there are 1000 members in the group, the total number of posts for the group in March is:
93 posts/member * 1000 members = 93,000 posts

Therefore, the total number of posts that the group will have in March is:

"After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

In the second week, it doubled in height, so it became 3 inches * 2 = 6 inches tall.

In the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so it became 6 inches + 4 inches = 10 inches tall.

Therefore, after 3 weeks, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall."
"To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of meat from the bull.
2. Determine how much meat Prince sells in one day.
3. Calculate the number of days required to sell all the meat.

Step 1: The total amount of meat from the bull is 750kg.

Step 2: Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day. Therefore, the amount of meat he sells in one day is:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Step 3: To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell 750kg of meat, we divide the total amount of meat by the amount he sells per day:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"First, let's calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, so the total number of seats is:

\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \]

Next, we need to find out how many seats were occupied by the administrators. Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \]

This means 18 seats were occupied by the administrators. Now, we need to find out how many seats were left after the administrators took their seats:

\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \]

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. So, the number of seats occupied by the parents is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

Now, we need to find out how many seats were left for the students. The remaining seats after the administrators and parents took their seats are:

\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"

"To find out how many total times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to calculate the remaining play times for each DVD and then sum them up.

For the first DVD:
- Total play times before breaking: 1000
- Times already played: 356
- Remaining play times: 1000 - 356 = 644

For the second DVD:
- Total play times before breaking: 1000
- Times already played: 135
- Remaining play times: 1000 - 135 = 865

Now, we add the remaining play times of both DVDs:
- Total remaining play times: 644 + 865 = 1509

Therefore, both DVDs can be played a total of 1509 times before they break."
"To calculate the total cost of John's physical therapy, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of hours John spent in physical therapy.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the hourly rate.

First, let's find the total number of hours John spent in physical therapy:

- John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks.
- Each week, he went twice, so he had 2 sessions per week.
- Each session lasted 2 hours.

So, the total number of hours per week is:
\[ 2 \text{ sessions/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/session} = 4 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, we multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost:
- The cost per hour is $125.
- Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 24 \text{ hours} \times 125 \text{ dollars/hour} = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of John's physical therapy is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Pack of Gum**: Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.

2. **Gum Chewing at School**: He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, after school, he has:
   \[
   20 - 4 = 16 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Gum Chewing on the Way Home and After Dinner**: He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so he chews:
   \[
   1 + 1 = 2 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   After these, he has:
   \[
   16 - 2 = 14 \text{ pieces}
   \]

4. **Giving Half to His Sister**: He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives:
   \[
   \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   After giving half to his sister, he has:
   \[
   14 - 7 = 7 \text{ pieces}
   \]

So, at the end of the day, Jim has \(\boxed{7}\) pieces of gum left."
"Charmaine will be 16 years old in 12 years. To find out how old she is now, we subtract 12 years from 16 years:

16 - 12 = 4

Now, to find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we subtract the total cost for the baseballs from the total cost for the basketballs:
- Difference in cost: $112 - $27 = $85

The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To find out how many flowers have bloomed, we first need to calculate the total number of flowers planted in Arianna's garden. 

Arianna's garden has 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row. So, the total number of flowers is:

\[ 10 \text{ rows} \times 20 \text{ flowers/row} = 200 \text{ flowers} \]

Now, we know that only \( \frac{4}{5} \) of the planted flowers have bloomed. To find the number of bloomed flowers, we multiply the total number of flowers by \( \frac{4}{5} \):

\[ 200 \times \frac{4}{5} = 160 \]

So, the number of flowers that have bloomed in Arianna's garden is:

160"
"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb/s to Mb/s.
2. Convert the speed from Mb/s to Mb/h.

Step 1: Convert kb/s to Mb/s
Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we divide the speed in kb/s by 1000 to get the speed in Mb/s.
\[ \text{Speed in Mb/s} = \frac{20 \text{ kb/s}}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \]

Step 2: Convert Mb/s to Mb/h
There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply the speed in Mb/s by 3600 to get the speed in Mb/h.
\[ \text{Speed in Mb/h} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s/h} = 72 \text{ Mb/h} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"To calculate the total number of cars towed in that week, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. So, for three days, the total is \(10 \times 3 = 30\) cars.
2. For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars than the first three days, which means it pulled \(10 - 4 = 6\) cars each day. So, for four days, the total is \(6 \times 4 = 24\) cars.

Adding the totals from both parts of the week, we get:
\[30 + 24 = 54\]

Therefore, the total number of cars towed that week is 54."
"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.

First, let's convert Adam's current height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot:

\[ \text{Adam's current height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how much taller Adam needs to be to meet the 4 feet requirement:

\[ \text{Height difference} = 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:

\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, we can calculate the number of years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference:

\[ \text{Years required} = \frac{\frac{2}{3} \text{ feet}}{\frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year}} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.
2. Calculate the total cost to acquire the cars.
3. Determine the profit.
4. Calculate James's commission on the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.**

James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost to acquire the cars.**

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
\[ \text{Cost per car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000 \]

**Step 3: Determine the profit.**

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

**Step 4: Calculate James's commission on the profit.**

James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
\[ \text{Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

**Final Answer:**
\[ \boxed{17500} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many of the 100 riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate:

\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \]

So, 25 riders can stay upright.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are men. We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, which means 40% are men. Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is:

\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can calculate the price of a gold jewel as follows:

Price of a gold jewel = \(\frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600\)

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel, so:

Price of a silver jewel = \(1600 - 400 = 1200\)

Now, to find the total price for all three jewels, we add the prices together:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = \(2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800\)

The total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and then sum them up.

1. **Snowflake Stamps**: Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. **Truck Stamps**: Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. So, the number of truck stamps is \(16 + 3 = 19\).
3. **Rose Stamps**: Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. So, the number of rose stamps is \(19 - 9 = 10\).

Now, we add up all the stamps:
\[ 16 \text{ (snowflake)} + 19 \text{ (truck)} + 10 \text{ (rose)} = 45 \]

Therefore, Max bought a total of 45 stamps."
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob. 

Bob is driving at 55 mph, and Tom is driving at 70 mph. The difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, we can find the time it takes for Tom to catch up by dividing the distance by the relative speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"Naomi caught 17 fish.

Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, so Darren caught \(17 - 6 = 11\) fish.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we first need to calculate the cost per class if he misses a certain number of classes.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as \( x \). If he misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The total cost of the classes is $60, so the cost per class is given by the total cost divided by the number of classes attended, which is \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \).

We need this cost per class to be no more than $10. Therefore, we set up the inequality:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first multiply both sides of the inequality by \( 10 - x \) (noting that \( 10 - x > 0 \) or \( x < 10 \)):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]

Next, we distribute the 10 on the right side:
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

Then, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 100 from both sides:
\[ 60 - 100 \leq -10x \]
\[ -40 \leq -10x \]

Finally, we divide both sides by -10, remembering to reverse the inequality sign:
\[ 4 \geq x \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

This means Manny can miss up to 4 classes. If he misses 5 or more classes, the cost per class will exceed $10. Therefore, the number of classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10 is 4.

\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many customers Julie processes daily. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, and Jewel processes 50 customers daily, Julie processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers daily.

Next, we calculate the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in a single day. This is \(50 + 100 = 150\) customers.

Since they work all days of the week, we multiply the daily total by 7 to find the weekly total. Therefore, the total weekly production for the two is \(150 \times 7 = 1050\) customers.

Final numerical answer:

"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

1. **Cost of one apple:**
   - Four apples cost $5.20.
   - Therefore, the cost of one apple is \( \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of one orange:**
   - Three oranges cost $3.30.
   - Therefore, the cost of one orange is \( \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost for 5 apples:**
   - Since one apple costs $1.30, 5 apples will cost \( 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \) dollars.

4. **Total cost for 5 oranges:**
   - Since one orange costs $1.10, 5 oranges will cost \( 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \) dollars.

5. **Total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:**
   - Adding the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we get \( 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \) dollars.

Therefore, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) it will take him to dig the hole is:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price of the truck to the cost of each of the additional features.

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so \( \frac{1}{3} \times 7500 = 2500 \) dollars
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so \( 2500 - 500 = 2000 \) dollars
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1500

Now, we add all these costs together:

\[ 30000 + 7500 + 2500 + 2000 + 1500 = 43500 \]

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"First, let's calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise:

\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$20000 + (0.05 \times \$20000) = \$20000 + \$1000 = \$21000 \]

Next, we add the bonus, which is half a month's salary:

\[ \text{Bonus} = \frac{1}{2} \times \$21000 = \$10500 \]

So, Tim's total monthly income after the raise and bonus is:

\[ \text{Total Monthly Income} = \$21000 + \$10500 = \$31500 \]

To find out how much Tim will make in a year, we multiply his total monthly income by 12:

\[ \text{Annual Income} = \$31500 \times 12 = \$378000 \]

Therefore, Tim will make \(\$378000\) in a year."
"To find the total cost of everything James bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of suits:**
   - James buys 10 suits.
   - Each suit costs $750.
   - Total cost for suits = 10 suits * $750/suit = $7500.

2. **Cost of dress pants:**
   - James buys 10 dress pants.
   - Each dress pant costs 1/5 the cost of a suit.
   - Cost of one dress pant = $750 / 5 = $150.

"To calculate the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to determine the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add these times together.

First, let's calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He has to dig 24 feet of soil.
- Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.

Next, let's calculate the time to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs half as fast through clay, which is 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour.
- He has to dig 8 feet of clay.
- Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

"First, let's calculate the total cost Clara paid for her pomegranates on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the voucher was:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \]

She got a $2 discount, so the final amount she paid was:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost Sheila paid for her pomegranates on Wednesday.

The price per pomegranate on Wednesday was $30, so the total cost before the discount for 20 pomegranates was:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \]

Sheila got a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount was:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the final amount she paid was:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \]

Now, we find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the earnings from green hats in the first month:**
   - Ariadne's sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
   - The sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from green hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month were \( 400 \times 2 = 800 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total earnings for the first month:**
   - Total earnings in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total earnings in the first month = \( 400 + 800 = 1200 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the earnings for the second month:**
   - The sales in the second month were \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total sales of the first month.
   - Therefore, the sales in the second month = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total earnings for the two months:**
   - Total earnings for two months = Earnings in the first month + Earnings in the second month
   - Total earnings for two months = \( 1200 + 900 = 2100 \) dollars.

Final numerical answer:
2100"
"James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he is charged for 3 hours.

The first paid hour costs $15. Each hour after that is twice the cost, so the second hour costs $15 * 2 = $30, and the third hour costs $30 * 2 = $60.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of each hour:
$15 (first hour) + $30 (second hour) + $60 (third hour) = $105.

James paid $105."
"Sally's bank account increased from $200 to $420 this week. The difference in her bank account balance is:

$420 - $200 = $220

If her weekly wage should be $300, and she only has $220 in her account, the amount withheld from her wage is:

$300 - $220 = $80

Therefore, $80 were withheld from Sally’s wage."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed.
2. Determine the number of whole eggs required.
3. Convert the number of whole eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed.
- Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves.
- Lori is inviting 16 guests.
- Total deviled egg halves = 3 halves/guest * 16 guests = 48 halves.

Step 2: Determine the number of whole eggs required.
- 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves.
- Number of whole eggs needed = 48 halves / 2 halves/egg = 24 eggs.

Step 3: Convert the number of whole eggs into dozens.
- 1 dozen = 12 eggs.
- Number of dozens needed = 24 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 2 dozens.

Final numerical answer:
2 dozens"
"Shiela has already written 1/3 of the 15-page research paper. To find out how many pages she has written, we calculate:

Therefore, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline (30 days - 20 days = 10 days)."
"To calculate the total cost for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses for the hanger and fuel.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane**: $150,000
2. **Monthly Hanger Rental**: $5000
3. **Monthly Fuel Cost**: $5000 * 2 = $10,000

Now, let's calculate the total monthly cost for the hanger and fuel:
\[ \text{Total Monthly Cost} = \$5000 + \$10,000 = \$15,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the first year (12 months):
\[ \text{Total Annual Cost for Hanger and Fuel} = \$15,000 \times 12 = \$180,000 \]

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the total annual cost for the hanger and fuel:
\[ \text{Total Cost for the First Year} = \$150,000 + \$180,000 = \$330,000 \]

So, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is:
\[ \$330,000 \]"
"Given that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, we can use this information to find out the cooking times for the other ingredients.

1. **Cooking time for rice (R):** 30 minutes
2. **Cooking time for pork (P):** It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. So, \( P = R + 20 \) minutes. Substituting the value of R, we get \( P = 30 + 20 = 50 \) minutes.
3. **Cooking time for beans (B):** Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. So, \( B = \frac{1}{2} (P + R) \). Substituting the values of P and R, we get \( B = \frac{1}{2} (50 + 30) = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \) minutes.

Now, to find the total cooking time for all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans:

\[ \text{Total cooking time} = R + P + B = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

**Final answer:** 120 minutes"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):

- Cost of 1/2 pound almonds: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars
- Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars
- Total cost of the first mixture: \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):

- Cost of 1/5 pound almonds: \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars
- Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars
- Total cost of the second mixture: \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:

- Difference in cost: \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars

Therefore, the first mixture costs $3 more than the second mixture."
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:
1. The total number of heads is 20, so:
\[ S + G = 20 \]

2. The total number of legs is 70, so:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To solve for \( S \) and \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

Total newspapers delivered in a day = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers - (Newspapers to District A + Newspapers to District C)

Let's calculate:

Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - (198 + 209)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 407
Newspapers delivered to District B = 193

James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."
"To determine how many recipes John learns, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours John spends in the class.
2. Determine how many recipes he learns based on the total hours of class time.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours John spends in the class:

- The class meets 4 times a week.
- Each session is 2 hours long.
- The class runs for 6 weeks.

So, the total number of hours is:
\[ 4 \text{ sessions/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/session} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how many recipes he learns. He learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. Therefore, we divide the total hours by 1.5:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ hours}}{1.5 \text{ hours/recipe}} = 32 \text{ recipes} \]

So, John learns 32 recipes."
"First, let's determine the number of history teachers on the basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

So, there are 90 history teachers. Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

This means there are 60 math teachers. Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, so the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours."
"First, let's determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's amount as follows:

\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, we know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's amount as follows:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, we add together the amounts of money that Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia have:

\[ \text{Total money} = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360 \]

If they decide to share the money equally, each person would get:

\[ \text{Each person's share} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \]

So, if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them, each would have \(\boxed{120}\) dollars."

"Christina had a total of 30 days of mood records. Out of these, 12 were good, 8 were bad, and the rest were neutral. 

First, let's calculate the number of neutral days:
- Total days = 30
- Good days = 12
- Bad days = 8
- Neutral days = Total days - Good days - Bad days
- Neutral days = 30 - 12 - 8 = 10

Now, let's account for the next three days:
- The next three days are good, neutral, and good.
- This adds 2 more good days to her record.

So, the total number of good days now is:
- Original good days = 12
- Additional good days = 2
- Total good days = 12 + 2 = 14

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 14."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are 8 more dogs, so now there are 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
3. James buys toys for these 12 dogs, so he now has 12 toys.
4. When he returns, there are twice as many dogs as before, so there are 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.
5. To accommodate these 24 dogs, James needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys.
6. After buying these toys, there are 12 + 12 = 24 toys in total.
7. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs toys for those 3 dogs.
8. Therefore, he no longer needs 3 toys.

So, the total number of toys James needs is 24 - 3 = 21.

"To find out by how much the group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we first need to calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults.

The weight of one adult is 80 kg. Therefore, the total weight of 8 adults is:
\[ 80 \, \text{kg/adult} \times 8 \, \text{adults} = 640 \, \text{kg} \]

Adding Jack's weight to this total:
\[ 640 \, \text{kg} + 80 \, \text{kg} = 720 \, \text{kg} \]

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much the group will exceed this limit, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 \, \text{kg} - 700 \, \text{kg} = 20 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, the group will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"Given that Katarina has 68 cookies, we can work backwards to find out how many cookies Max and the Cookie Monster have.

1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has \(68 + 5 = 73\) cookies.
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has \(73 - 12 = 61\) cookies.
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has \(73 + 23 = 96\) cookies.

Now, to find the total number of cookies they have, we add up the cookies each one has:

They have a total of 298 cookies."
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the extension is \( 0.5x \) cm. Additionally, she adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom. Therefore, the total length of the dress after these modifications is:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 \]

We know that the final length of the dress is 140 cm. So, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, we divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]

\[ x = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as \( x \). Therefore, the age of the older triplet would be \( x + 7 \) since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet.

Since there is one set of twins, the age of each twin is the same. Let's denote the age of each twin as \( y \).

The combined ages of the four individuals (one twin, one triplet, and the other two triplets) are given as 44. So, we can write the equation as:

\[ y + (x + 7) + x + x = 44 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ y + 3x + 7 = 44 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ y + 3x = 37 \]

Since the twins are the same age, and the triplets are \( x \) and \( x + 7 \), we need to find the value of \( y \). We can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):

\[ y = 37 - 3x \]

Now, we need to find integer values for \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy this equation. Since \( x \) is the age of the younger triplet, it must be a positive integer, and \( y \) must also be a positive integer.

Let's test some values for \( x \):

If \( x = 8 \):

\[ y = 37 - 3(8) = 37 - 24 = 13 \]

So, the ages are:
- One triplet: 8 years old
- The other triplet: 15 years old
- The twin: 13 years old

Let's check the combined ages:

\[ 13 + 15 + 8 + 8 = 44 \]

This satisfies the condition. Therefore, the age of one of the twins is 13.

\[ \text{Cost of 10 candies} = \frac{10}{4} \times 3.20 = 2.50 \times 3.20 = 8.00 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 lollipops. Each lollipop costs $0.40, so:

\[ \text{Cost of 10 lollipops} = 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the 10 lollipops and the 10 candies to find the total cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8.00 + 4.00 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $12.00."
"First, let's calculate how many coins Neil saves each month. Since Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong, we can calculate Neil's monthly savings as follows:

Rong saves 20 coins per month. Neil saves \( 20 + \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \) coins per month.

Calculating \( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \):
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

So, Neil saves \( 20 + 8 = 28 \) coins per month.

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each has saved over ten years. Since there are 12 months in a year, over ten years, there are \( 10 \times 12 = 120 \) months.

Rong's total savings over ten years:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings over ten years:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding Rong's and Neil's total savings together:
\[ 2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

Therefore, the total number of coins they have after ten years is 5760."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and the dog needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:

\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Let the total bill be \( T \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:

\[ 0.60 \times T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:

\[ T = 40 + 0.60 \times T \]

To find \( T \), we can rearrange the equation:

\[ T - 0.60 \times T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40 \times T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. Therefore, the amount he leaves with is:

\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

John leaves with $25."
"To find the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - Therefore, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = \$1.0\).
   - There are 5 bananas in a crate.
   - The total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = \$5.0\).

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in a crate.
   - The total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = \$6.0\).

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - Oranges cost three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1.0.
   - Therefore, one orange costs \(3 \times 1.0 = \$3.0\).
   - There are 7 oranges in a crate.
   - The total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = \$21.0\).

4. **Total Cost of the Crate:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges.
   - Total cost = Cost of bananas + Cost of apples + Cost of oranges
   - Total cost = \$5.0 + \$6.0 + \$21.0 = \$32.0

The price for such a crate of fruit is \(\$32.0\)."
"To find the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter, we need to determine the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares**: We are given that there are 14 red squares.
2. **Blue Squares**: There are 4 more blue squares than red squares. So, the number of blue squares is \(14 + 4 = 18\).
3. **Green Squares**: There are 6 more green squares than blue squares. So, the number of green squares is \(18 + 6 = 24\).
4. **White Squares**: There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. So, the number of white squares is \(24 - 12 = 12\).

Now, we sum up all the squares:
\[ 14 \text{ (red)} + 18 \text{ (blue)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 12 \text{ (white)} = 68 \]

Therefore, the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter is 68."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of high chairs needed:**
   - The problem states that there are 8 high chairs.

2. **Calculate the number of regular chairs needed:**
   - The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs.
   - Therefore, the number of regular chairs = 5 * 8 = 40.

3. **Calculate the total number of chairs needed:**
   - The total number of chairs needed = number of high chairs + number of regular chairs.
   - Total chairs needed = 8 + 40 = 48.

4. **Determine the total number of people attending:**
   - There are 42 adults and 15 babies.
   - Total people = 42 + 15 = 57.

5. **Calculate the number of additional chairs needed:**

   - Since the total chairs available are 48, the additional chairs needed = 57 - 48 = 9.

Therefore, Mia has to get 9 more chairs."
"To find the number of 8 point bucks, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bucks in the field.
2. Calculate the number of 8 point bucks from the total number of bucks.

Step 1: Calculate the number of bucks.
50 percent of the 50 deer are bucks. So, we calculate 50% of 50:
\[ 50 \times 0.50 = 25 \]
So, there are 25 bucks in the field.

Step 2: Calculate the number of 8 point bucks.
20 percent of the bucks are 8 points. So, we calculate 20% of 25:
\[ 25 \times 0.20 = 5 \]
So, there are 5 8 point bucks in the field.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's calculate the points collected by each student:

1. Adam has 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. So, Betty's points are \(50 + (0.30 \times 50) = 50 + 15 = 65\) points.
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom's points are \(65 - 30 = 35\) points.
4. Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. So, Martha's points are \(3 \times 35 = 105\) points.

Now, let's sum up the points collected by all the students:
\[50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255\]

The class needs a total of 400 points to go on the trip. Therefore, the points the class is missing are:

The class is missing \(\boxed{145}\) points to go on the trip."
"To determine the number of great-grandbabies at the family reunion, we can break down the family structure step by step.

1. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.
2. Each of her children has 3 children of their own, which means there are \(3 \times 3 = 9\) grandchildren.
3. Each of these grandchildren has 3 babies of their own, which means there are \(9 \times 3 = 27\) great-grandbabies.

Therefore, the number of great-grandbabies at the family reunion is 27."
"First, let's calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400 paycheck into her retirement account:

\[ 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

So, she puts $1200 into her retirement account.

Next, we calculate how much she uses for her monthly car payment. She uses 20% of her $2400 paycheck for her car payment:

\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

So, she uses $480 for her car payment.

Now, we subtract the amounts she put into her retirement account and used for her car payment from her total paycheck to find out how much money she has left to spend:

\[ 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Therefore, Greta has $720 left to spend."

"First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks set off by the city:

- The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each.
- Total fireworks from the city = 15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = 300 fireworks.

Hannah will see 40% of these fireworks:

- Hannah's view = 40% of 300 fireworks = 0.40 * 300 = 120 fireworks.

Next, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard:

- Hannah is setting off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each.
- Total fireworks from Hannah = 3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = 15 fireworks.

Now, we add the fireworks Hannah sees from the city and the fireworks she sets off herself:

- Total fireworks Hannah sees = 120 fireworks (from the city) + 15 fireworks (from her backyard) = 135 fireworks.

Therefore, Hannah will see a total of 135 fireworks."
"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person saves a seat and buys enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats. Since each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks, and there are 20 people, the group will buy:

- \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) drinks
- \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) snacks

Each drink and snack costs $2, so the total cost for drinks is:

\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

And the total cost for snacks is:

\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount spent on drinks and snacks:

\[ 80 + 120 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the group has spent a total of:

\[ \boxed{200} \] dollars on snacks and drinks."
"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we can calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4,000 \text{ pounds} + 800 \text{ pounds} = 4,800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. We can use this information to find out how much Gary's truck can haul. We already know the capacities of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + \text{Gordy's truck capacity} + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11,600 \text{ pounds} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 4,000 \text{ pounds} + 4,800 \text{ pounds} + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11,600 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we can solve for Gary's truck capacity:

\[ 8,800 \text{ pounds} + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11,600 \text{ pounds} \]

\[ \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11,600 \text{ pounds} - 8,800 \text{ pounds} \]

\[ \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 2,800 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females.

1. Each female ate 3 dumplings.
2. There are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is \(6 \times 3 = 18\).

3. Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate \(3 + 1 = 4\) dumplings.
4. There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is \(8 \times 4 = 32\).

5. The total number of dumplings cooked is the sum of dumplings eaten by males and females, which is \(18 + 32 = 50\).

Therefore, Larry cooked 50 dumplings."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much money Gerald and Julia each received when they divided $100 in the ratio 3:2.

The total parts of the ratio 3:2 add up to 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Each part is therefore worth $100 / 5 = $20.

Gerald's share, being 3 parts, is 3 * $20 = $60.

Julia's share, being 2 parts, is 2 * $20 = $40.

Now, if Gerald spent $10 on a book, the amount of money he has left is $60 - $10 = $50.

Therefore, Gerald has $50 left."
"First, let's determine the speed of Martha's turtle. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

The cat's speed is 15 feet/second. So, the turtle's speed is:

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now, to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Turtle's speed} \times \text{Time} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find out how many more hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first need to determine how much more money they need to raise. 

The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount they need to raise is:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money they raise per hour. They raised $2100 in the first 3 hours, so the amount raised per hour is:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Now, to find out how many more hours they need to fundraise to raise the remaining $4200, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

So, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours. 

Therefore, the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal is:

\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]

**Final Answer: 9**"
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract the industrial usage percentage from the total city usage percentage to find the non-industrial usage percentage.

Step 1: The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. So, the industrial usage is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 \text{ or } 32\% \]

Step 2: Subtract the industrial usage from the total city usage to find the non-industrial usage:
\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

Therefore, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

Therefore, Alex charges $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the production rate for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream and then calculate the total production over 48 hours.

First, let's find the production rate for chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Next, let's find the production rate for vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Now, we calculate the total production over 48 hours for both types of ice cream:
- For chocolate ice cream: \( 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).
- For vanilla ice cream: \( 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Finally, we add the production of both types of ice cream to get the total production:
- Total production = \( 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \).

Therefore, the total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 3000 quarts."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Marcus ordered:

- Croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each = 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each = 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 muffins at $1.00 each = 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost before the discount:

Total cost = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off, we need to calculate 10% of $50.00 and subtract it from the total:

10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Subtract the discount from the total cost:

Total bill after discount = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is $45.00."
"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can get with $6.00, we need to consider the deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's calculate the cost of 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free):
\[ 3 \text{ scoops} \times \$1.50 \text{ per scoop} = \$4.50 \]

Now, we need to see how many sets of 3 scoops Erin can buy with $6.00:
\[ \frac{\$6.00}{\$4.50 \text{ per 3 scoops}} = \frac{6}{4.5} = \frac{60}{45} = \frac{4}{3} \approx 1.33 \]

Since Erin can only buy whole sets of 3 scoops, she can buy 1 set of 3 scoops. This means she gets 3 scoops in total.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy each person eats in two weeks and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total amount of candy Ginger eats in two weeks:
- Ginger eats 4 pieces a day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- So, Ginger eats \(4 \times 14 = 56\) pieces of candy in two weeks.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of candy Amy eats in two weeks:
- Amy eats 3 pieces a day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- So, Amy eats \(3 \times 14 = 42\) pieces of candy in two weeks.

Now, we need to find out how much candy each person has left after two weeks:
- Ginger started with 100 pieces and ate 56 pieces, so she has \(100 - 56 = 44\) pieces left.
- Amy started with 100 pieces and ate 42 pieces, so she has \(100 - 42 = 58\) pieces left.

Finally, we need to find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger:
- Amy has 58 pieces and Ginger has 44 pieces.
- The difference is \(58 - 44 = 14\).

So, after two weeks, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger.

"First, we need to determine the area that Mr. Boarden wants to cover, which is two thirds of his 36 square feet bathroom.

\[ \text{Area to cover} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \, \text{sq ft} \]

\[ \text{Area to cover} = 24 \, \text{sq ft} \]

Next, we know that for every square foot, Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles. Therefore, for 24 square feet, the number of tiles required would be:

\[ \text{Number of tiles} = 24 \, \text{sq ft} \times 24 \, \text{tiles/sq ft} \]

\[ \text{Number of tiles} = 576 \]

So, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 square feet bathroom."
"To determine how much James saved, we need to calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries and compare it to the cost of buying the same amount at the store.

1. **Cost of picking the blueberries:**
   - Initial cost to go picking: $20
   - Cost per pound: $1.5
   - Pounds of blueberries picked: 30

   Total cost for picking = Initial cost + (Cost per pound * Pounds picked)
   Total cost for picking = $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
   Total cost for picking = $20 + $45
   Total cost for picking = $65

2. **Cost of buying the blueberries at the store:**
   - Cost per pound at the store: $2.5

   - The city council will fine Ron $120 for fixing it himself.
   - Therefore, the total cost if the city fixes it is $450 (damage to car) - $120 (fine) = $330.

2. **Cost of Ron fixing the pothole himself:**
   - Ron will have to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, each costing $25.
   - The total cost for the asphalt is 3 buckets * $25/bucket = $75.
   - Ron will also have to pay the $120 fine for unauthorized road maintenance.
   - Therefore, the total cost if Ron fixes it himself is $75 (asphalt) + $120 (fine) = $195.

3. **Savings by fixing the pothole himself:**
   - The savings is the difference between the cost of having the city fix it and the cost of Ron fixing it himself.
   - Savings = $330 (city fixing) - $195 (Ron fixing) = $135.

Ron saves $135 by fixing the pothole himself.

**Final Answer:**
$135"
"To find out how many chairs the restaurant has left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

First, we calculate the remaining normal chairs:
170 normal chairs - 20 normal chairs sent for repair = 150 normal chairs left.

Next, we calculate the remaining baby chairs:
23 baby chairs - 13 baby chairs sent for repair = 10 baby chairs left.

Now, we add the remaining normal and baby chairs to get the total number of chairs left:
150 normal chairs + 10 baby chairs = 160 chairs.

The restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pizzas ordered. Since there are 5 people (Bryce and his four friends) and each ordered one pizza, the total number of pizzas is 5.

Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate how many slices each group of friends ate.

Bryce and two friends ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas. Since there are 3 people in this group, the total number of slices they ate is:
\[ 3 \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \times 12 \right) = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

The two remaining friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas. So, the total number of slices they ate is:
\[ 2 \times \left( \frac{3}{4} \times 12 \right) = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Now, we add the slices eaten by both groups to find the total number of slices eaten:
\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices to find the number of slices left:
\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \]

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is:
\[ 18 \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. The dog can eat the sausages in \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the time the cat takes. Since the cat takes 30 minutes, the dog takes:

\[ 30 \times \frac{2}{3} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, to find the average time the two take to eat the sausages, we add the time it takes for the cat and the dog to eat the sausages and then divide by 2:

\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

The average time the two take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches.
2. Set up an equation based on the given relationship between Topher's and Bobby's shoe lengths.
3. Solve the equation for the length of Bobby's shoe.

First, let's convert Topher's shoe length to inches. Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the feet to inches and then add the additional 4 inches:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]
\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, Topher's shoe is 100 inches long.

Next, we know that the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as \( x \) inches. According to the problem, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To find out how many windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for both students' cars and teachers' cars, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, each with 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The number of students' cars' windows smashed is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 64 \times 4 = 64 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, each with 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows.

The number of teachers' cars' windows smashed is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 32 \times 2 = 48 \]

Now, we add the number of windows smashed for both students' and teachers' cars:
\[ 64 + 48 = 112 \]

Therefore, Hannah smashes a total of 112 windows."
"To find the percentage of spools that are blue, we first need to determine the total number of spools and the number of blue spools.

Candy has:
- 15 light blue spools
- 45 dark blue spools
- 40 light green spools
- 50 dark green spools

The total number of spools is:
15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 spools

The number of blue spools is:
15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60 blue spools

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\% \]

Therefore, 40% of her spools are blue."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 5000 people in line to vote.

2. By midday, 2/5 of the people have voted. So, the number of people who have voted by midday is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000
   \]
   Therefore, the number of people remaining in line by midday is:
   \[
   5000 - 2000 = 3000
   \]

3. By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people have voted. So, the number of people who have voted by 16:00 is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000
   \]
   Therefore, the number of people remaining in line by 16:00 is:
   \[
   3000 - 2000 = 1000
   \]

So, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is \(\boxed{1000}\)."
"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need for 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will need for 30 days.
2. Determine how many packs of gum are required based on the number of pieces per pack.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces of gum needed.
Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. For 30 days, he will need:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Step 2: Determine the number of packs needed.
Each pack contains 15 pieces of gum. To find out how many packs are needed for 120 pieces, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of smores needed:**
   - **Kids:** 9 kids want 2 smores each, so \(9 \times 2 = 18\) smores.
   - **Adults:** 6 adults want 1 smore each, so \(6 \times 1 = 6\) smores.
   - **Total smores needed:** \(18 + 6 = 24\) smores.

2. **Calculate the number of smores that can be made from one box of graham crackers:**
   - Each sleeve makes 8 smores.
   - There are 3 sleeves in a box, so \(3 \times 8 = 24\) smores per box.

3. **Determine the number of boxes needed:**
   - Since 24 smores are needed and 24 smores can be made from one box, they will need \( \frac{24}{24} = 1 \) box.

Therefore, they will need **1 box** of graham crackers."
"First, let's calculate Dora's father's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, and her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age, we can write the equation for her father's age as:

\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 \]

Substituting Dora's age (15) into the equation:

\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we calculate Dora's mother's age. Since Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father:

\[ \text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother by adding their ages together:

\[ \text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} \]
\[ \text{Total combined age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

Therefore, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87."
"To find out how much money each of them got, we need to divide the total amount of money by the number of people sharing it. Greg and his 3 younger siblings make a total of 4 people.

- French book: 4 pounds.
- English book: 3 pounds.
- History book: twice the weight of the English book, so \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds.

Now, we add all these weights together:

\[4 \text{ (math and science)} + 4 \text{ (French)} + 3 \text{ (English)} + 6 \text{ (history)} = 17 \text{ pounds}\]

The total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds."

\[ 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ votes} \]

The total votes for candidates A and B are:
\[ 20 + 30 = 50 \text{ votes} \]

Since there were 100 voters in total, the number of votes for candidate C is:
\[ 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ votes} \]

Candidate C got 50 votes."
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, Beck has:

\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Next, if Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Boris will have:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]

And Beck will have:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this exchange, we subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris.

"To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract that from the initial 32 ounces.

1. **Giant Cubes:**
   - Each giant cube uses 4 ounces.
   - Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   - Total water used for giant cubes = 3 * 4 ounces = 12 ounces.

2. **Medium Cubes:**
   - Each medium cube uses 2 ounces.
   - Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   - Total water used for medium cubes = 7 * 2 ounces = 14 ounces.

3. **Small Cubes:**
   - Each small cube uses 1/2 ounce.
   - Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   - Total water used for small cubes = 8 * 1/2 ounce = 4 ounces.

Now, we add up the total water used for all the cubes:
- Total water used = 12 ounces (giant) + 14 ounces (medium) + 4 ounces (small) = 30 ounces.

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial 32 ounces:
- Water left = 32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces.

\[ \text{Steven's books} = \frac{\text{Clara's books}}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so:

\[ \text{Alice's books} = \text{Steven's books} + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:

\[ \text{Clara's books} - \text{Alice's books} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Clara has 4 more books than Alice."
"Given that a gallon jar costs $5 and it costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can determine the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

\[ \text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]
\[ \text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money spent:

- On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which means he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches.

Now, let's add up all the matches Joey played throughout the week:

- Matches on Monday: 2
- Matches on Friday: 1
- Matches on Saturday: 4

Total matches played in one week = \(2 + 1 + 4 = 7\)

Joey played 7 matches in one week."
"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against the regulation. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into this expression:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 22 \)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need size extra-small.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra-small. So, \(2 \times 11 = 22\) students need size small.
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So, \(22 - 4 = 18\) students need size medium.
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. So, \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\) students need size large.
5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. So, \(9 + 6 = 15\) students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up all the shirts needed:

- XS: 11
- S: 22
- M: 18
- L: 9
- XL: 15

Total number of shirts = \(11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75\)

"To find out how many puppies Jana has, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Pomeranians.
2. Use the total number of Pomeranians to find the total number of puppies.

Given that one third of the Pomeranians are girls and there are 6 Pomeranian girls, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times \text{Total Pomeranians} = 6
\]

Solving for the total number of Pomeranians:

\[
\text{Total Pomeranians} = 6 \times 3 = 18
\]

Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times \text{Total Puppies} = 18

"First, let's calculate how much money Ava gave to Jayden. Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, so:

\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Now, let's add the money Jayden originally had to the money Ava gave him:

\[ 70 + 45 = 115 \]

The camera costs $200, so to find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the total amount of money he has from the cost of the camera:

\[ 200 - 115 = 85 \]

Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera."
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3.5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 3.5:
\[ x = \frac{250}{3.5} = 71.42857142857143 \]

Since the third house needs \( 2x \) cases of shingles, we calculate:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 71.42857142857143 = 142.85714285714286 \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number (since you can't have a fraction of a case of shingles), the third house will need 143 cases of shingles.

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of time Tatiana has for her weekend activities:

Total time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Next, we subtract the time she spends reading:

Time left after reading = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

Now, she plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time:

Time spent on video games = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

So, the time left for playing soccer is:

Time for soccer = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time for soccer}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Points from enemies:**
   - Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
   - Points for each enemy = 10.
   - So, the difference in points from enemies = 8 * 10 = 80 points.

2. **Points from berries:**
   - Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
   - Points for each berry = 5.
   - So, the difference in points from berries = 3 * 5 = 15 points.

3. **Points from the timer:**
   - Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma.
   - Points for each second = -30 (since it's subtracted for each second slower).
   - So, the difference in points from the timer = 4 * (-30) = -120 points.

Now, let's calculate the total difference in scores:

- Difference from enemies: +80 points
- Difference from berries: +15 points
- Difference from the timer: -120 points

So, the difference between their two scores is -25 points. This means Emma's score is 25 points higher than Ava's."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The total cost of the four pizzas is $64.
2. Two of the pizzas cost $30 in total.
3. We need to find the cost of each of the other two pizzas, which cost the same amount.

First, we calculate the total cost of the other two pizzas:
\[ \text{Total cost of four pizzas} - \text{Total cost of two pizzas} = \text{Total cost of other two pizzas} \]
\[ 64 - 30 = 34 \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of these two pizzas by 2:
\[ \text{Cost of each of the other two pizzas} = \frac{34}{2} = 17 \]

So, each of the other two pizzas cost $17.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond: 3 orange and 4 white.

He bought 17 more fish from the pet store, and after adding these to his pond, the number of orange fish became twice the number of white fish.

Let's denote the number of orange fish he bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish he bought as \( W \). Therefore, \( O + W = 17 \).

After adding the new fish, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + O \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + W \).

According to the problem, after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Now, let's solve these equations.

First, simplify the equation:
\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]
\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

We also have the equation from the total number of fish bought:
\[ O + W = 17 \]

We can solve these two equations simultaneously. From the second equation, we can express \( O \) in terms of \( W \):
\[ O = 17 - W \]

Substitute this expression for \( O \) into the first equation:
\[ 17 - W - 2W = 5 \]
\[ 17 - 3W = 5 \]
\[ -3W = 5 - 17 \]
\[ -3W = -12 \]
\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

Final answer:

"First, we need to determine the temperature during the night. If it's 33 degrees colder at night than during the day, and the day temperature is 45 degrees, then the night temperature is:

45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, Carson needs to raise the temperature from 12 degrees to 32 degrees. The difference in temperature that needs to be raised is:

32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees

Each log of wood burns raises the temperature by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn to raise the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the temperature difference by the temperature increase per log:

20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing."

2. Calculate the value of the bottle caps he finds in a day.
3. Multiply the daily value by the number of days in the month.

Step 1: Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day.

Step 2: Each bottle cap is worth $0.25, so the value of the bottle caps he finds in a day is:
\[ 10 \text{ bottle caps/day} \times \$0.25/\text{bottle cap} = \$2.50/\text{day} \]

Step 3: To find out how much money he makes in a 30-day month, we multiply the daily value by 30:
\[ \$2.50/\text{day} \times 30 \text{ days} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, Damien makes \(\$75.00\) in a 30-day month."
"Jamie's regular hourly rate is $20 per hour. For the additional hours worked beyond her regular 8-hour day, she is paid at a rate of 150% of her regular hourly rate.

First, calculate the special hourly rate for the additional hours:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } \$20 = 1.5 \times \$20 = \$30 \text{ per hour} \]

On Tuesday, Jamie worked 11 hours. The first 8 hours are paid at her regular rate, and the remaining 3 hours are paid at the special rate.

Calculate the pay for the first 8 hours:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$160 \]

Calculate the pay for the additional 3 hours:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$90 \]

Add the two amounts to find the total pay for the day:
\[ \$160 + \$90 = \$250 \]

Therefore, Jamie was paid \(\$250\) for her work on Tuesday."
"The zookeeper counts 12 female lions. There are half as many male lions, which means there are 12 / 2 = 6 male lions. Additionally, there are 14 lion cubs.

To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and cubs together:

12 (female lions) + 6 (male lions) + 14 (cubs) = 32 lions

So, there are 32 lions in the enclosure."
"First, we need to calculate the discount on the jeans. The jeans are 25% off, and the original price is $40. 

To find the discount amount, we calculate 25% of $40:
\[ 25\% \times 40 = 0.25 \times 40 = 10 \]

So, the discount is $10. 

Next, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

The sale price of the jeans is $30. 

Mike pays with a $50.00 bill. To find out how much money he will have left over, we subtract the sale price of the jeans from the amount he paid:
\[ 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, Mike will have $20.00 left over."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Billy's Salary Calculation:**
   - Billy's starting hourly rate: $10 per hour.
   - After 2 months, his hourly rate increased by $0.50, so his new rate is $10.50 per hour.
   - On his first anniversary, his hourly rate increased by $1.00, so his final rate is $11.50 per hour.
   - If Billy works 20 hours, his earnings are: $11.50 * 20 = $230.

2. **Sally's Salary Calculation:**
   - Sally's starting hourly rate is $0.50 more than Billy's starting rate, so her starting rate is $10.50 per hour.
   - If Sally works 20 hours, her earnings are: $10.50 * 20 = $210.

3. **Difference in Earnings:**
   - The difference in earnings between Billy and Sally is: $230 - $210 = $20.

So, Billy will earn $20 more than Sally."
"To find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels, we need to calculate the total cost of each and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of 3 loaves of bread:
- Each loaf of bread costs $2.
- Therefore, 3 loaves of bread cost \(3 \times 2 = 6\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of 2 bagels:
- Each bagel costs $1.
- Therefore, 2 bagels cost \(2 \times 1 = 2\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference between the cost of 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels:
- The difference is \(6 - 2 = 4\) dollars.

So, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels."
"First, let's find out how many points Nikita scored. We know that Nikita scored 11 more than half as many points as Pierson. Pierson scored 278 points.

Half of Pierson's points is:
\[ \frac{278}{2} = 139 \]

Nikita scored 11 more than this amount, so:
\[ 139 + 11 = 150 \]

Now, to find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we add their scores together:
\[ 278 + 150 = 428 \]

So, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is:
428"
"To calculate the total number of trees planted, we need to consider both the students and the teachers' contributions.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students:
- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has 25 students.
- Each student plants 1 tree.

So, the total number of trees planted by the students is:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has 3 teachers.
- Each teacher plants 2 trees.

So, the total number of trees planted by the teachers is:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Now, we add the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers to get the total number of trees planted:
\[ 1000 \text{ trees} + 240 \text{ trees} = 1240 \text{ trees} \]

Therefore, at the end of the campaign, they will have planted 1240 trees."
"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 stuffed animals

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 0.30 \times (14 + x) = x \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30x = x \]
\[ 4.2 + 0.30x = x \]
\[ 4.2 = x - 0.30x \]
\[ 4.2 = 0.70x \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

Final numerical answer: 6"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the first part of her schedule:

- She plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks have 14 days.
- Half an hour each day for 14 days is \(0.5 \times 14 = 7\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the total hours for the second part of her schedule:

- She plays for 2 hours every day for a week, which is 7 days.
- 2 hours each day for 7 days is \(2 \times 7 = 14\) hours.

Now, let's add the hours from both parts of her schedule:

- Total hours played = \(7 + 14 = 21\) hours.

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. So, the number of hours she still needs to play is:

- \(30 - 21 = 9\) hours.

Therefore, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. The first car travels at 60 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it will travel:
   \[
   60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. The second car travels at 70 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it will travel:
   \[
   70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. The difference in distance between the second car and the first car after 2 hours is:
   \[
   140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}
   \]

So, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car. 

The final numerical answer is:
20 miles"
"To find out how much James paid for the ring, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the materials (diamond and gold).
2. Calculate the 30% premium on the total cost of the materials.
3. Add the premium to the total cost of the materials to get the final amount James paid.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the materials.
The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300.
Total cost of materials = $600 + $300 = $900

Step 2: Calculate the 30% premium.
30% of $900 = 0.30 * $900 = $270

Step 3: Add the premium to the total cost of the materials.
Final amount paid = Total cost of materials + Premium
Final amount paid = $900 + $270 = $1170

Therefore, James paid $1170 for the ring."
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students, then divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students.

First, let's calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
- Fourth graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
- Fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders, so it's \(2 \times \frac{40}{100} = \frac{80}{100} = 0.8\). Therefore, 400 fifth graders had \(400 \times 0.8 = 320\) pass.

Now, let's sum up the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total students who passed: \(340 + 40 + 320 = 680\)
- Total students: \(500 + 100 + 400 = 1000\)

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students:

\[
\text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{680}{1000} = 0.68
\]

Expressing this as a percentage, the overall pass rate is \(68\%\).

The school's overall pass rate is 68%."
"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of the mosaic he can make with the total number of chips.
3. Calculate the length of the mosaic given its height.

First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has in total. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:
\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to determine how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, the number of square inches he can make is:
\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long the mosaic can be, we divide the total area by the height:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the length of the mosaic Milo can make is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts, so the total amount they drank is:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts, so the total amount they drank is:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts. Therefore, the total amount of tea in gallons is:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Final numerical answer:
12 gallons"
"Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 butterscotch candies, which means he needed to order more to meet the demand. He then ordered an additional 100 candies. 

To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and then subtract the number of candies he has already sold.

Total candies = Initial candies + Additional ordered candies
Total candies = 100 + 100 = 200

Candies sold = 150

Candies still to be sold = Total candies - Candies sold
Candies still to be sold = 200 - 150 = 50

Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month, starting from the beginning of the year, and then find the difference between the number of students at the end of May and the initial number of students.

1. **Beginning of the year (January):** 10 students
2. **End of January:** The number of students doubles, so \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
3. **End of February:** The number of students doubles again, so \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
4. **End of March:** The number of students doubles again, so \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
5. **End of April:** The number of students doubles again, so \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
6. **End of May:** The number of students doubles again, so \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

Now, we need to find the additional students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year.

The number of students at the beginning of the year is 10, and by the end of May, there are 320 students. The additional students that joined are:

\[320 - 10 = 310\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

310"
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. During the week, he made $105. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25} = 420 \text{ branches} \]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420 \text{ branches}}{7 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ branches/day} \]

Therefore, on average, Felix climbed 60 branches per day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picked:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\]

Next, we account for the flowers that were dropped. She drops 1 of each type of flower, so she drops:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\]

Subtracting the petals of the dropped flowers from the initial total gives:
\[101 - 22 = 79\]

So, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:
\[79\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores:

- John makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.
- DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.

Total marshmallows used by both = 9 (John) + 9 (DeSean) = 18 marshmallows.

Next, we need to account for the marshmallows that were dropped on the ground:

- Marshmallows dropped = 3.

Now, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows that are no longer available for making S'mores:

- Total marshmallows used + marshmallows dropped = 18 + 3 = 21 marshmallows.

The original number of marshmallows in the bag was 35. So, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is:

- Marshmallows left = Original number - Total used and dropped = 35 - 21 = 14 marshmallows.

Since John and DeSean are sharing the remaining marshmallows equally, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2:

- Marshmallows each can have = 14 / 2 = 7 marshmallows.

So, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Jack's Game Time:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
   - They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.
   - Jack's total game time is 240 minutes.
   - The number of quarters Jack uses is \( \frac{240}{20} = 12 \) quarters.

2. **Friends' Game Times:**
   - Two friends can play half as long as Jack, so they can play for \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) minutes per quarter.
   - The better friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for \( 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \) minutes per quarter.
   - The total game time for the two friends who play half as long is \( \frac{240}{10} = 24 \) quarters each.
   - The total game time for the better friend is \( \frac{240}{30} = 8 \) quarters.

3. **Total Quarters Used:**
   - Jack uses 12 quarters.
   - Each of the two friends who play half as long uses 24 quarters, so together they use \( 24 \times 2 = 48 \) quarters.
   - The better friend uses 8 quarters.
   - The total number of quarters used is \( 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 \) quarters.

Therefore, the total amount of money used is 68 quarters."
"Let's denote the amount of citrus zest used as \( z \) ounces. Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.

The amount of salt used is \( s \) ounces. Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.

The amount of oil used is \( 2s \) ounces because it is twice the amount of salt.

According to the problem, the amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so we have:
\[ s = 2z \]

The total amount of ingredients used is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total amount of ingredients as:
\[ s + s + z + z + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 4s + 2z = 10 \]

Substituting \( s = 2z \) into the equation:
\[ 4(2z) + 2z = 10 \]
\[ 8z + 2z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find \( s \):
\[ s = 2z = 2 \times 1 = 2 \]

The amount of oil used is \( 2s \):
\[ 2s = 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Therefore, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil."
"To find out how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows, then add these two amounts together.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John bought 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John bought 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the overall amount spent:
- Total cost of goats: $1500
- Total cost of cows: $3000
- Therefore, the total amount spent is \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes for the party. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, which adds up to 48 cupcakes.

To find out how many more cupcakes Paul should buy, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number he needs:

63 (total needed) - 48 (already has) = 15

Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"First, let's determine how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. So, the number of cars he gives away is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of cars Joe has after selling and giving some away. He initially had 40 cars, sold 8, and gave away 16, so the number of cars he remains with is:

\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Therefore, Joe remains with 16 cars after selling and giving some to his mother."
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount raised by the students.
2. Divide this amount by the number of students.

First, we know the total amount raised for the charity is $175,000. Out of this, $50,000 comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to divide this amount by the number of students, which is 20:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\)."
"On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. On the second day, she walked half as many hours, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we add the hours from both days: 8 + 4 = 12 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total hours into minutes: 12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes.

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars entered, making the total:

50 + 20 = 70 cars

When he got out for lunch, half of the cars left the parking lot. So, the number of cars that left is:

70 / 2 = 35 cars

Therefore, the total number of cars left in the parking lot during lunch break is:

70 - 35 = 35 cars

The total number of cars he counted during lunch break is 35."
"To calculate how much John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tasks John does in a day.
2. Calculate the total number of tasks John does in a week.
3. Calculate the total earnings based on the number of tasks and the pay per task.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of tasks per day.
John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 tasks.
So, the total number of tasks per day is \(30 \times 5 = 150\).

Step 2: Calculate the total number of tasks per week.
Since John works 7 days a week, the total number of tasks per week is \(150 \times 7 = 1050\).

Step 3: Calculate the total earnings.
Each task pays $1.20, so the total earnings for the week are \(1050 \times 1.20 = 1260\).

Therefore, John makes $1260 in a full 7-day week."
"In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. However, we are asked for the total points Sasha scored, not Julie's.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add the points from both games together: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

Sasha scored a total of 18 points during both games."

- Each package contains 6 tins.
- Therefore, the total number of tins of dog food is \(6 \times 6 = 36\).

Now, we find the difference between the total number of tins of cat food and dog food:
- The difference is \(88 - 36 = 52\).

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food."
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have:
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.
3. She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs:

- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

Total number of eggs = \(5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27\)

Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the refund she will receive and the cost of the return shipping. Then, we'll subtract the refund from the original cost of the book to find the net loss.

1. **Calculate the refund:**
   - The book's purchase price is $32.
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price.
   - Refund = $32 * 0.75 = $24.

2. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds.
   - The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
   - Shipping cost for weight = 4 * $0.35 = $1.40.
   - The book needs to be returned 20 miles.
   - The shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
   - Shipping cost for distance = 20 * $0.08 = $1.60.
   - Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - Original cost of the book = $32.
   - Refund = $24.
   - Net loss = Original cost - Refund - Shipping cost = $32 - $24 - $3 = $5.

Milly will lose $5."
"Mulan starts with $40 and her father gives her $100, so she has:

$40 + $100 = $140

She then buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, which costs:

2 * $30 = $60

And she buys a bag for $20. So the total cost of her purchases is:

$60 + $20 = $80

Subtracting the total cost of her purchases from her total money gives:

$140 - $80 = $60

Mulan has $60 left."
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the production for the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total monthly production.

1. First week production: 8,000 bars
2. Second week production: Half of the first week, which is \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars
3. Third week production: Three times the first week, which is \( 8,000 \times 3 = 24,000 \) bars

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \] bars

Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. So, the production for the fourth week is:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \] bars

Therefore, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week."
"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to consider the time she spends on video creation, songwriting, and makeup.

1. **Video Creation:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the time spent on video creation per week is \(18 \times 4 = 72\) minutes.

2. **Songwriting:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, 2 hours = \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.

3. **Makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - Therefore, the time spent on makeup per week is \(15 \times 6 = 90\) minutes.

Now, let's add up the time spent on all these activities per week:
\[72 \text{ (video creation)} + 120 \text{ (songwriting)} + 90 \text{ (makeup)} = 282 \text{ minutes per week}\]

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total time spent on TikTok in a month is:
\[282 \times 4 = 1128 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
1128 minutes"
"To calculate the total cost for Angela, we need to break down the charges based on the information provided.

1. **Base Installation Cost**: The base cost for hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures is $129.00.

2. **Additional Items**:
   - Angela needs 6 mirrors, but the base cost already includes 4 mirrors. So, she needs 2 additional mirrors.
   - She needs 2 chandeliers, but the base cost already includes 1 chandelier. So, she needs 1 additional chandelier.
   - She needs 20 pictures, but the base cost already includes 10 pictures. So, she needs 10 additional pictures.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - Additional mirrors: 2 mirrors * $15.00 per item = $30.00
   - Additional chandeliers: 1 chandelier * $15.00 per item = $15.00
   - Additional pictures: 10 pictures * $15.00 per item = $150.00

4. **Total Additional Cost**: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

5. **Total Cost**: Base installation cost + Total additional cost = $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00

**Final Answer**: $324.00"
"First, let's determine how much money Anthony has saved. Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + \$10.00 = \$20.00 + \$10.00 = \$30.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. According to the problem, Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:

\[ 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times \$30.00 = \$12.00 \]

Therefore, Roy's savings are:

\[ \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = \$30.00 + \$12.00 = \$42.00 \]

So, the amount of money Roy has is:

\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain in feet, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Pompei's lifting capacity**: Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. **Saskay's lifting capacity**: Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches high.
3. **Kagiyami's lifting capacity**: Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches high.
4. **Naruto's lifting capacity**: Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches high.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 480 inches to feet by dividing by 12:

\[ \frac{480 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high."
"Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour. 

For the first part of his journey, he travels for 4 hours. The distance covered in this part is:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

After resting, he travels for another 6 hours. The distance covered in this part is:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the distances from both parts of his journey gives the total distance:
\[ 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for four turtles to travel the same distance that three kangaroos travel in 18 hours, given that each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo.

First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos and the distance they travel. If three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel a certain distance, we can denote the distance as \(D\) and the speed of each kangaroo as \(S\). The total distance \(D\) can be calculated as:

\[ D = 3 \times S \times 18 \]

Now, let's consider the speed of the turtles. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{S}{2} \).

We need to find the time it takes for four turtles to travel the same distance \(D\). Let's denote the time it takes for the turtles as \(T\). The distance \(D\) can also be expressed in terms of the turtles' speed and time as:

\[ D = 4 \times \frac{S}{2} \times T \]

Since the distance \(D\) is the same in both cases, we can set the two expressions for \(D\) equal to each other:

\[ 3 \times S \times 18 = 4 \times \frac{S}{2} \times T \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 3 \times S \times 18 = 2 \times S \times T \]

We can cancel \(S\) from both sides of the equation (assuming \(S \neq 0\)):

\[ 3 \times 18 = 2 \times T \]

\[ 54 = 2 \times T \]

Solving for \(T\):

\[ T = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

So, it will take four turtles 27 hours to travel the same distance. 

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"Given that Kora made 20 dishes, we can use this information to find out how many dishes Rory and Jada made.

1. Kora made 20 dishes.
2. Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made \(20 + 20 = 40\) dishes.
3. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made \(2 \times 40 = 80\) dishes.

To find the total number of dishes they all made together, we add the number of dishes each person made:

\[20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140\]

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is 140."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The cost of the new laptop is $600.
2. If Erika trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, making the new price $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 this week and her mom gives her $80, so she has $150 + $80 = $230 from these sources.
4. Erika still needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop.

To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to subtract the amount she still needs from the total amount she has:

Total amount Erika has = $230
Amount still needed = $50

So, the amount Erika has in her purse is $230 - $50 = $180.

Therefore, Erika has $180 in her purse."
"First, let's calculate the total number of apple slices Adam gets from slicing the apples.

- From 3 large apples, he gets \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices.
- From 5 small apples, he gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.

So, the total number of slices is \(15 + 15 = 30\).

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is \(30 - 15 = 15\).

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is 15."
"The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk a day from one cow. Therefore, with 3 cows, he extracts:

\[ 5 \, \text{liters/cow} \times 3 \, \text{cows} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, he needs:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed is:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and then sum these lengths.

1. The first glue stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left, so \( \frac{5}{6} \) is not used. Since each glue stick is 12 millimeters long, the unused portion of the first glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left, so \( \frac{1}{3} \) is not used. The unused portion of the second glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left, so \( \frac{1}{2} \) is not used. The unused portion of the third glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we sum the unused portions of all three glue sticks:
\[
10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \text{ millimeters}
\]

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 millimeters."
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the car and the phone, and then subtract the amount of money he already has.

The total cost of the car and the phone is:
$10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800

Gabriel has:
$5000 (from working on weekends) + $200 (from his brother) = $5200

"Craig starts with 2 twenty dollar bills, which amounts to:

2 * $20 = $40

He spends $2 on each of the six squirt guns, so the total spent on squirt guns is:

6 * $2 = $12

He also spends $3 on each of the three packs of water balloons, so the total spent on water balloons is:

3 * $3 = $9

The total amount spent is the sum of the money spent on squirt guns and water balloons:

$12 + $9 = $21

To find out how much money Craig has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money he had:

$40 - $21 = $19

Therefore, Craig has $19 left."
"Given:
- Jack collected 60 dishes.
- Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) socks.
- Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
- Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
- Jack's total: \( 30 \) socks + \( 60 \) dishes = \( 90 \)
- Peter's total: \( 60 \) socks + \( 30 \) dishes = \( 90 \)

Together, they have \( 90 + 90 = 180 \).

"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

- 5 students are good at math only.
- The rest of the students are good at both math and English. Since there are 20 students in total and 5 are good at math only, the number of students who are good at both subjects is \(20 - 5 - 8 = 7\).

So, the total number of students good at math (both only and both) is \(5 + 7 = 12\).

Therefore, the number of students good at math is 12."
"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group takes to perform and then see how many such time slots fit into the total concert duration, including the intermission.

Each group's performance time is composed of:
- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

So, the total time for each group is:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

The concert duration is 2 hours, which is:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

However, there is a 10-minute intermission, so the actual time available for performances is:
\[ 120 - 10 = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we divide the available performance time by the time each group needs:
\[ \frac{110}{10} = 11 \]

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:
11

So, the final numerical answer is:
11"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the simple interest earned over 3 years and then add it to the original investment.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Principal (P) = $300
- Rate (R) = three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\% \) or 2.25 in decimal form
- Time (T) = 3 years

Now, we can calculate the simple interest:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 \]

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 6.75 \]

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 2025 \]

The total amount after 3 years will be the original principal plus the simple interest:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 2025 \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 2325 \]

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $2325."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total white shirts**: 40
2. **Total floral shirts**: 50

**White shirts with collars**:
- Half of the white shirts have collars, so \( \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \) white shirts have collars.

**White shirts with no collars**:
- Since 20 white shirts have collars, the remaining white shirts have no collars. So, \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) white shirts have no collars.

**Floral shirts with buttons**:
- 20 floral shirts have buttons.

**Floral shirts with no buttons**:
- Since there are 50 floral shirts in total and 20 have buttons, the remaining floral shirts have no buttons. So, \( 50 - 20 = 30 \) floral shirts have no buttons.

**Difference between floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars**:
- We need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars. So, we subtract the number of white shirts with no collars from the number of floral shirts with no buttons.
- \( 30 - 20 = 10 \)

Therefore, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars."
"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we first need to determine how many trays he can fill with 900 eggs, given that each tray holds 30 eggs. 

\[ \text{Number of trays} = \frac{\text{Total number of eggs}}{\text{Eggs per tray}} = \frac{900}{30} = 30 \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray.

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of trays} \times \text{Price per tray} = 30 \times 2.5 = 75 \]

The farmer will earn $75 if he sells all the trays of eggs."
"Initially, Mr. Smith has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y.

He sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is:
55 - 10 = 45 goats

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y.

So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
45 - 20 = 25 goats

Altogether, the number of goats left in the two farms is:
45 (from Farm X) + 25 (from Farm Y) = 70 goats

70 goats"

2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

He spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find out how much he pays on average for each pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the number of pairs:

$2640 / 24 pairs = $110 per pair

So, on average, James pays $110 for each pair of shoes."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food.
2. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount applied.
3. Add the two amounts to get the total cost.

Step 1: Cost of 3 baskets of green food
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- Therefore, 3 baskets of green food cost \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

Step 2: Cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount
- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- With a $2 discount for each basket, the cost per basket of red food is \(18 - 2 = 16\) dollars.
- Therefore, 3 baskets of red food cost \(3 \times 16 = 48\) dollars.

Step 3: Total cost
- The total cost is the sum of the cost of the green food and the red food.
- Total cost = \(75 + 48 = 123\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount you will have to pay is $123."

"Let's define the variables for the ages:
- Let \( B \) be the age of your brother.
- Let \( K \) be your age.
- Let \( S \) be the age of your sister.
- Let \( M \) be the age of your mom.

From the information given, we can write the following equations:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( K = B - 3 \)
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( K = S + 2 \) or \( S = K - 2 \)
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \)
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( K + B + S + M = 87 \)

Now, substitute the expressions for \( K \), \( S \), and \( M \) in terms of \( B \) into the sum equation:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 3 - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]
Simplify the equation:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]
Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]
Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 16 \) back into the equation for \( K \):
\[ K = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

So, you are 13 years old."
"First, we need to calculate the total number of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we multiply 27 by 2:

27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks

Next, we need to determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy. Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and he wants to have some extra glue sticks, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

- Total infected: \(70 + 420 = 490\)

**Day 3:**
- Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections: \(490 \times 6 = 2940\)
- Total infected: \(490 + 2940 = 3430\)

After three days, the total number of people infected is 3430."
"Rafaela received a $20 tip from each of the 40 customers, so the total amount of tips she received is:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \text{ dollars} \]

Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find out how much less, we calculate 10% of $800:

\[ 10\% \times 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Julieta received:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their individual amounts:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of tips received by Julieta and Rafaela altogether is:

1520 dollars"
"Jennifer initially bought 12 oranges.

She gave 2 oranges to each of her three daughters, which totals:
2 oranges/daughter × 3 daughters = 6 oranges

She also gave 3 oranges to her son.

So, the total number of oranges given away is:
6 oranges (to daughters) + 3 oranges (to son) = 9 oranges

Therefore, the number of oranges Jennifer remained with is:
12 oranges (initially bought) - 9 oranges (given away) = 3 oranges

Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"Claire earns 1 badge every month. In a year, which has 12 months, Claire will earn:

\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so in the same 12 months, Amber will earn:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ badges}}{2} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so in 12 months, Wendy will earn:

\[ 12 \text{ badges} \times 3 = 36 \text{ badges} \]

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1 year time frame, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:

\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame."
"Paige bakes from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 banana bread loaves every hour, in 5 hours she bakes:

\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is:

\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. Therefore, the total amount raised from selling all the slices is:

\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times \$0.50/\text{slice} = \$40.00 \]

Paige raised \(\boxed{40}\) dollars."
"If Gretchen has 70 gold coins and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, then she has:

70 - 30 = 40 silver coins.

To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we add the number of gold coins to the number of silver coins:

70 (gold coins) + 40 (silver coins) = 110 coins.

Gretchen had a total of 110 coins."
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students.
2. Add the number of burritos Mr. George ate.
3. Subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students.
- There are 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos.
- Total burritos for students = 50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos.

Step 2: Add the number of burritos Mr. George ate.
- Mr. George ate 20 burritos.

Step 3: Subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered.
- Initial number of burritos = 600.
- Total burritos consumed = 500 (students) + 20 (Mr. George) = 520.
- Leftover burritos = 600 - 520 = 80.

The total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 80."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. There are 12 red cars.
2. There are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so there are \(12 - 2 = 10\) green cars.
3. There are 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so there are \(3 \times 10 = 30\) blue cars.

Now, let's add up the red, green, and blue cars:
\[12 + 10 + 30 = 52\]

The total number of cars in the rink is 75. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:
\[75 - 52 = 23\]

Therefore, the number of yellow cars is 23."
"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as \( F \), Anne has as \( A \), and Sofie has as \( S \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \)
2. \( S = A + 25 \)
3. \( A = F - 12 \)

First, we can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation to find \( F \).

From the third equation, we can express \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ A = F - 12 \]

From the second equation, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( A \):
\[ S = A + 25 \]
Substituting \( A = F - 12 \) into this equation, we get:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \]

Now, we substitute \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \( 28 \) books.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{28} \]"
"Daisy bought a bag of sweet potatoes that weighed 2 times as much as the 5 pounds of potatoes. So, the sweet potatoes weighed:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

The bag of carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the carrots weighed:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots."
"To determine how much Greg will spend on jello, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.
2. Determine how many boxes of jello are required.
3. Calculate the total cost.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.**

Greg wants each of the 30 kids to have 4 jello cups. So, the total number of jello cups needed is:
\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups per kid} = 120 \text{ cups} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many boxes of jello are required.**

Each box makes 10 small jello cups. To find out how many boxes are needed to make 120 cups, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups per box:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost.**

Each box of jello costs $1.25. Therefore, the total cost for 12 boxes is:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

So, Greg will spend \(\boxed{15}\) dollars on jello."
"To find out how much change the seller will give back, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 5 phones.

The cost of one phone is $700, so the total cost for 5 phones is:
\[ 5 \times 700 = 3500 \]

The seller gives $4000. To find the change, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given:
\[ 4000 - 3500 = 500 \]

So, the seller will give back $500 in change."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Madeline pays per month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the $400 monthly cost, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Madeline's monthly payment} = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

This means Keenan pays the remaining 40% of the monthly cost:

\[ \text{Keenan's monthly payment} = 0.40 \times 400 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the question asks for the amount Keenan spends per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide Keenan's monthly payment by 4:

\[ \text{Keenan's weekly payment} = \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Keenan spends $40 per week."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total pieces of pizza**: 60

2. **Pieces eaten on the first day**: \( \frac{2}{5} \) of 60
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24
   \]
   So, Tobias ate 24 pieces on the first day.

3. **Remaining pieces after the first day**: 
   \[
   60 - 24 = 36
   \]

4. **Pieces eaten on the second day**: 10 pieces
   \[
   36 - 10 = 26
   \]
   So, 26 pieces remain after the second day.

5. **Pieces eaten on the third day**: \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining 26 pieces
   \[
   \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14
   \]
   So, Tobias ate 14 pieces on the third day.

6. **Total pieces eaten so far**: 
   \[
   24 + 10 + 14 = 48
   \]

Therefore, Tobias has eaten 48 pieces of pizza so far."
"To find out how much David will spend, we first need to determine the cost per bottle for both soda and water.

1. **Cost per bottle of soda:**
   - 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00.
   - Cost per bottle of soda = $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

2. **Cost per bottle of water:**
   - 4 bottles of water cost $8.00.
   - Cost per bottle of water = $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we calculate the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.

3. **Total cost for 3 bottles of soda:**
   - 3 bottles * $3.00 per bottle = $9.00.

4. **Total cost for 2 bottles of water:**
   - 2 bottles * $2.00 per bottle = $4.00.

5. **Total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:**
   - $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

Therefore, the total cost for David to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $13.00."
"To find out how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 16 bolts.
2. Subtract the total cost from David's initial amount of money.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of 16 bolts.
Each bolt costs $0.03, so the total cost for 16 bolts is:
\[ 16 \times 0.03 = 0.48 \]

Step 2: Subtract the total cost from David's initial amount of money.
David initially has $12.48. After spending $0.48 on the bolts, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts."
"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we first need to determine her hourly rate for dog walking.

Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of work. So, her hourly rate is:
\[ \text{Hourly Rate} = \frac{\$33}{3 \text{ hours}} = \$11 \text{ per hour} \]

Now, to find out how much she would earn after 12 hours, we multiply her hourly rate by 12:
\[ \text{Earnings after 12 hours} = \$11 \times 12 = \$132 \]

Therefore, Ella would earn \(\boxed{132}\) dollars after 12 hours."
"Paul initially has 52 marbles. His friend gave him 28 more marbles, so he then has:

\[52 + 28 = 80\]

Next, Paul lost \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he lost, we calculate \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 80:

\[\frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20\]

So, Paul lost 20 marbles. To find out how many marbles he has left, we subtract the 20 marbles he lost from the 80 marbles he had after receiving more from his friend:

\[80 - 20 = 60\]

Paul has 60 marbles left."

Amy scores a total of 41 points."
"To determine how much Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the profit to find the cost price of the chickens.

First, calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell:
\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \]

Next, calculate the total revenue from selling these chickens:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, so the total cost of the chickens he sold is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Profit} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for:
\[ \boxed{7000} \]"
"Julie sold 14 glasses of lemonade. The total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32. Since the boys (Micah and Mitchell) sold an equal number of glasses, we can find out how many glasses Micah sold by first determining how many glasses the boys sold in total.

The total number of glasses sold by Julie and the boys is 32. Subtracting the 14 glasses sold by Julie, we get:
32 - 14 = 18 glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell together.

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses by 2 to find out how many glasses each of them sold:
18 / 2 = 9 glasses sold by Micah.

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold:
14 - 9 = 5.

Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

Therefore, Iris spent a total of $575 at the spa."
"First, let's calculate how much money Sarah will earn from selling the rope:

The rope is 20 meters long, and she sells it for $2 per meter. So, the total amount of money she will earn is:
\[ 20 \, \text{meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40 \]

Next, let's determine the cost of the new rope she plans to buy. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and she needs 20 meters of it. So, the total cost of the new rope is:
\[ 20 \, \text{meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$30 \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the money Sarah earned to find out how much money she will have left over:

So, the amount of money Sarah will have left over after she buys the new rope is:
\[ \$10 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age. If in 10 years she will be 18 years old, then her current age is:

\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Three times her current age is:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Let's denote the number of years from now when her age will be 24 as \( x \). Therefore, in \( x \) years, her age will be:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item category:

1. **Bacon**: Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total. So, the cost per pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2.

2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. So, the cost per packet of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4. Since she has 6 packets, the total cost for chicken is $4 * 6 = $24.

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4. With 3 packs, the total cost for strawberries is $4 * 3 = $12.

4. **Apples**: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. So, the cost per pack of apples is $4 / 2 = $2. With 7 packs, the total cost for apples is $2 * 7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
- Bacon: $10
- Chicken: $24
- Strawberries: $12
- Apples: $14

Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left in her budget, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
$65 - $60 = $5

So, Kelly has $5 left in her budget."
"Let's denote the usual length of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, plus a 15-minute encore, and the total runtime is 65 minutes. We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes.

Argo now has 50 toys."
"On Tuesdays, the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesdays, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Fridays, they make twice as many as on a Tuesday, which is 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

To find the total number of chimichangas made on these three days, we add the number of chimichangas made each day:

125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday) = 500 chimichangas.

The final numerical answer is:
500"
"First, we need to determine how many microphones will not find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. Given that 20% of the 50 microphones won't fit, we calculate:

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 microphones

This means 10 microphones will not be paired. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be paired is:

50 - 10 = 40 microphones

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:

40 / 2 = 20 pairs

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage."
"Jerry counts six birds nesting in the bushes. 

2/3 of that number of birds flying overhead is:

Adding all these together, the total number of birds Jerry counts is:
\[ 6 + 4 + 24 = 34 \]

Total number of birds Jerry counts: 34"
"Lani started with 55 cookies and ate 5, so she had:

\[ 55 - 5 = 50 \]

Now, she placed the remaining 50 cookies equally into 5 jars. To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we divide 50 by 5:

\[ 50 \div 5 = 10 \]

So, there were 10 cookies in each jar."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals for the orchids and the daisies.

For the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the orchids is \(5 \times 5 = 25\).

For the daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the daisies is \(4 \times 10 = 40\).

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of orchid petals from the total number of daisy petals:
- The difference in the number of petals is \(40 - 25 = 15\).

So, the daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids."
"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants:

\[ \text{Outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. To find the number of flowering plants, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, 25% of the plants are flowering plants."
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first determine the speed of the thingamabob and then use that to find the speed of the whirligig.

Given:
- A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.
- A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob.

From this, we can find the speed of the thingamabob:
\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ m/s}}{11} = 11 \text{ m/s} \]

Now, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob:
\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ m/s} = 55 \text{ m/s} \]

Therefore, the whirligig spins at 55 meters per second."
"Let's break down the costs:

1. The salad costs $6.
2. The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, so it costs $6 / 2 = $3.
3. The total cost for the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.
4. Ellen pays $11 in total for her goods, so the cost for the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.
5. Ellen eats 2 carrots a day, so the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

Therefore, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day."
"First, let's calculate Mark's new hourly wage after the raise. He used to make $10 an hour and received a raise of $2 per hour, so his new hourly wage is:

\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours he works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is:

\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week:

\[ 12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mark makes \(\boxed{480}\) dollars a week."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
2. Then, the number of times Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn is \( 3J \).
3. Let \( A \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Alba's lawn.
4. Then, the number of times Tasha mowed Alba's lawn is \( 5J \).

We know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for each mowing. Therefore, the total amount Tasha made from mowing Joe's lawn is \( 6J \), and the total amount she made from mowing Kamala's lawn is \( 6 \times 3J = 18J \). For Alba's lawn, she made \( 6 \times 5J = 30J \).

The total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is the sum of the amounts from Joe's, Kamala's, and Alba's lawns:
\[ 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J \]

We also know that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Therefore, the amount she made from lemonade sales is:
\[ 80 - 54J \]

To find \( J \), we need to determine the total number of lawns mowed. The total number of lawns mowed is:
\[ J + 3J + 5J = 9J \]

Since the total earnings from mowing lawns is \( 54J \), and we know the total earnings from all activities is $80, we can set up the equation:
\[ 54J = 80 - \text{(lemonade sales)} \]

However, we need to find \( J \) first. Since the total earnings from mowing lawns is $54J and the total earnings is $80, we can solve for \( J \) by assuming the simplest scenario where the earnings from mowing lawns are maximized and the rest comes from lemonade sales. Given the problem constraints, we can directly calculate the lemonade sales as:
\[ \text{Lemonade sales} = 80 - 54J \]

Since \( 54J \) must be a multiple of 6 and less than 80, the only feasible value for \( J \) that fits is 1 (as higher values would exceed $80 for mowing lawns alone).

So, if \( J = 1 \):
\[ 54J = 54 \times 1 = 54 \]
\[ \text{Lemonade sales} = 80 - 54 = 26 \]

Therefore, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's find Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

Martin's weight = 55 kg
Carl's weight = Martin's weight + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 55 kg + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 71 kg

Next, we calculate Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:

Christian's weight = Carl's weight + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 71 kg + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 79 kg

Finally, we find Harry's weight. Harry is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:

Harry's weight = Christian's weight - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 79 kg - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 74 kg

The weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"To calculate John's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total hours John rents his car out each month.
2. Calculate his total earnings from renting the car.
3. Subtract his car payment from his total earnings to find his profit.

Step 1: Total hours rented per month
John rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time.
Total hours = 10 times * 3 hours/time = 30 hours

Step 2: Total earnings
He gets paid $25 an hour.
Total earnings = 30 hours * $25/hour = $750

Step 3: Calculate profit
Car payment = $500
Profit = Total earnings - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500 = $250

Therefore, John makes a profit of $250 on his car."
"First, let's determine how many notebooks Martha originally had. Since Martha ended up with 7 notebooks after buying 5 more, she originally had:

\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

Now, since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally, Joseph had:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

"Dijana rowed for 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, which means Anis rowed an additional \(50 \times \frac{1}{5} = 10\) miles. Therefore, Anis rowed \(50 + 10 = 60\) miles.

The total distance both of them rowed is the sum of the distances each rowed, which is \(50 + 60 = 110\) miles.

Total distance rowed: 110 miles."
"Susan originally made 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies for himself, leaving 96 cookies to be divided among her 6 nephews.

To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews:

96 cookies ÷ 6 nephews = 16 cookies per nephew

Each of Susan’s nephews will get 16 cookies."
"Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages.

Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.

So, the total number of pages Denise read is \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.

Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and 0 pages today, so he read a total of \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages Daniel read from the total pages Denise read: \(28 - 13 = 15\).

Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the total amount of soup Calvin has in terms of bowls.

Calvin's pot can fill:
- 4 adult bowls
- 8 child bowls

Since Calvin and his wife are both adults, they will each have 1 adult bowl, which totals 2 adult bowls for the adults. This leaves us with 2 adult bowls worth of soup for the children (since 4 total adult bowls - 2 adult bowls for Calvin and his wife = 2 adult bowls for the children).

Each adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls (since 4 adult bowls = 8 child bowls, so 1 adult bowl = 2 child bowls).

Therefore, the 2 adult bowls for the children are equivalent to:
2 adult bowls * 2 child bowls/adult bowl = 4 child bowls

Calvin has 4 child bowls of soup left after the adults have eaten. There are 2 children, so we divide the remaining soup equally between them:
4 child bowls / 2 children = 2 child bowls per child

Each child will be able to have 2 bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

Each child will be able to have 2 bowls of soup for lunch."
"William bought five notebooks at $1.50 each and one ballpen at $0.50.

The cost for the notebooks is:
5 notebooks * $1.50/notebook = $7.50

The cost for the ballpen is:
1 ballpen * $0.50/ballpen = $0.50

The total amount William spent is:
$7.50 + $0.50 = $8.00

He spent a total of $8.00."
"To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can calculate the material required for each type of mask separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 small mask, she needs \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards of material.
- For 20 small masks, she would need \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards of material.

Next, let's calculate the material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 large mask, she needs \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards of material.
- For 8 large masks, she would need \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards of material.

Now, we add the material needed for the small and large masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

Therefore, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tickets Deepa bought.
2. Divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets to find the average price per ticket.

First, let's calculate the total number of tickets Deepa bought. Since there are 9 Fast and the Furious movies and she has seen each one 3 times, the total number of tickets is:

\[ 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ tickets} \]

Next, we know that she spent $216 in total. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

\[ \frac{216 \text{ dollars}}{27 \text{ tickets}} = 8 \text{ dollars per ticket} \]

So, the average price she paid per ticket is $8."
"To find out how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his activities and subtract that from the total hours in a day.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up the time spent on these activities:
\[10 \text{ (sleep)} + 8 \text{ (work)} + 1 \text{ (walk)} = 19 \text{ hours}\]

There are 24 hours in a day. So, the free time Harold has left is:
\[24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours}\]

Therefore, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day."
"Tim starts with 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes.

He uses 3 blue shoe boxes for fishing, so the number of blue shoe boxes left is:
7 - 3 = 4 blue shoe boxes.

He uses 1/3 of his red shoe boxes for fishing, so the number of red shoe boxes used is:
1/3 * 9 = 3 red shoe boxes.

Therefore, the number of red shoe boxes left is:
9 - 3 = 6 red shoe boxes.

So, the total number of shoe boxes left in Tim's box is:
4 blue shoe boxes + 6 red shoe boxes = 10 shoe boxes.

Final numerical answer:
10 shoe boxes."
"Sarah has 9 books. Joseph had twice the number of Sarah’s books, so Joseph originally had \(9 \times 2 = 18\) books. Joseph lost 2 of them, so he currently has \(18 - 2 = 16\) books.

"Dean starts with 30 marbles.

First, he gives 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6 \]

So, he gives 6 marbles to Jamie.

Next, he gives 10 marbles to Donald.

Now, we calculate how many marbles Dean has left:
\[ 30 - 6 - 10 = 14 \]

Dean is left with 14 marbles."
"To solve this problem, let's first set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( D \) be Duncan's current age and \( A \) be Adam's current age.

From the problem, we know:
- Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).
- Duncan's age eight years ago was \( D - 8 \).
- Adam's age four years ago was \( A - 4 \).
- Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, so we can write the equation: \( D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \).

Now, substitute \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam is currently 30 years old. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years."

Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is \(2 \times 200 = 400\) acres.

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm, so it is \(400 + 100 = 500\) acres.

Together, the two farms have \(200 + 500 = 700\) acres.

700 acres"
"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, we calculate:

50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. We multiply the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours in a workday:

40 packages/hour * 8 hours = 320 packages

Now, we calculate how much money he earns. He gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes. So, we multiply the number of packages by the payment per package:

320 packages * $0.20/package = $64.00

Therefore, Colby earns $64.00 in a typical eight-hour workday."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle:**
   - A normal sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes.
   - An extreme sudoku puzzle takes 4 times that long, so:
     \[
     45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Calculate how many bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes:**
   - John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, which is 30 minutes.
   - To find out how many 30-minute intervals are in 180 minutes, we divide 180 by 30:
     \[
     \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes per bottle}} = 6 \text{ bottles}
     \]

Therefore, John drinks 6 bottles of water in the time it takes him to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( R \) as the number of red balloons.
- \( Y \) as the number of yellow balloons.

From the problem, we know:
- Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
- Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
- There are 20 red balloons.

First, we can calculate the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons:
\[ 2 \times R = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

This means the remaining bologna pieces were thrown at the yellow balloons:
\[ 58 - 40 = 18 \]

Since each yellow balloon received 3 pieces of bologna, we can find the number of yellow balloons by dividing the remaining bologna pieces by 3:
\[ Y = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is 6.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, which totals:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the interval for a tune-up:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time."
"On Tuesday, Bruce works for 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which is \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

To find the total number of hours Bruce works over these three days, we add the hours from each day together:

\(5 + 10 + 8 = 23\)

Bruce works a total of 23 hours in all these three days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: Since 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons would be:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each would cost:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to cover these expenses, the total amount they had together is $28. Since they had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total by 2 to find out how much each girl received:
\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14."

"To calculate the profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Step 1: Total number of lollipops sold
- Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops.
- Total lollipops sold = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops.

Step 2: Total revenue from selling the lollipops
- Each lollipop was sold for $0.8.
- Total revenue = 300 lollipops * $0.8/lollipop = $240.

"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to calculate the number of trips the sloth can make in that time and then divide the total number of berries by the number of trips.

1. First, we calculate the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours. Since each trip takes 4 hours, the number of trips in 8 hours is:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many berries the sloth needs to pick per trip to collect 24 berries in total. We divide the total number of berries by the number of trips:
   \[
   \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground to collect 24 berries in 8 hours is 12 berries per trip."
"First, we need to determine how much water is in the tank after Anthony and his father fill it. The tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water. Therefore, the tank is filled with:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water is left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. Over 6 days, the total amount of water emptied from the tank is:

\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Subtracting the amount of water emptied from the initial amount in the tank gives us the remaining amount of water in the tank:

\[ 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, after 6 days, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank is:

"To find the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the calories in one mini cinnamon roll.
2. Calculate the total calories for all mini cinnamon rolls.
3. Calculate the calories in one mini blueberry muffin.
4. Calculate the total calories for all mini blueberry muffins.
5. Add the total calories from both types of pastries to get the final answer.

Step 1: A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. Since a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, the calories in one mini cinnamon roll are:
\[ 600 \times \frac{1}{3} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Step 2: Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories for the mini cinnamon rolls are:
\[ 200 \times 200 = 40,000 \text{ calories} \]

Step 3: A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. Since a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, the calories in one mini blueberry muffin are:
\[ 450 \times \frac{1}{3} = 150 \text{ calories} \]

Step 4: Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories for the mini blueberry muffins are:
\[ 300 \times 150 = 45,000 \text{ calories} \]

Step 5: Adding the total calories from both types of pastries gives:
\[ 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 \text{ calories} \]

Therefore, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is:
\[ 85,000 \]"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

1. On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
2. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, so that's \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs each day.
3. On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
4. On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's sum up the total number of Junebugs removed:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Adding these together:

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we need to find the average number of Junebugs removed per day. There are 5 days in the week (Monday through Friday), so we divide the total by 5:

\[
\frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

For the bus:
- Speed = 60 miles per hour
- Time = 5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

For the car:
- Speed = 30 miles per hour
- Time = 8 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, to find out how much farther the bus went than the car:
- Difference in distance = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."

Next, we subtract this sum from the total number of toys to find out how many bouncy balls there are:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

So, the tube of bouncy balls contains 14 bouncy balls."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( P + Pa + J = 100 \)
2. \( Pa = J + 10 \)
3. \( P = Pa + J \)

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we have \( J \), we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is \( 50 \) years.

Final numerical answer:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Maria invited 4 friends, and she gave each of them 2 water balloons. So, the total number of balloons given to her friends initially is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) balloons.

2. Maria also had 1 water balloon for herself.

3. Then, Maria's mom came out and gave each person (including Maria) 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons given is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) balloons.

4. Adding the initial balloons to the additional balloons, the total number of balloons is \(8 + 1 + 15 = 24\).

So, the total number of balloons the girls had is 24."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated and already owned by the charity group.

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so the total number of donated boxes is:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

Adding the 10 boxes they already have:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Each table can fit 2 boxes, so the total number of tables needed to fit all the boxes is:
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

Since they already own 15 tables, the number of new tables they need is:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ tables} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"To find the average total distance spat, we first need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then find the average of these distances.

For Zoey:
- Number of seeds: 40
- Distance per seed: 10 feet
- Total distance spat by Zoey: \(40 \times 10 = 400\) feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds: 35
- Distance per seed: 12 feet
- Total distance spat by Sydney: \(35 \times 12 = 420\) feet

Now, we find the average total distance spat by both:
- Total distance spat by both: \(400 + 420 = 820\) feet
- Number of people: 2

Average total distance spat: \(\frac{820}{2} = 410\) feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of widgets produced by each machine in a month.
2. Calculate the revenue from selling the widgets produced by each machine.
3. Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of widgets produced by each machine in a month.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 60
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days in a month: 30
  - Total widgets in a month = 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 45
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days in a month: 30
  - Total widgets in a month = 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

**Step 2: Calculate the revenue from selling the widgets produced by each machine.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Total revenue = 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Total revenue = 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

**Step 3: Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.**

- Difference in revenue = Revenue from Widgeteer 3000 - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000
- Difference in revenue = $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

Therefore, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. This means he will stay for a total of 17 hours.

The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos. For the additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5), he will pay 70 pesos per hour.

The cost for the additional 5 hours is:
5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

So, the total cost for Cameron is:
1000 pesos (for the first 12 hours) + 350 pesos (for the additional 5 hours) = 1350 pesos

If Cameron had paid for a 24-hour stay, it would have cost 1600 pesos.

The amount Cameron would save by paying for the additional hours instead of a full 24-hour stay is:
1600 pesos (24-hour stay) - 1350 pesos (12-hour stay + additional hours) = 250 pesos

Cameron would save 250 pesos."
"First, let's determine how much hay each sheep needs. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, twice that amount is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pounds. Therefore, each sheep needs \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds of hay.

Next, we calculate the total hay needed for the goats. With 15 goats, the total hay needed is \(15 \times 5 = 75\) pounds.

Then, we calculate the total hay needed for the sheep. With 12 sheep, the total hay needed is \(12 \times 7 = 84\) pounds.

Finally, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total hay needed. The total is \(75 + 84 = 159\) pounds.

Therefore, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay."
"First, let's calculate how much John earned in the week. He earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:

\[ 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we need to account for his expenses. He spends $50 on gas, so his remaining money is:

\[ 300 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 250 \, \text{dollars} \]

John also wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so after the deposit, he will have:

\[ 250 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, he buys 5 pencils that cost $10 each, so the total cost for the pencils is:

\[ 5 \, \text{pencils} \times 10 \, \text{dollars/pencil} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from his remaining money, he has:

\[ 150 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many $25 pens he can buy with the remaining $100. The number of pens he can buy is:

\[ \frac{100 \, \text{dollars}}{25 \, \text{dollars/pen}} = 4 \, \text{pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled out. Craig has spelled out 20 words, each with 15 letters. So, the total number of letters Craig has spelled is:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled is:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the number of letters Craig and his brother have spelled:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

So, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

\[ 650 \]"
"To find the total number of children in the drill, we need to calculate the number of children in one row and then multiply that by the total number of rows.

Each row has 8 children, and there are 7 rows per school. Since there are 5 different schools, the total number of rows is \(7 \times 5 = 35\).

Now, we multiply the number of children per row by the total number of rows:

\(8 \times 35 = 280\)

So, the total number of children in the drill is 280."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming all her coupons. Since each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice and she has 9 coupons, the total number of bottles is:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself."
"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing job, we need to consider the following components:

1. The visit charge: $40
2. The labor charge: $35 per hour for 2.25 hours. Since the charge is per hour or part thereof, we round up 2.25 hours to 3 hours (as partial hours are charged as full hours). So, the labor charge is $35 * 3 = $105.
3. The parts charge: $60

Now, we add these charges together:

$40 (visit charge) + $105 (labor charge) + $60 (parts charge) = $205

Therefore, Patty charged $205 for the job."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount:

\[ \text{Total cost before discount} = 10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15/\text{CD} = \$150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount:

\[ \text{Discount} = 40\% \times \$150 = 0.40 \times \$150 = \$60 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:

\[ \text{Total cost after discount} = \$150 - \$60 = \$90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each:

\[ \text{Total money from selling 5 CDs} = 5 \times \$40 = \$200 \]

Now, we need to determine how much money James was out after selling the CDs. We subtract the money he got from selling the CDs from the total cost after the discount:

\[ \text{Money out} = \$90 - \$200 = -\$110 \]

Since the result is negative, it means James actually gained money from this transaction. However, the question asks how much money he was ""out,"" which implies a loss. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that he was not out any money, but rather gained $110.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"To calculate how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to multiply the quantity of each type of root crop by its respective price and then sum up the totals.

1. For yams: \(6 \text{ yams} \times \$1.5 \text{ per yam} = \$9\)
2. For sweet potatoes: \(10 \text{ sweet potatoes} \times \$2 \text{ per sweet potato} = \$20\)
3. For carrots: \(4 \text{ carrots} \times \$1.25 \text{ per carrot} = \$5\)

Now, we add up the totals from each type of root crop:

\(\$9 + \$20 + \$5 = \$34\)

Therefore, if Jen sells everything, she will earn \(\$34\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. Calculate the distance James swims initially.
2. Determine the time it takes to swim that distance.
3. Calculate the rest time.
4. Determine the remaining distance.
5. Calculate the time to swim the remaining distance at the reduced speed.
6. Sum up all the times to get the total time.

Let's go through each step:

1. **Distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Time to swim the initial distance:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Rest time:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Remaining distance:**
   The remaining distance is the total distance minus the distance already swum.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Time to swim the remaining distance at the reduced speed:**
   James swims the remaining distance at half the original speed, which is 1 mile per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Total time:**
   Sum up all the times.
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours."

"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the commission from the New York Times.
2. Calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal.
3. Add the two amounts to get the total commission.

**Step 1: Commission from the New York Times**
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy of the New York Times.
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- He sells 6 copies.

The commission per copy of the New York Times is:
\[ 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \]

The total commission from 6 copies is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]

**Step 2: Commission from the Wall Street Journal**
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy of the Wall Street Journal.
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- He sells 10 copies.

The commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \]

The total commission from 10 copies is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \]

**Step 3: Total Commission**
- Add the commission from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.

The total commission is:

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \) (total points scored by the team)
2. \( B = A + 20 \) (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)
3. \( B = D + 10 \) (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)

We can substitute the expressions for \( B \) from the second and third equations into the first equation. First, let's express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \)
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \)

Now, substitute these into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3B = 75 \]
\[ B = 25 \]

Now that we have \( B = 25 \), we can find \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."

Given:
- The book is 1.5 inches thick.
- There are 100 pages per inch of paper.

To find the total number of pages in the book, we multiply the thickness of the book by the number of pages per inch:

\[ \text{Total pages} = 1.5 \, \text{inches} \times 100 \, \text{pages/inch} \]

\[ \text{Total pages} = 150 \, \text{pages} \]

So, the book has 150 pages."
"First, let's calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we need to convert this time into minutes because Vince's stapling rate is given in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals there are in 900 minutes, we divide:

900 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:

60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Usual Sleep Duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - The total sleep duration is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours.
   - Converting 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Sleepwalking Duration:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is \(2:38 - 2:15 = 23\) minutes.

3. **Usual Wake-Up Time:**
   - Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - On this particular day, she woke up 5 minutes earlier, so her wake-up time was 5:55 a.m.

4. **Total Time Kim Was Asleep:**
   - From 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 7 hours and 55 minutes.
   - Converting 7 hours and 55 minutes to minutes: \(7 \times 60 + 55 = 475\) minutes.

5. **Sleep Time on Bed:**
   - Subtract the sleepwalking time from the total time Kim was asleep.
   - \(475 - 23 = 452\) minutes.

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring cups Jonathan has. Since he has two dozen cups, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Next, we know that Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, we add the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has:

\[ 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \text{ utensils} \]

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ 34 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Occupancy:**
   - The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds.
   - Initially, 1/5 of the beds are occupied.
   - Number of occupied beds initially = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.
   - Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds initially = \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) beds.

2. **Daily Admissions:**
   - 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of admissions = \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Initially, 200 beds are occupied.
   - After 2 weeks, an additional 700 patients are admitted.
   - Total occupied beds after 2 weeks = \( 200 + 700 = 900 \) beds.

4. **Total Unoccupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - The hospital's total capacity is 1000 beds.
   - Total unoccupied beds after 2 weeks = \( 1000 - 900 = 100 \) beds.

"If Courtney overstated the number of people by 20%, we can set up the following relationship:

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people who attended the concert.

According to Courtney, the number of people was 48, which is 120% (or 1 + 20%) of the actual number of people. So we can write the equation:

\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]

\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"To solve this problem, let's define the number of balls each boy carried in terms of Jeffrey's number of balls.

Let \( J \) represent the number of balls Jeffrey carried. According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by all three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each boy:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

Now, we can find the total number of balls:
\[ 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes by the end of the third day after filling in two holes.
3. Use the information that the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

Let's start with the first step:

- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes.

So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29 \]

By the end of the third day, they had 29 holes. According to the problem, by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes was four times the number of holes at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day was 10. Therefore, by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes was:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Since they had 29 holes at the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \]

So, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips.
2. Let's denote the number of corn chips Collins got as \( C \).
3. According to the problem, Collins got 15 more corn chips than Amora or Lainey, so \( C = 70 + 15 = 85 \).

Now, we can calculate the total number of corn chips:

- Amora's corn chips: 70
- Lainey's corn chips: 70
- Collins's corn chips: 85

Total corn chips = 70 + 70 + 85 = 225

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is 225."
"To find out how much Jen's travel costs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the tickets, which is 50% more than the supplies.
2. Add the cost of the supplies to the cost of the tickets to get the total travel cost.

First, let's calculate the cost of the tickets. The supplies cost $400, and the tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. So, we calculate 50% of $400:

\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the tickets cost $200 more than the supplies. Therefore, the total cost of the tickets is:

\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Now, we add the cost of the supplies to the cost of the tickets to get the total travel cost:

\[ 400 + 600 = 1000 \]

So, the total travel cost is $1000."
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( X + S + A = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, we can substitute the second equation into the first to express everything in terms of \( A \):
\[ (S + 5) + S + A = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A = 334 \]

Next, we substitute the third equation into the above equation:
\[ 2(4A - 13) + A = 334 \]
\[ 8A - 26 + A = 334 \]
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we have \( A \), we can find \( S \):
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

Final answer: Stan has caught 147 Pokemon."
"Each episode is 20 minutes long. There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, so there are 20 / 2 = 10 episodes in total.

If John watches every episode, the total time he will spend watching the show is 10 episodes * 20 minutes/episode = 200 minutes.

200 minutes"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird flew in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction.

1. The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 10 \, \text{hours} \times 30 \, \text{miles/hour} = 300 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. The bird then flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 2 \, \text{hours} \times 18 \, \text{miles/hour} = 36 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 5 \, \text{hours} \times 22 \, \text{miles/hour} = 110 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Now, we sum the distances flown in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction:
\[
\text{Total distance south} = 300 \, \text{miles} + 110 \, \text{miles} = 410 \, \text{miles}
\]
\[
\text{Total distance north} = 36 \, \text{miles}
\]
\[
\text{Net distance south} = 410 \, \text{miles} - 36 \, \text{miles} = 374 \, \text{miles}
\]

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[
\boxed{374 \, \text{miles}}

"To find out how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Greta initially made 1 dozen (12) cream cheese swirl brownies.
2. At her office party, she received an additional 1/2 dozen (6) brownies.
3. When she arrived home, she had 4 dozen (48) brownies from her friends.
4. During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten.

Now, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had before the surprise party:
\[ 12 \text{ (initial batch)} + 6 \text{ (from office party)} + 48 \text{ (from friends)} = 66 \text{ brownies} \]

Next, we subtract the number of brownies eaten during the surprise party:
\[ 66 \text{ (total brownies)} - 18 \text{ (eaten)} = 48 \text{ brownies} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 48 \text{ brownies} \]"
"Nani is 8 years old.

His brother is twice Nani's age, so the brother is \(8 \times 2 = 16\) years old.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find 25% of Nani's age, we calculate \(8 \times 0.25 = 2\). So, the sister is \(8 - 2 = 6\) years old.

The total age of all three family members is \(8 + 16 + 6 = 30\).

"To find out how long it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the total time for each type of string and then sum them up.

1. For the 3 racquets strung with synthetic gut:
   - Time per racquet: 15 minutes
   - Total time: 3 * 15 = 45 minutes

2. For the 5 racquets strung with polyester string:
   - Time per racquet: 22 minutes
   - Total time: 5 * 22 = 110 minutes

3. For the 4 racquets strung with a hybrid set:
   - Time per racquet: 18 minutes
   - Total time: 4 * 18 = 72 minutes

Now, we add up the total time for all racquets:
- Total time: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes

Therefore, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all of the racquets."
"John is buying phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which makes a total of 4 phones.

The first 2 phones are at full price, which is $600 each. So, the cost for the first 2 phones is:
2 phones * $600/phone = $1200

The remaining 2 phones are at half price, which is $600 / 2 = $300 each. So, the cost for the remaining 2 phones is:
2 phones * $300/phone = $600

Adding the cost of the first 2 phones and the remaining 2 phones together gives the total cost:
$1200 + $600 = $1800

Therefore, John paid a total of $1800 for all the phones."
"To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. 

Given that Carlton's team has 13 players and Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = \text{Number of players on Carlton's team} + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 13 + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 20 \]

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

\[ \text{Total number of players} = \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} + \text{Number of players on Carlton's team} \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 20 + 13 \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is 33."
"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of slats} = 100 \]

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington gave away. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes.

Next, we subtract the boxes given away from the total number of boxes she bought:
12 boxes - 4 boxes = 8 boxes

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining boxes. To find out how many boxes she kept, we calculate:
8 boxes * 1/4 = 2 boxes

This means she sold the rest of the boxes, which is:
8 boxes - 2 boxes = 6 boxes

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is:
6 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 120 oranges

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges."
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, the number of states in India can be expressed as \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India, which is \( x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \).

Simplifying the expression, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \).

Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is 79."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy:

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Tyler has already saved $14, so we need to find out how much more money he needs:

Amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour, so to find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide the amount needed by his hourly wage:

Hours needed = Amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5

Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Robert has 30 cherries.
2. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, so Richard has \(30 - 10 = 20\) cherries.
3. The total number of cherries is 60. If we add up the cherries that Robert and Richard have, we get \(30 + 20 = 50\) cherries.
4. This means Jerry has \(60 - 50 = 10\) cherries.
5. Now, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has: \(30 - 10 = 20\).

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

Final numerical answer:
20"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of boxes sold on each day:**

   - **Saturday:**
     - Gingerbread: 10 boxes
     - Apple pie: 4 fewer boxes than on Sunday, so we need to find out how many boxes were sold on Sunday first.

   - **Sunday:**
     - Gingerbread: 5 more boxes than on Saturday, so \(10 + 5 = 15\) boxes
     - Apple pie: 15 boxes

   - **Saturday (revisited):**
     - Apple pie: Since Sunday's sales were 15 boxes of apple pie and it was 4 more than Saturday, then on Saturday, he sold \(15 - 4 = 11\) boxes of apple pie.

2. **Calculate the total earnings for each day:**

   - **Saturday:**
     - Gingerbread: \(10 \text{ boxes} \times \$6 = \$60\)
     - Apple pie: \(11 \text{ boxes} \times \$15 = \$165\)
     - Total for Saturday: \(\$60 + \$165 = \$225\)

   - **Sunday:**
     - Gingerbread: \(15 \text{ boxes} \times \$6 = \$90\)
     - Apple pie: \(15 \text{ boxes} \times \$15 = \$225\)
     - Total for Sunday: \(\$90 + \$225 = \$315\)

3. **Calculate the total earnings for both days:**

   - Total earnings: \(\$225 + \$315 = \$540\)

Therefore, Sunny earned a total of \$540 for the two days."
"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of sunscreen Pamela will use during her vacation.
2. Determine how many bottles are required based on the total usage.

First, let's calculate the total amount of sunscreen used:
- Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour.
- She will be outside for 4 hours a day.
- The vacation lasts for 8 days.

So, the total amount of sunscreen used is:
\[ 1 \, \text{ounce/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours/day} \times 8 \, \text{days} = 32 \, \text{ounces} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 8-ounce bottles are required to provide 32 ounces of sunscreen:
\[ \frac{32 \, \text{ounces}}{8 \, \text{ounces/bottle}} = 4 \, \text{bottles} \]

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. Given that the blue car costs $100, we can calculate the price of the red car as follows:

1. Calculate 40% of $100:
\[ 40\% \times 100 = 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \]

2. Subtract this amount from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

So, the red car costs $60.

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the blue car and the red car together:
\[ 100 + 60 = 160 \]

Both cars cost a total of $160."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Current Age of Emil**: Emil is currently 19 years old.

2. **Age of Emil in 5 Years**: In 5 years, Emil will be 19 + 5 = 24 years old.

3. **Age of Emil's Dad in 5 Years**: When Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad. So, if we let the dad's age in 5 years be \(D\), then:
   \[
   24 = \frac{1}{2}D \implies D = 24 \times 2 = 48
   \]
   So, Emil's dad will be 48 years old in 5 years.

4. **Current Age of Emil's Dad**: Since Emil's dad will be 48 in 5 years, his current age is:
   \[
   48 - 5 = 43
   \]

5. **Age of Emil's Brother in 5 Years**: When Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. If we let the brother's age in 5 years be \(B\), then:
   \[
   24 = 2B \implies B = \frac{24}{2} = 12
   \]
   So, Emil's brother will be 12 years old in 5 years.

6. **Current Age of Emil's Brother**: Since Emil's brother will be 12 in 5 years, his current age is:
   \[
   12 - 5 = 7
   \]

7. **Sum of the Ages of Emil's Dad and Brother Now**: The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother is:
   \[
   43 + 7 = 50
   \]

**Final Answer**: The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 50."
"Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.

Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, which means her sister gave her \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.

Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which means her friend gave her \(20 \times 2 = 40\) beads.

To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we add the beads from her mother, sister, and friend:

\[20 + 30 + 40 = 90\]

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount of Thursday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) pounds.

The total amount of crawfish caught over the three days is \(3 + 12 + 6 = 21\) pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, the number of servings Joe has is \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) servings.

Therefore, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish."
"First, let's calculate the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Since 20% of the class are football players, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of football players} = 20\% \times 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after accounting for the football players:

\[ \text{Remaining students} = 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We can calculate this as:

\[ \text{Number of cheerleaders or band members} = 25\% \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

Now, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members to find out how many students are leaving early:

\[ \text{Total students leaving early} = 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is:

12"
"First, we determine the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's and Sophie wears size five boots, we calculate Charlie's boot size as follows:

\[ \text{Charlie's boot size} = 5 \times \text{Sophie's boot size} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Next, we find the average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie. The average is calculated by adding the sizes together and then dividing by the number of people:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Charlie's boot size} + \text{Sophie's boot size}}{2} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

The average size of shoe worn by the two is 15."
"To determine how many additional flowers Pat needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them. Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Therefore, the total space required for each plant is:

\[1 \text{ foot (plant)} + 1.5 \text{ feet (space)} = 2.5 \text{ feet}\]

Next, we need to find out how many plants can fit in the 111 feet long flower bed. We do this by dividing the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each plant:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means Pat can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional flowers she needs to buy is:

\[44 - 17 = 27\]

Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:

\[27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, Pat will spend \(\boxed{162}\) dollars at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Brother's daily consumption} = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9 \text{ pretzels} \]

To find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week, we multiply his daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ \text{Brother's weekly consumption} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ pretzels} \]

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"To determine how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost for each type of plant and then sum these costs.

First, let's calculate the cost for the petunias:
- Each basket needs 3 petunias.
- There are 5 baskets.
- Each petunia costs $3.00.

The total number of petunias needed is:
\[ 3 \text{ petunias/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 15 \text{ petunias} \]

The total cost for the petunias is:
\[ 15 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00/\text{petunia} = \$45.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the sweet potato vines:
- Each basket needs 2 sweet potato vines.
- There are 5 baskets.
- Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.

The total number of sweet potato vines needed is:
\[ 2 \text{ vines/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 10 \text{ vines} \]

The total cost for the sweet potato vines is:
\[ 10 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50/\text{vine} = \$25.00 \]

Now, we sum the costs for the petunias and the sweet potato vines to find the total cost:
\[ \$45.00 + \$25.00 = \$70.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers, so the total soil used for sunflowers is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations, so the total soil used for carnations is \(10 \times 1.5 = 15\) pounds.

Adding these together, the total soil used for sunflowers and carnations is \(12 + 15 = 27\) pounds.

The total soil they have is 30 pounds. Subtracting the soil used for sunflowers and carnations, the remaining soil is \(30 - 27 = 3\) pounds.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, with 3 pounds of soil remaining, they can plant \(3\) roses.

Final numerical answer:
3"
"First, let's calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times \$2,000.00 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with the $500.00 she sets aside each month. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

\[ \text{Number of shoes per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \]

Since she can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0.5 pairs per month, which means she can buy 1 pair every 2 months.

Now, let's calculate how many pairs she can buy in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

\[ \text{Number of pairs per year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months per pair}} = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time it takes for Emily to both peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp:
- Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
- To peel 90 shrimp, it will take \( \frac{90}{6} = 15 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to sauté 90 shrimp:
- Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- To sauté 90 shrimp, it will take \( \frac{90}{30} \times 10 = 3 \times 10 = 30 \) minutes.

Since peeling and sautéing are sequential tasks, we add the time for both tasks:
- Total time = Time to peel + Time to sauté = 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

45 minutes"
"Let's break down the cooling and warming process step by step:

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - Cooling rate: 2 degrees per hour
   - Total cooling: \(2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 6 \, \text{degrees}\)

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - Cooling rate: 3 degrees per hour
   - Total cooling: \(3 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 12 \, \text{degrees}\)

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - Warming rate: 2 degrees per hour
   - Total warming: \(2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{degrees}\)

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:
- Total cooling: \(6 \, \text{degrees} + 12 \, \text{degrees} = 18 \, \text{degrees}\)
- Total warming: \(4 \, \text{degrees}\)

Net change in temperature:
- Net cooling: \(18 \, \text{degrees} - 4 \, \text{degrees} = 14 \, \text{degrees}\)

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

**Final answer: 14 degrees**"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

3. **Determine the time between the first and second sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, so the time between the first and second sightings is 75 years.

4. **Calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and the time between the first and second sightings is 75 years, then Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each type of payment and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill**: He writes one check per month for the electric bill. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

2. **Gas bill**: He writes one check per month for the gas bill. Again, there are 12 months in a year, so he writes:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

3. **Church**: He writes two checks per month to the church. Over the course of a year, he writes:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ checks}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service**: He writes one check every quarter to the pest and lawn service. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes:
   \[
   1 \times 4 = 4 \text{ checks}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52
\]

Therefore, Buford writes a total of 52 checks per year."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips each day. These trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes, so the first plane makes \(44 \times 2 = 88\) trips each day.

2. Out of these 88 trips, three-quarters of the flights are to Greece. So, the number of flights to Greece is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66\).

3. The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The remaining flights are \(88 - 66 = 22\). Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is \(\frac{22}{2} = 11\).

Therefore, the first plane takes \(\boxed{11}\) flights to France in one day."
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we can start by calculating the duration of each wolf's howl.

1. Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds.
3. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Now, we add up the total howling time for all three wolves:
\[20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds}\]

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[120 \div 60 = 2 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and then subtract that from the total cost of the trousers.

1. Adam's mother gave him $6.
2. Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.
3. The total amount of money given by his parents is \(6 + 12 = 18\) dollars.
4. The trousers cost $30.

Now, we subtract the total amount given by his parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings.

\(30 - 18 = 12\)

Adam had to contribute \(\boxed{12}\) dollars from his savings."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(Al\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
- \(A = 3\)
- \(Al = 4\)
- The total age of the children is 20, so \(A + Al + H + W = 20\).
- Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, so \(H = 2 \times \frac{A + Al + H + W}{4}\).

First, substitute the known values into the total age equation:
\[3 + 4 + H + W = 20\]
\[7 + H + W = 20\]
\[H + W = 13\]

Next, substitute the known values into the equation for Helene's age:
\[H = 2 \times \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times \frac{7 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = \frac{2(7 + H + W)}{4}\]
\[H = \frac{14 + 2H + 2W}{4}\]
\[4H = 14 + 2H + 2W\]
\[2H = 14 + 2W\]
\[H = 7 + W\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(H + W = 13\)
2. \(H = 7 + W\)

Substitute the second equation into the first:
\[7 + W + W = 13\]
\[7 + 2W = 13\]
\[2W = 6\]
\[W = 3\]

So, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the total amount of money collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund. This is $500 from the neighbors plus $1500 from the online fund, which totals $2000.

Walter's friend then donates $200. Adding this to the previous total, we get $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Walter's lawyer is going to donate three times the total amount collected from everyone else. Since the total collected from everyone else is $2200, the lawyer's donation will be 3 * $2200 = $6600.

Therefore, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ 50 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is \( 2 + 4 = 6 \). The total size of the watermelon can be represented as the sum of all the slices, which is \( 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \).

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \), and the total size of the watermelon is \( 8x \). Therefore, the fraction of the watermelon that each adult gets is \( \frac{2x}{8x} = \frac{1}{4} \).

To convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his activities and subtract this from the nine hours he has available.

1. **Clinic Work Time**: 9 hours
2. **Inpatient Rounds**: 10 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 200 minutes = 3 hours 20 minutes
3. **Appointments**: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes = 5 hours

Now, let's add up the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments:
- Inpatient Rounds: 3 hours 20 minutes = 3.33 hours (approx.)
- Appointments: 5 hours

Total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments = 3.33 hours + 5 hours = 8.33 hours

Now, subtract the total time spent from the 9 hours available:
- 9 hours - 8.33 hours = 0.67 hours

Therefore, Doctor Jones will have approximately 0.67 hours left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to work backwards from the 5:00 pm serving time, accounting for all the steps required to make the cake.

1. Frosting the cake takes 10 minutes.
2. Cooling the cake takes 2 hours (120 minutes).
3. Baking the cake takes 30 minutes.
4. Making the cake batter takes 20 minutes.

Adding these times together:
10 minutes (frosting) + 120 minutes (cooling) + 30 minutes (baking) + 20 minutes (making batter) = 180 minutes (or 3 hours).

Now, subtract 3 hours from the 5:00 pm serving time:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm.

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to have it ready to serve at 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter.
2. Use the total number of chocolate bars sold to find the number of bars per box.

First, let's add the number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter:
- Lisa sold 3.5 boxes.
- Peter sold 4.5 boxes.

Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

They sold 64 chocolate bars together. To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:

Number of chocolate bars per box = Total chocolate bars / Total boxes
Number of chocolate bars per box = 64 / 8
Number of chocolate bars per box = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per session for the studio.
2. Calculate the total cost per day for the studio.
3. Calculate the total cost per week for the studio.
4. Calculate the total cost per month for the studio.

First, let's calculate the cost per session for the studio:
- The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
- The cost per student per session is $1.50.
- With 10 students, the cost per session for students is \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost per session is \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost per day for the studio:
- The studio is rented 3 days a week.
- So, the total cost per day is \(40 \times 3 = 120\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost per week for the studio:
- The studio is open 3 days a week.
- Therefore, the total cost per week is \(120 \times 3 = 360\) dollars.

Finally, we calculate the total cost per month for the studio:
- Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the total cost per month is \(360 \times 4 = 1440\) dollars.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $1440."
"To solve this problem, we can set up equations based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( P \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( M \).

From the problem, we know:
- Peter has 4 boxes, so the total number of chocolate bars Peter has is \( 4P = 64 \).
- Martha has 7 boxes, so the total number of chocolate bars Martha has is \( 7M = 56 \).

First, we solve for \( P \) and \( M \):

For Peter:
\[ 4P = 64 \]
\[ P = \frac{64}{4} \]
\[ P = 16 \]

For Martha:
\[ 7M = 56 \]
\[ M = \frac{56}{7} \]
\[ M = 8 \]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:
\[ P - M = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

Final numerical answer:
8"
"To find the number of porcupines in the park after a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of female porcupines.
2. Determine the number of baby porcupines born each month.
3. Calculate the total number of baby porcupines born in a year.
4. Add the total number of baby porcupines to the initial population to get the final number of porcupines.

Step 1: Calculate the number of female porcupines.
The number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population.
\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Step 2: Determine the number of baby porcupines born each month.
Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
\[ \text{Number of baby porcupines born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of baby porcupines born in a year.
There are 12 months in a year.
\[ \text{Total number of baby porcupines born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

Step 4: Add the total number of baby porcupines to the initial population to get the final number of porcupines.
\[ \text{Final number of porcupines} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

Final numerical answer:
1490"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, so we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

So, the volume of the pool is:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"To find the total number of sticks, let's break down the information given:

1. There are 9 red sticks.
2. There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so the number of blue sticks is \(9 + 5 = 14\).
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is \(14 - 3 = 11\).

Now, to find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

\[9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34\]

So, the total number of sticks they have is 34."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

For Matteo:
- Speed = 55 miles per hour
- Time = 4 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

For Shandy:
- Speed = 45 miles per hour
- Time = 10 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance traveled by Matteo from the distance traveled by Shandy:
- Difference in distance = Distance traveled by Shandy - Distance traveled by Matteo = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"To find the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the problem into smaller parts.

1. **Total number of students**: 3000

2. **Students over 16 years old**: Half of the total students
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

3. **Male students over 16 years old**: One-fourth of the students over 16 years old
   \[
   \frac{1500}{4} = 375
   \]

4. **Female students over 16 years old**: The remaining students over 16 years old
   \[
   1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

5. **Students under 16 years old**: The other half of the total students
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old**: One-half of the students under 16 years old
   \[
   \frac{1500}{2} = 750
   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old**: The remaining students under 16 years old
   \[
   1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total number of female students**: Sum of female students over 16 and under 16
   \[
   1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is **1875**."
"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run in one hour:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(14 / 2 = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

\(10 - 5 = 5\)

Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
   - Tank's capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Water filled by Wanda on the first day = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
   - Water filled by Ms. B on the first day = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the first day = \( 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \) gallons.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water pumped by Wanda on the second day = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final charge percentage to the initial charge percentage when Maria left for the park.

Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( C \).

1. **First 5 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour.
   - After 5 hours, the charge remaining is \( C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).

2. **Next 3 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour.
   - After these 3 hours, the charge remaining is \( C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = 0.28 \]

First, calculate the factors:
\[ (1 - 0.09) = 0.91 \]
\[ (1 - 0.07) = 0.93 \]

Now, raise these to their respective powers:
\[ 0.91^5 \approx 0.624 \]
\[ 0.93^3 \approx 0.804 \]

Multiply these together:
\[ 0.624 \times 0.804 \approx 0.501 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ C \times 0.501 = 0.28 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.501} \approx 0.559 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 55.9%."
"First, let's calculate Janet's total earnings per hour from both wages and tips:

- Hourly wage: $10
- Hourly tips: $15
- Total hourly earnings: $10 + $15 = $25

Next, we need to determine how much she wants to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of a $10,000 car:

- Down payment: 20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Now, we need to find out how much Janet earns in a week. She works 40 hours a week:

- Weekly earnings: $25/hour * 40 hours/week = $1,000/week

Finally, we need to calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save $2,000:

- Weeks needed: $2,000 / $1,000/week = 2 weeks

Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jamaar has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost of the items already purchased:

\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10, so the amount of money he has left after his purchases is:

\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:

\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums."
"First, let's calculate the total number of sweets Anne has:

Total packs = 15
Sweets per pack = 60

Total sweets = 15 packs * 60 sweets/pack = 900 sweets

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is:

Packs given to friends = Total packs - Packs kept by Anne
Packs given to friends = 15 - 2 = 13 packs

Now, we need to find out how many sweets are in these 13 packs:

Sweets given to friends = 13 packs * 60 sweets/pack = 780 sweets

Anne gave these 780 sweets equally to her 10 friends, so the number of sweets each friend received is:

Sweets per friend = Sweets given to friends / Number of friends
Sweets per friend = 780 sweets / 10 friends = 78 sweets

Each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply a 5% increase to the original price each year. The original price is $120.

1. **First Year:**
   \[
   \text{Price after first year} = 120 + (120 \times 0.05) = 120 \times 1.05 = 126
   \]

2. **Second Year:**
   \[
   \text{Price after second year} = 126 + (126 \times 0.05) = 126 \times 1.05 = 132.30
   \]

3. **Third Year:**
   \[
   \text{Price after third year} = 132.30 + (132.30 \times 0.05) = 132.30 \times 1.05 = 139.465

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Olivia uploaded 72 pictures in total.
2. She divided these pictures equally into 8 albums.
3. Each album would then contain \( \frac{72}{8} = 9 \) pictures.

Now, we know that 3 of these albums were selfies only and 2 of the albums were portraits only. This means that the remaining 3 albums (8 total - 3 selfies - 2 portraits) must contain a mix of selfies and portraits.

Since each of the 8 albums has 9 pictures, the total number of pictures in the 3 selfies albums is \( 3 \times 9 = 27 \) selfies, and the total number of pictures in the 2 portraits albums is \( 2 \times 9 = 18 \) portraits.

The remaining 3 albums, which contain a mix of selfies and portraits, have \( 3 \times 9 = 27 \) pictures in total. However, we don't need to distribute these further to find the total number of selfies and portraits.

So, the total number of selfies is 27, and the total number of portraits is 18.

Final numerical answer:
\[
\text{Total selfies: } 27, \text{ Total portraits: } 18

"To find out how long James spends reading, we can first determine how long it takes him to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time per page as follows:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} \]

Now, we know he reads 18 pages. So, the total time spent reading 18 pages is:

\[ \text{Total time} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} \]

\[ \text{Total time} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} \]

\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \times 10 \]

\[ \text{Total time} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

James spends 60 minutes reading."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Guests**: The hotel starts with 100 guests.
2. **Early Checkouts**: 24 guests check out early. So, the number of guests becomes \(100 - 24 = 76\).
3. **Late Checkouts**: 15 guests check out late. So, the number of guests becomes \(76 - 15 = 61\).
4. **Afternoon Check-ins**: Twice as many people check in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice that number is \(2 \times 15 = 30\). So, the number of guests becomes \(61 + 30 = 91\).
5. **Dinner Check-ins**: 7 more people check in after dinner. So, the number of guests becomes \(91 + 7 = 98\).

Therefore, the hotel now has 98 guests."

Therefore, Aries is sure to get 36 points."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the price of a small stuffed animal be \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal be \( L \).
2. According to the problem, \( L = 3S \).
3. Given that each small stuffed animal costs $4, we have \( S = 4 \).
4. Therefore, the price of a large stuffed animal \( L = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Now, let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( x \). Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (\text{Number of large stuffed animals} \times \text{Price of a large stuffed animal}) + (\text{Number of small stuffed animals} \times \text{Price of a small stuffed animal}) \]
\[ 120 = (x \times 12) + (2x \times 4) \]
\[ 120 = 12x + 8x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals. Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals."

"The Easter egg hunt team hid a total of 100 eggs. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found:

\[30 + 30 = 60\]

This means that the number of eggs left to be found by the friends is:

\[100 - 60 = 40\]

However, it's stated that all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. This means that the friends found:

\[40 - 10 = 30\]

So, the friends found 30 eggs.

30"
"First, let's determine the amount of ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day. We know that a dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is:

\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ pounds per day} \]

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. So, the amount of ore mined per day with a steel pickaxe is:

\[ 24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days, each using a steel pickaxe. The total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves in one day is:

\[ 40 \times 36 = 1440 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Over 30 days, the total amount of ore mined is:

\[ 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{43200} \]"
"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich for each package and then use that to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

First, let's calculate the price per sandwich for each package:

1. For the first package:
   - 2 sandwiches for $3
   - Price per sandwich = $3 / 2 = $1.50

2. For the second package:
   - 4 sandwiches for $6
   - Price per sandwich = $6 / 4 = $1.50

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages, which is $1.50.

Now, we can find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
- Cost = 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12."
"First, we need to determine the remaining amount Tom needs to pay after selling his old bedroom set. He buys a new one for $3000 and sells his old one for $1000, so the remaining amount is:

\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% of this remaining amount each month. To find out how much he needs to pay per month, we calculate 10% of $2000:

\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ 200 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst due to the wind. 

\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]

So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving her with:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of her 12 yellow balloons:

\[ 12 \times 0.50 = 6 \]

So, she lost 6 yellow balloons, leaving her with:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

As she approached the school, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her collection:

\[ 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]

Adding these 6 blue balloons to her remaining balloons:

\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 6 \text{ (blue)} = 27 \]

Therefore, the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school is:

\[ 27 \]"
"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.5
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. So, the probability of not having to turn in his homework in this scenario is 100% or 1.0.

2. **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.4
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.6
   - If the normal teacher gives an extension, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. So, the probability of not having to turn in his homework in this scenario is 0.4.

3. **Normal Teacher without Extension, Marcus Gets a Personal Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.6
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension: 20% or 0.2
   - Probability of Marcus not getting a personal extension: 80% or 0.8
   - If Marcus does not get a personal extension, he has to turn in his homework. So, the probability of having to turn in his homework in this scenario is 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.48.

Now, we combine these probabilities:

- Probability of having a substitute teacher and not having to turn in homework: 0.5 * 1.0 = 0.5
- Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension and not having to turn in homework: 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2
- Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus not getting a personal extension and having to turn in homework: 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.24

The total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of the scenarios where he does not get an extension:

0.24

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

24%"

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the different sizes of jelly beans and how many Grandpa can eat.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium jelly beans as large jelly beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium jelly beans Grandpa can eat is \( 2 \times 75 = 150 \).

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium jelly bean.
   - Therefore, the number of small jelly beans that is equivalent to 150 medium jelly beans is \( 3 \times 150 = 450 \).

So, Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans. 

**Final Answer:**

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of soda bottles Richard will place.
2. Determine the total time it will take to place all the bottles and drop the candy.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of soda bottles.**

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. This means the number of intervals between the bottles is 24 / 3 = 8. Since there is a bottle at the start and one at the end of each interval, the total number of bottles is 8 + 1 = 9.

**Step 2: Determine the total time.**

Richard takes 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next. Since there are 8 intervals between the 9 bottles, the total time to place all the bottles and drop the candy is 8 * 5 = 40 seconds.

**Final Answer:**
40 seconds"
"First, we need to determine the total number of apples Uncle Franky has. Since there are forty apples in one box and he ordered two boxes, we can calculate the total number of apples as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ apples/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of apples he can make if each pack contains eight apples. We do this by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:

\[ 80 \text{ apples} \div 8 \text{ apples/pack} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make \(\boxed{10}\) packs of apples."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese Amor buys and then subtract that from the $50 she starts with.

So, Amor will have \(\boxed{10}\) dollars left to buy meat."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim borrowed for college, the total income he would have earned without going to college, and the total income he will earn with his college degree. Then, we can determine how long it will take for him to earn back the money he spent and lost.

1. **Calculate the total amount borrowed for college:**
   - Jim borrows $50,000 per year for 4 years.
   - Total amount borrowed = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

2. **Calculate the total income lost from not working while in school:**
   - Jim's annual income before college was $25,000.
   - He did not earn this income for 4 years.
   - Total income lost = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn back:**
   - Total amount to earn back = Total amount borrowed + Total income lost
   - Total amount to earn back = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

4. **Calculate Jim's new annual income after earning a college degree:**
   - His income tripled after earning the degree.
   - New annual income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000.

5. **Calculate how long it will take for Jim to earn back the $300,000:**
   - Time to earn back = Total amount to earn back / New annual income
   - Time to earn back = $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces he requires. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece is:
6 feet (bed length) + 2 feet = 8 feet

And the width of each fabric piece is:
8 feet (bed width) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
Area = Length × Width
Area = 8 feet × 10 feet = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
Total area = 80 square feet × 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Monday's Delivery:**
   - The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday's Delivery:**
   - One-fifth of Monday's delivery: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)

3. **Wednesday's Delivery:**
   - Twice as many as Tuesday's delivery: \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \)
   - 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery: \( 204 + 5 = 209 \)

4. **Total Delivery from Monday to Wednesday:**
   - Monday: 425 letters
   - Tuesday: 102 letters

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. So, he won \(2 \times 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11\) dollars.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost and won:

- Total loss: $5 (first race) + $16.5 (third race) = $21.5
- Total win: $11 (second race)

Net loss: $21.5 - $11 = $10.5

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races:

\[
\text{Average loss} = \frac{\text{Total loss}}{\text{Number of races}} = \frac{10.5}{3} = 3.5
\]

So, Johnny's dad lost on average $3.5 per race that day."
"To find the total population of South America based on the given information, we can follow these steps:

2. Determine the population of each city: Each city has 1000 people.
3. Calculate the total population: Multiply the number of cities by the population of each city. So, the total population is \(130 \times 1000 = 130,000\).

Therefore, the total population of South America, based on the given conditions, is 130,000 people."
"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we first need to calculate their current heights.

Xavier was originally 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert Xavier's original height to inches:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
Adding the growth:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was originally 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem, the second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation as:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is $420."
"To determine the total hours of work each painter put in, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days the painters worked.
2. Determine the total fraction of a day worked each day.
3. Convert the fraction of a day into hours.
4. Calculate the total hours worked by the team.
5. Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours each painter worked.

Let's start with step 1: The team worked for 3 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days is:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Step 2: Each painter worked \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day every day.

Step 3: Convert \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day into hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day:
\[ \frac{3}{8} \text{ of a day} = \frac{3}{8} \times 24 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Step 4: Calculate the total hours worked by the team. There are 4 painters, and each worked 9 hours per day for 21 days:
\[ 4 \text{ painters} \times 9 \text{ hours/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 756 \text{ hours} \]

Step 5: Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours each painter worked:
\[ \frac{756 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ painters}} = 189 \text{ hours} \]

So, each painter put in 189 hours of work."
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
1. In the first set, he retrieved four more balls than in the second set, so he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
2. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
3. The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) + 2(4) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + x + 8 = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, we can find the number of balls he retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% of its value each year (100% - 21% = 79%).

The formula to calculate the value after depreciation is:
\[ \text{Value after depreciation} = \text{Initial value} \times (1 - \text{depreciation rate})^{\text{number of years}} \]

Here, the initial value is $20,000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years is 3 (from 2007 to 2010).

Let's calculate the value in 2010:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the price of the car in 2010 is $9861.

Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 is $9861."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of English books.
2. Calculate the number of German books.
3. Subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books.

Step 1: Calculate the number of English books.
Half of the 50 books are in English, so:
\[ \text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of German books.
10% of the 50 books are in German, so:
\[ \text{Number of German books} = 50 \times \frac{10}{100} = 5 \]

Step 3: Calculate the number of Spanish books.
Subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:
\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (\text{Number of English books} + \text{Number of German books}) \]
\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (25 + 5) = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, there are 20 Spanish books in the library."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we first need to calculate the total distance she has already covered and then subtract that from the total distance between San Diego and New York City.

The total distance is 1955 kilometers.

Bernice drove 325 kilometers for 4 days. Since the problem does not specify a different distance for each day, we assume she drove 325 kilometers in total over the 4 days.

Now, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance:

1955 kilometers (total distance) - 325 kilometers (distance already driven) = 1630 kilometers

So, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers."
"Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Over 30 days, she would drink:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, the number of gallons she drinks in 30 days is:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:

   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people get off the train, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 people get off the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:

"To determine the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor with the new square floor tiles, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of tiles needed.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of tiles and their cost per tile.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of tiles needed.**

Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is:
\[ 1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt} \]

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt. Therefore, the number of tiles needed is:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ SqFt}}{1 \text{ SqFt per tile}} = 200 \text{ tiles} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost.**

Each tile costs $12. Therefore, the total cost for 200 tiles is:
\[ 200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars per tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

**Final Answer:**
\[ \text{The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor is } \$2400. \]"
"First, we need to calculate the increased monthly cost of the insurance after the accident. The normal cost is $120 a month, and it increased by 60%. 

To find the increased amount, we calculate 60% of $120:
\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the new monthly cost is the original cost plus the increase:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Now, to find the annual cost, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for the insurance."
"Greg uses 4 twin beds + 1 king bed = 5 beds per week.

Since he washes 2 twin sets and 1 king set per load, each load can clean 4 beds (2 twins + 1 king).

"Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend (Saturday and Sunday), they watch a total of 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

If they continue this pattern for 4 weeks, the total number of movies they can watch is 6 movies/weekend * 4 weekends = 24 movies.

"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so his collection increased to:
100 (previous amount) + 50 (collected last year) = 150 stickers.

This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as last year, which is:
2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Adding this year's collection to his last year's total gives:
150 (last year's total) + 100 (collected this year) = 250 stickers.

So, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection."
"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food consumed per day and then divide the total amount of cat food by this daily consumption.

1. Calculate the daily consumption of cat food:
   - Imma has 3 cats.
   - Each cat is fed 60 grams of food twice a day.
   - Therefore, each cat consumes \(60 \, \text{grams} \times 2 = 120 \, \text{grams}\) per day.
   - For 3 cats, the total daily consumption is \(120 \, \text{grams} \times 3 = 360 \, \text{grams}\).

2. Calculate how many days 720 grams of cat food will last:
   - Total cat food available: 720 grams.
   - Daily consumption: 360 grams.
   - Number of days the food will last: \( \frac{720 \, \text{grams}}{360 \, \text{grams/day}} = 2 \, \text{days} \).

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \(7 \times 2 = 14\) slices. 

To find the total number of slices they ate, we add the slices eaten by each person:
\[10 + 7 + 14 = 31\]

So, the total number of slices they ate is 31."
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, we can express Betsy's part as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for the meal is the sum of both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, we calculate Betsy's part as:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long."
"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to add up all the individual charges:

1. **Cast**: $200
2. **Doctor's Visit**: The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the charge would be half of $300, which is $150.
3. **Painkillers**: $4 per pill for 30 pills, which totals to $4 * 30 = $120.
4. **Parking**: $6 per hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours, which totals to $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, we add all these charges together:

$200 (cast) + $150 (doctor's visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"First, we need to determine how many emails James receives in a day that require a response. Since 20% of the emails don't require any response, that means 80% of the emails do require a response.

The number of emails that require a response each day is:
\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \]

Next, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week. We do this by multiplying the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:
\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 320 \]"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to add up the number of classes that visited each day.

- Monday: 32 classes
- Tuesday: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes
- Wednesday: Three times as many as Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes
- Thursday: 30 classes
- Friday: 25 classes

Now, let's add these numbers together:

\[32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25\]

First, add 32 and 64:

\[32 + 64 = 96\]

Next, add 96 and 96:

\[96 + 96 = 192\]

Then, add 30:

\[192 + 30 = 222\]

Finally, add 25:

\[222 + 25 = 247\]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."
"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we first need to calculate the total score for all tests and then divide by the number of tests.

John's scores are:
- 100 on the first test
- 100 on the second test
- 100 on the third test
- 80 on the fourth test

The total score is:
100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

The average score is the total score divided by the number of tests:
380 / 4 = 95

Therefore, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate:

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. So, the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club is:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of pizzas left from the glee club's order is:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \]

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ate:

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

The football team ate 80% of their pizzas. So, the number of pizzas eaten by the football team is:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]

Therefore, the number of pizzas left from the football team's order is:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \]

Finally, to find the total number of pizzas left, we add the remaining pizzas from both the glee club and the football team:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 14 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send out. Since he wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he is sending out 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

\[ 24500 \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. One meatball sub contains 4 meatballs.
2. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means Sidney ordered \(10 - 3 = 7\) meatball sub sandwiches.
3. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, so Sidney had \(7 - 4 = 3\) meatball sub sandwiches left.
4. Sidney then ordered another three sub sandwiches, so Sidney now has \(3 + 3 = 6\) meatball sub sandwiches in total.

Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the 6 sub sandwiches is \(6 \times 4 = 24\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of trucks that had mechanical failures.
2. Calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser.
3. Calculate the total amount of fertiliser delivered.

Step 1: Calculate the number of trucks with mechanical failures.
A quarter of the 20 trucks had mechanical failures:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks} \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser.
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of fertiliser delivered.
Each truck carried 20 tons of fertiliser, so:
\[ 15 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 300 \text{ tons} \]

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:
\[ 300 \text{ tons} \]"
"Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. Since he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter he buys, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.

Let's calculate the cost without the promotion first:
- Cost per pound of butter = $4.00
- Total pounds of butter needed = 6
- Total cost without promotion = 6 * $4.00 = $24.00

Now, let's apply the promotion:
- For every pound of butter, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.
- This means for every 1.5 pounds of butter, he only pays for 1 pound.

To find out how many 1.5 pound units are in 6 pounds:
- 6 pounds / 1.5 pounds per unit = 4 units

For each unit, he pays for 1 pound at full price and gets 0.5 pounds at half price. The cost for each unit is:
- Cost for 1 pound = $4.00
- Cost for 0.5 pounds at half price = $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00
- Total cost per unit = $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00

Since he needs 4 units:
- Total cost with promotion = 4 * $6.00 = $24.00

Therefore, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter with the promotion is $24.00."
"First, let's calculate the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- 25 classmates
- 7 girls in her dance class
- 13 family members

Total guests invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Since 4 people said they could not come, the actual number of guests attending the party is:

45 - 4 = 41

The cost to rent the theater is $125, and there is an additional $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20. So, the number of additional guests is:

41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is:

21 * $6 = $126

Adding the rental fee to the cost for the additional guests gives us the total cost:

$125 + $126 = $251

The total cost of the party is $251."
"Let's start by calculating how much money Maggie and Riza each had initially.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has three-quarters of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times \text{Maggie's initial money} = 60
\]

Solving for Maggie's initial money:

\[
\text{Maggie's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
\]

Similarly, Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has two-thirds of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times \text{Riza's initial money} = 60
\]

Solving for Riza's initial money:

\[
\text{Riza's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
\]

Now, let's calculate how much money each of them had initially and how much they have left.

Maggie initially had $80 and spent a quarter, so she has $60 left.
Riza initially had $90 and spent one-third, so she has $60 left.

Adding the amounts they have left:

\[
60 + 60 = 120
\]

Therefore, the two of them have a total of $120 left."
"First, let's determine the total number of bananas each monkey eats in a week.

- The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. So, in a week (7 days), the first monkey eats \(10 \times 7 = 70\) bananas.
- The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day, so it eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day. In a week, the second monkey eats \(14 \times 7 = 98\) bananas.
- The total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a week is \(70 + 98 = 168\) bananas.

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas to feed the three monkeys for a week, the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week is \(315 - 168 = 147\) bananas.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide the weekly total by 7:
\[ \frac{147}{7} = 21 \]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

Final numerical answer:
21"

250 (from the first puzzle) + 500 (from the second puzzle) = 750 pieces.

750 pieces"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 15 roses. Since roses can be bought at $2 each, the cost for 15 roses would be:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which amounts to:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she needs an additional $5 to cover the cost. The florist can only give change in quarters, and since 1 quarter is worth $0.25, we need to find out how many quarters make up $5:

\[ \$5 \div \$0.25/\text{quarter} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, Jenny needs 20 quarters to cover the additional $5. Since the florist can only give change in quarters, Jenny will leave with 20 quarters as change. 

Jenny leaves with 20 quarters."
"To calculate the total money Terry makes, we need to multiply the quantity of each item by its price and then sum up the totals.

Therefore, Terry makes a total of $162.00."
"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find the difference between the time Paul boards the fourth train and the time he arrives at the station.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Departs after 30 minutes (10 minutes arrival + 20 minutes stay).

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train departs, which is 60 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Stays for a quarter of the first train's stay time, which is 5 minutes (20 minutes / 4).
   - Departs after 65 minutes (60 minutes arrival + 5 minutes stay).

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train departs, which is 125 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Leaves immediately after arriving, so it departs at 125 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train departs, which is 145 minutes after the first train arrives.

Paul will board the fourth train at 145 minutes after he arrives at the station. Since he arrives at the station at the start (0 minutes), he will wait 145 minutes for his train.

**Final Answer:**
145 minutes"
"To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to calculate how many toothpicks she has already saved and then determine how many more she needs to save.

1. Calculate the total number of toothpicks Melanie has saved so far:
   - She saves 10 toothpicks each week.
   - She has been saving for 12 weeks.
   - Total saved = 10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks.

2. Calculate the number of toothpicks Melanie still needs to save:
   - Total required = 200 toothpicks.
   - Toothpicks already saved = 120 toothpicks.
   - Toothpicks still needed = 200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks.

3. Calculate the number of weeks it will take to save the remaining toothpicks:
   - Toothpicks saved per week = 10.
   - Weeks needed = 80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks.

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price, which is $2000.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to calculate the difference between the original price and the price Mr. Rogers' friend paid, and then express this difference as a percentage of the original price.

\[ \text{Discount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, a single spring creates 1 jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - 1 minute = 60 seconds
   - Therefore, 4 hours = 4 × 60 × 60 = 14,400 seconds

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since 1 jellyfish is created every second, in 14,400 seconds, 1 spring will create 14,400 jellyfish.

4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If 1 spring creates 14,400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create 5 × 14,400 jellyfish.

5. **Final calculation:**
   - 5 × 14,400 = 72,000 jellyfish

Therefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72,000 jellyfish in 4 hours."
"To find Frankie's score, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that Binkie's score is 90, and Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score.

First, we calculate twice Binkie's score:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Next, we add 15 to this result to find Frankie's score:
\[ 180 + 15 = 195 \]

So, Frankie's score is 195."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. James's home is 4 miles from the store.
2. He walks halfway to the store, which is 2 miles.
3. He then walks back home, which is another 2 miles.
4. In total, he walks 4 miles (2 miles to the halfway point and 2 miles back home).

Since he walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it takes for him to walk 4 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed

Plugging in the values:

Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1 hour

So, it took James 1 hour to reach the halfway point and return home. 

The final numerical answer is:
1 hour"
"First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from buying 10 bunches. Since each bunch averages 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas/bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we calculate the cost if Jenny had bought these bananas individually. At $0.80 per banana, the total cost would be:

\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80/\text{banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since she bought 10 bunches at $3.00 per bunch, the total cost is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00/\text{bunch} = \$30.00 \]

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:

\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Jenny saved \(\$2.00\) by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \).

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total length of the fence is 100 feet.
2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( S + H = 100 \)
2. \( H = S + 60 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]
\[ 2S = 40 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. 

Final numerical answer:

"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to determine the growth rate per year. 

Given that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, we can calculate the annual growth rate as follows:

\[ \text{Annual growth rate} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \]

Now, to find out how much the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we multiply the annual growth rate by 13:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"First, let's calculate the number of each type of bike sold:

1. **Trekking bikes**: Half of the total bikes sold were Trekking bikes.
   \[
   \text{Trekking bikes} = \frac{300}{2} = 150
   \]

2. **BMX bikes**: 15% of the total bikes sold were BMX bikes.
   \[
   \text{BMX bikes} = 0.15 \times 300 = 45
   \]

3. **MTB bikes**: The rest of the bikes sold were MTB bikes.
   \[
   \text{MTB bikes} = 300 - 150 - 45 = 105
   \]

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:

1. **Earnings from Trekking bikes**:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from Trekking bikes} = 150 \times 450 = 67500
   \]

2. **Earnings from BMX bikes**:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from BMX bikes} = 45 \times \left(\frac{500}{2}\right) = 45 \times 250 = 11250
   \]

3. **Earnings from MTB bikes**:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from MTB bikes} = 105 \times 500 = 52500

Marcel earned \(\boxed{131250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the rate of hay production and pickup:**
   - The farmer makes 5 bales of hay per hour.
   - The truck picks up 3 bales of hay per hour.

2. **Calculate the net change in the number of hay bales per hour:**
   - Net change per hour = Hay produced - Hay picked up
   - Net change per hour = 5 bales - 3 bales = 2 bales

3. **Calculate the total net change over 6 hours:**
   - Total net change = Net change per hour * Number of hours
   - Total net change = 2 bales/hour * 6 hours = 12 bales

4. **Determine the initial number of hay bales:**
   - Since the problem does not specify an initial number of hay bales, we assume there are no hay bales in the field at the start of the day.

5. **Calculate the number of hay bales left in the field after 6 hours:**
   - Initial number of hay bales = 0
   - Number of hay bales left = Initial number of hay bales + Total net change
   - Number of hay bales left = 0 + 12 bales = 12 bales

Therefore, after 6 hours, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long. Therefore, the total time spent in classes each weekday is:

\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total time spent in classes during the weekdays is:

\[ 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on these days. First, we find \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly class time:

\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he spends this amount of time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time for the weekend is:

\[ 100 \text{ minutes} \times 2 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent in classes during the weekdays and the extra learning time on the weekend to get the total weekly learning time:

\[ 1600 \text{ minutes} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, John spends 30 hours a week learning."
"To find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped.
2. Calculate the height after the first bounce.
3. Calculate the height after the second bounce.

The initial height from which the ball is dropped is 3 stories high, with each story being 24 feet. So, the initial height is:
\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. So, the height after the first bounce is:
\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

For the second bounce, the ball will again bounce to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce. So, the height after the second bounce is:
\[ 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:
\[ \boxed{32 \text{ feet}} \]"
"The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we first need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now, if each bag is sold for $5, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags by the price per bag:

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the Triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the Triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The Velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which means \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \) kilograms.

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the Triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate."
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of \(10 \times 8 = 80\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is \(80 \times 2 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of \(5 \times 8 = 40\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is \(40 \times 2 = 80\) square feet.

Adding these together, the total area to be painted is \(160 + 80 = 240\) square feet.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is \(240 \div 20 = 12\) gallons.

Finally, since each gallon costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is \(12 \times 12 = 144\) dollars.

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is $144."
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the probability step by step.

1. Ellen starts with a case of 12 sodas and shakes 3 of them.
2. She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas in total.
3. Ellen's brother takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. This leaves 2 shaken sodas and 7 unshaken sodas.

Now, we need to find the probability that Ellen's friend gets one of the shaken sodas from the remaining 9 sodas.

The total number of sodas left is 9 (2 shaken + 7 unshaken).

The number of shaken sodas left is 2.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{2}{9} \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ \frac{2}{9} \times 100 \approx 22.22\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately 22.22%."
"To find out how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, the distance it has traveled is:
\[ 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is:
\[ \frac{60 \, \text{miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \]
After 3 hours, the distance it has traveled is:
\[ 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the distances together gives the total distance between the two trains after 3 hours:
\[ 180 \, \text{miles} + 90 \, \text{miles} = 270 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, after 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart."
"First, let's calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th. 

- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days.
- April 1st to April 19th is 19 days.

So, the total number of days is \(31 + 19 = 50\) days.

Billy takes 20% of these days off. To find out how many days he takes off, we calculate 20% of 50:

\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \text{ days} \]

So, Billy works on \(50 - 10 = 40\) days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day. Therefore, the number of people he helps per day is:

\[ 2 \text{ people/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 6 \text{ people/day} \]

Now, to find out how many people he helps in 40 days, we multiply the number of people he helps per day by the number of days he works:

\[ 6 \text{ people/day} \times 40 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ people} \]

So, Billy helps \(\boxed{240}\) people."
"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry. 

First, let's calculate the number of people that the buses could carry:
- There were 12 buses.
- Each bus carried 35 people.

So, the total number of people carried by the buses is:
\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people/bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of people that the cars could carry:
- There were 20 cars.
- Each car carried 3 people.

So, the total number of people carried by the cars is:
\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people/car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Now, we add the number of people carried by the buses and the cars to find the total number of people inside the church:
\[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people inside the church is:
\[ 480 \]"
"To find out how old Jeff is, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. Mike is 24 years old.
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, so Martha's age is \(24 - 4 = 20\) years old.
3. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so Jeff's age is \(20 + 10 = 30\) years old.

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old."
"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute

Time to ride the biggest slide = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute

Time to ride the second biggest slide = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time:
Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

It takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and two 15-minute breaks each day. 

First, let's calculate the total time spent on breaks and lunch each day:
- Lunch: 30 minutes
- Break 1: 15 minutes
- Break 2: 15 minutes

Total time per day = 30 + 15 + 15 = 60 minutes

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, Bobby spends 1 hour each day on his lunch and breaks.

Over 5 days, the total time spent on lunch and breaks is:
1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours

Final numerical answer:
5 hours"
"First, let's calculate how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (\text{Amber's distance} + \text{Micah's distance}) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (8 + 28) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - 36 \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Ahito ran 16 miles."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Sheila initially charged $85.00.
2. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract this from the initial charge: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.
3. She then bought a frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00. The sale price of the frying pan is: $20.00 - (20% of $20.00) = $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.
4. She also bought a set of towels on sale for 10% off $30.00. The sale price of the towels is: $30.00 - (10% of $30.00) = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.
5. Adding the sale prices of the frying pan and the towels to the remaining balance: $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00.

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation:

\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90."
"To find Caroline's age, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. Chris is 4 years old.
2. Ben is two times older than Chris, so Ben's age is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) years.
3. Caroline is three times older than Ben, so Caroline's age is \(3 \times 8 = 24\) years.

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old."
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs for her retirement and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount given her current savings rate.

1. **Calculate the annual retirement income needed:**
   Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary during retirement.
   \[
   \text{Annual retirement income} = 0.40 \times \$100,000 = \$40,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the total retirement savings needed:**
   Lauren plans to live off this amount for 20 years.
   \[
   \text{Total retirement savings needed} = \$40,000 \times 20 = \$800,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount Lauren saves each year:**
   Lauren saves 20% of her current annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual savings} = 0.20 \times \$100,000 = \$20,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of years needed to save the total retirement amount:**
   To find out how many years it will take to save \$800,000 with annual savings of \$20,000, we divide the total retirement savings needed by the annual savings.
   \[
   \text{Number of years} = \frac{\$800,000}{\$20,000} = 40 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her retirement."
"Marty starts with 100 centimeters of ribbon. He first cuts this into 4 equal parts. To find the length of each of these parts, we divide 100 by 4:

\[ \frac{100}{4} = 25 \text{ centimeters} \]

Each of these 25 centimeter parts is then divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these final parts, we divide 25 by 5:

\[ \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ centimeters} \]

So, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long."
"To find the total school population, we start by noting that 40% of the school population is 240 boys. We can set up the following equation to find the total population (P):

\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To solve for P, we divide both sides by 0.40:

\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

So, the total school population is 600.

Since 40% of the school population is boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of the total population:

\[ 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."
"To find out how much money your mom spent at the gardening shop, we need to add the cost of the pots and the garden soil, and then subtract the coupon amount.

The cost of the pots is $19.
The cost of the garden soil is $26.
The coupon provides a discount of $7.

So, the total cost before the coupon is:
$19 + $26 = $45

After applying the coupon, the total cost is:
$45 - $7 = $38

Therefore, your mom spent $38 at the gardening shop."
"To find the average height of the heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide by the number of women.

First, we calculate the total height of the heels:
- Three women are wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

Adding these together gives the total height of all the heels:
\[12 + 6 = 18\] inches.

Next, we find the average height by dividing the total height by the number of women:
\[ \text{Average height} = \frac{18}{6} = 3 \] inches.

The average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To complete her journey of 9,300 miles in June, we need to determine how many miles per day Soledad must hike if she wants to finish on time.

First, let's calculate the total number of days in June:
- June has 30 days.

Next, let's determine how many miles Soledad plans to hike each day if she walks twice a day, covering 125 miles each time:
- Miles per day = 125 miles * 2 = 250 miles.

Now, let's calculate the total miles she plans to hike in June:
- Total planned miles = 250 miles/day * 30 days = 7,500 miles.

Since her goal is to hike 9,300 miles, we need to find out how many more miles per day she must hike to reach this goal:
- Additional miles needed = 9,300 miles - 7,500 miles = 1,800 miles.
- Additional miles per day = 1,800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles/day.

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

60 miles/day"
"To find out how much the store will have received after all the balls are sold, we need to calculate the total revenue from each color of ball and then sum these amounts.

1. **Red balls:**
   - Number of red balls: 3
   - Cost per red ball: $9
   - Total revenue from red balls: \(3 \times 9 = 27\)

2. **Blue balls:**
   - Number of blue balls: 11
   - Cost per blue ball: $5
   - Total revenue from blue balls: \(11 \times 5 = 55\)

3. **Green balls:**
   - Number of green balls: 25
   - Cost per green ball: $3
   - Total revenue from green balls: \(25 \times 3 = 75\)

Now, we sum the total revenue from all the balls:
\[27 + 55 + 75 = 157\]

The store will have received \(\boxed{157}\) dollars after all the balls are sold."
"First, let's determine how much Pierre and Paul want in kilograms.

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \, \text{kg} \]

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \, \text{kg} \]

Together, Pierre and Paul want:
\[ 3 \, \text{kg} + 4 \, \text{kg} = 7 \, \text{kg} \]

Since Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples in total, the amount left for Jacques (and James, assuming the question meant Jacques) is:
\[ 12 \, \text{kg} - 7 \, \text{kg} = 5 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, James will have 5 kilograms of apples left."
"The temperature started at 2 degrees Celsius. It dropped by 8 degrees, so the temperature became:

2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius.

Then it increased by 3 degrees, so the temperature became:

-6 + 3 = -3 degrees Celsius.

Therefore, the temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Raymond starts with $21.
2. He saves an additional $11 from his allowance.
3. He spends $5 on a comic book.
4. He spends $19 on a puzzle.

First, we add the money he saved to his initial amount:
\[ 21 + 11 = 32 \]

Next, we subtract the cost of the comic book:
\[ 32 - 5 = 27 \]

Then, we subtract the cost of the puzzle:
\[ 27 - 19 = 8 \]

So, the final amount of money Raymond has left is:
\[ 8 \]

Therefore, Raymond has $8 left."
"First, let's determine how much money Anna spent in total. She started with a budget of $16 and has $2 left after her purchases. So, the total amount spent is:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Anna had already spent $4 before buying the 2 books today. Therefore, the amount spent on the 2 books is:

\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Since she bought 2 books and they cost the same amount, the cost of each book is:

\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, each book cost $5."
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we first need to calculate the 20% increase in the number of students from last year.

Last year's enrollment: 50 students

20% of 50 students = 0.20 * 50 = 10 students

Now, we add this increase to last year's enrollment to find this year's enrollment:

50 students + 10 students = 60 students

This year, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class."
"To determine how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times, we first need to find the rate at which the light blinks. We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. 

First, we calculate the number of blinks per minute:
\[ \text{Blinks per minute} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Next, we use this rate to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times."
"Initially, Tate has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

After buying more fish, Tate has:
- 4 + 2 = 6 male guppies
- 7 + 1 = 8 female guppies
- 3 + 2 = 5 male goldfishes
- 5 + 3 = 8 female goldfishes

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes = 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11
- Total female fishes = 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16

The difference between the number of female and male fishes is:
- 16 (female) - 11 (male) = 5

Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes."
"To solve this problem, let's break down the time each person took to complete their chores:

1. **Amalia's time**: Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.
2. **Megan's time**: Megan's chore took 2 hours longer than Amalia's, so Megan took \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours to walk the dog.
3. **Dior's time**: Dior's chore took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia's, so Dior took \(4 + 4 + 1 = 9\) hours to do laundry (since ""well over 4 hours"" means at least 5 hours, and the smallest integer over 4 is 5, but to ensure ""well over,"" we can use 9 as a clear example).

Now, we add up the time each person took:

- Amalia: 4 hours
- Megan: 6 hours
- Dior: 9 hours

Total time = \(4 + 6 + 9 = 19\) hours.

Therefore, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 19 hours."
"To find out how many miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the one-way distance to his parents' place.
2. Multiply the one-way distance by 2 to get the round trip distance.
3. Multiply the round trip distance by the number of visits per month.

First, we know that John drives for 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph. The formula to calculate distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, the one-way distance is:

\[ \text{One-way distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Since he makes a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:

\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

John visits his parents twice a month, so we multiply the round trip distance by the number of visits:

\[ \text{Total monthly distance} = 280 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 560 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, John drives 560 miles a month when visiting his parents."
"Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. Over 7 days, she will walk:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, the distance Brian will walk in 7 days is:

\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers and then determine how many toys the fifth worker must produce to meet the order.

First, let's calculate the production of the first four workers:

- The first two workers produce 6 toys an hour each. Together, they produce \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.
- The next two workers produce 4 toys an hour each. Together, they produce \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.

So, the total production of the first four workers per hour is \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

Since they work for 10 hours, the total production by the first four workers is \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys.

The order requires 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. This means that the first four workers have produced \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

Since the first four workers have produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced the remaining \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked:

\[
\frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys per hour}
\]

Therefore, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour."
"Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog. Since Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds, Elijah's first dog weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog. So, Elijah's second dog weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the total weight of all the dogs, we add the weights of Kory's dog and Elijah's two dogs:

\[ 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is 105 pounds."
"Let's work backwards from the information given:

1. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris originally had \(9 + 7 = 16\) stickers.
2. Luis gave all of his stickers to Kris, so Luis had 16 stickers before giving them to Kris.
3. Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris, so the 16 stickers he had were the other half. Therefore, Luis originally had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.
4. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Seth originally had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

Therefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of M&M that John has:

3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces

Next, we need to find out how many M&M he has in total:

30 ounces * 30 M&M per ounce = 900 M&M

Now, if he puts 10 M&M in each small bag, we can calculate the number of small bags he can make:

900 M&M / 10 M&M per small bag = 90 small bags

Therefore, John can make 90 small bags of M&M."
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we first need to calculate half of the earth's circumference.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:

\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:

\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

"To find out how fast the fastest car goes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use that to find the speed of the fastest car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so we calculate its speed as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times 120 \text{ mph} = 600 \text{ mph} \]

Next, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we calculate the speed of the fastest car as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 \text{ mph} = 750 \text{ mph} \]

Therefore, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour."
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old two years ago. Therefore, Vince is now 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

Vince is now 9 years old."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted.
2. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, Madeline also painted \( A \) eggs.
3. Let \( C \) be the number of eggs Camden painted.
4. Since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, Sarah painted \( 30 - C \) eggs.
5. We are also told that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so \( C = (30 - C) + 12 \).

Now, let's solve for \( C \):

\[ C = 30 - C + 12 \]
\[ 2C = 42 \]
\[ C = 21 \]

So, Camden painted 21 eggs. Now, we know Sarah painted:

\[ 30 - C = 30 - 21 = 9 \]

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs.

Now, we know the total number of eggs painted by Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah is 56. We can write this as:

\[ A + A + C + (30 - C) = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs.

Finally, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:

\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

Final answer: 8"
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Since each group of crayons will be placed in a box, Nik will need 25 boxes.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we calculate the total weight of the boxes:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds."
"First, let's calculate how much of the tree can be turned into logs. John can make logs out of 80% of the 80-foot tree:

\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs can be cut from the 64 feet of usable wood:

\[ \frac{64}{4} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

From each log, John can cut 5 planks. Therefore, the total number of planks he can get from all the logs is:

\[ 16 \times 5 = 80 \text{ planks} \]

If he sells each plank for $1.2, the total amount he makes is:

\[ 80 \times 1.2 = 96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{96} \]"
"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns $5000 per month and this is half of what her brother earns, we can calculate her brother's earnings as follows:

\[ \text{Brother's earnings} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, we need to find the combined salary of Valerie and her brother:

\[ \text{Combined salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so we calculate her earnings as:

\[ \text{Mother's earnings} = 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \]

Now, we can find the total amount of money they all have together by adding their individual earnings:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all have together is:

\[ 45000 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Grandma to walk the entire 3 miles, given the information about her speeds and the time spent on the beach.

1. **Determine the speed on the beach:**
   - Grandma spends 40 minutes walking 2 miles on the beach.
   - Speed on the beach = Distance / Time = 2 miles / (40 minutes / 60 minutes per hour) = 2 / (2/3) = 3 miles per hour.

2. **Determine the speed on the sidewalk:**
   - The speed on the sidewalk is twice the speed on the beach.
   - Speed on the sidewalk = 2 * 3 miles per hour = 6 miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - Distance on the sidewalk = 1 mile.
   - Time on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed = 1 mile / 6 miles per hour = 1/6 hours.
   - Convert this time to minutes: (1/6) * 60 minutes = 10 minutes.

4. **Calculate the total time for the entire walk:**
   - Time on the beach = 40 minutes.
   - Time on the sidewalk = 10 minutes.
   - Total time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

Therefore, it takes Grandma 50 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk."
"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate how much Jane has saved so far.
2. Determine how much more she needs to save to reach $60.
3. Calculate how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining amount.

Step 1: Calculate how much Jane has saved so far.
Jane saves $4 every week. Over 8 weeks, she has saved:
\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 2: Determine how much more she needs to save to reach $60.
The total amount she wants to save is $60. She has already saved $32, so she needs:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 3: Calculate how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining amount.
Since she saves $4 each week, the number of weeks needed to save $28 is:
\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."
"To find the total number of blue birds in the trees, we can break down the problem into parts and then sum the results.

1. For the 3 trees each with 7 blue birds:
   \(3 \times 7 = 21\) blue birds

2. For the 2 trees each with 4 blue birds:
   \(2 \times 4 = 8\) blue birds

3. For the 1 tree with 3 blue birds:
   \(1 \times 3 = 3\) blue birds

Now, we add all these together to get the total number of blue birds:
\(21 + 8 + 3 = 32\)

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob originally has. We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the original number of marbles Bob has:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtract 24 from both sides to solve for the original number of marbles:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} = 60 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Original number of marbles} = 36 \]

Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, we subtract 10 from the original number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 26 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water that would allow Donny to drink the mixture after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle.

Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of \( T \)-degree water into his water bottle, the resulting mixture must be at least 40 degrees for him to drink it.

The total volume of the mixture is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces.

The average temperature of the mixture can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average temperature} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

We know that the average temperature must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiplying both sides by 5:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the mixture.

\[
\boxed{68}
\]"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over the three-week period and then add these to the initial numbers.

1. **Initial number of animals:**
   - Cows: 50
   - Chickens: 20

2. **Number of days in three weeks:**
   - 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

3. **Cows added per day:**
   - 20 cows/day

4. **Total cows added in three weeks:**
   - 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows

5. **Chickens added per day:**
   - 10 chickens/day

6. **Total chickens added in three weeks:**
   - 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

7. **Total number of cows after three weeks:**
   - Initial cows + Cows added = 50 + 420 = 470 cows

8. **Total number of chickens after three weeks:**
   - Initial chickens + Chickens added = 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

9. **Total number of animals on the farm after three weeks:**
   - Total cows + Total chickens = 470 + 230 = 700 animals

**Final numerical answer:**
700"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for 4 packs of bagels before the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times \$10.00 = \$40.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total:
\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels/pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost per bagel by dividing the total cost by the number of bagels:
\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \text{ per bagel} \]

So, the cost per single bagel is:
\[ \$1.00 \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means Gomer ate \(23 - 5 = 18\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

2. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means it takes \(6 - 3 = 3\) potatoes to make \(3 - 1 = 2\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we need to determine how many sets of 2 scoops are in 18 scoops.
   - There are \(18 \div 2 = 9\) sets of 2 scoops in 18 scoops.

4. Since each set of 2 scoops requires 3 potatoes, for 9 sets, we need \(9 \times 3 = 27\) potatoes.

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes."
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs he consumes over the 60 days.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs for the first 30 days is:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs for the next 30 days is:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of eggs consumed over the 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of red jellybeans.
2. Calculate the total number of green and red jellybeans.
3. Subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans to find the number of blue jellybeans.

Step 1: Jess can see that there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans. So, the number of red jellybeans is:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Step 2: The total number of green and red jellybeans is:
\[ 17 + 34 = 51 \]

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of passengers:

\[ 5x + 9x = 84 \]

Where \( x \) is the common multiplier for the ratio. Combining the terms, we get:

\[ 14x = 84 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{84}{14} = 6 \]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:

- Number of men: \( 5x = 5 \times 6 = 30 \)
- Number of women: \( 9x = 9 \times 6 = 54 \)

If 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

\[ 54 - 20 = 34 \]

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day.
2. Calculate the number of sunflowers sold in 3 days.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day.**

- Faraday earns $26 per day from selling individual sunflowers.
- Each sunflower is sold for $2.
- Therefore, the number of individual sunflowers sold per day is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \).

**Step 2: Calculate the number of sunflowers sold in 3 days.**

- Since Faraday sells 13 sunflowers per day, in 3 days, he would sell \( 13 \times 3 = 39 \) sunflowers.

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Since each rock costs $5, we divide $100 by $5:

\[ \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Adam can buy 20 rocks.

Next, we need to find out how many rocks he sells. He sells 60% of his inventory, so we calculate 60% of 20:

\[ 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \]

Adam sells 12 rocks.

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling these 12 rocks. Each rock is sold for $7, so:

\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \]

Adam earns $84 from selling the rocks.

To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to subtract the revenue from the initial investment. Adam's initial investment is $100, and his revenue is $84, so the loss is:

\[ 100 - 84 = 16 \]

Therefore, Adam loses $16."
"To determine how many days it will take Lauren to create all the picture scenes, we need to calculate the total number of days required for each size of picture scene and then sum these values.

1. **Large-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for large-sized scenes is \( \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) days.

2. **Medium-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for medium-sized scenes is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) days.

3. **Small-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for small-sized scenes is \( \frac{49}{7} = 7 \) days.

Now, we sum the days required for each type of picture scene:
\[ 9 \text{ days} + 6 \text{ days} + 7 \text{ days} = 22 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Lauren 22 days to create all of the picture scenes."

The average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to first determine the probability of winning for the second ticket.

Given:
- The probability of winning the first ticket is 20%, or 0.20.
- The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket.

So, the probability of winning the second ticket is \(3 \times 0.20 = 0.60\), or 60%.

The probability that both tickets are winners is the product of the individual probabilities of winning each ticket, assuming the events are independent.

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is:
\[0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12\]

Expressed as a percentage, this is:
\[0.12 \times 100 = 12\%\]

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"First, let's determine how many seashells Carlos collected. We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, Carlos collected:

\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \text{ seashells} \]

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. Therefore, Carrey collected:

\[ \frac{22}{2} = 11 \text{ seashells} \]

Now, we can find the total number of seashells collected by adding the seashells collected by each person:

\[ 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \text{ seashells} \]

They decided to divide all the seashells equally among themselves. Since there are 3 people, each person will get:

\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ seashells} \]

So, each person gets 20 seashells."

5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes

The total cassette time is 13 minutes."
"Linus buys each mobile device for $20. He sells each for twice the original price, which means he sells each for $20 * 2 = $40.

First, let's calculate the profit from selling one device:
Profit per device = Selling price - Buying price = $40 - $20 = $20.

Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, so in total, he bought 2 + 4 = 6 devices.

The total profit from selling all 6 devices is:
Total profit = Profit per device * Number of devices = $20 * 6 = $120.

Therefore, Linus was able to earn a profit of $120 after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday."
"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall and Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel. So, Ned's height is:

\[ 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so Carl's height is:

\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet} \]

Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so the length of Carl's cane is:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is 3 feet."
"To satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required based on the information given.

1. Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
2. Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required would be:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles they need to produce, we subtract the current production from the total required:
\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce an additional 7300 bottles of juice to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people."
"First, let's determine the number of octuplets dressed in each color. Since Carla has 8 identical octuplets:

- 3/4 of them are dressed in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \) octuplets.
- 1/4 of them are dressed in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \) octuplets.

Next, we need to find out how many of the blue-wearers and purple-wearers also wear bows:

- All 2 blue-wearers wear bows.
- 1/3 of the 6 purple-wearers wear bows: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) octuplets.

Now, we have a total of \( 2 + 2 = 4 \) octuplets wearing bows. Out of these, 2 are wearing purple and 2 are wearing blue.

To find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we use the formula for conditional probability:

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearing bow wearers}}{\text{Total number of bow wearers}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{2}{4} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 50%."

So, the IRS received 1125 tax reports on Wednesday."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
2. He sells half of it for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.
3. After selling 40 square meters, he has 40 square meters left.
4. He then sells another 1/4 of his remaining land for $30. One quarter of 40 square meters is 10 square meters. So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.
5. After these two sales, he has 30 square meters left (40 - 10 = 30).
6. He sells the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter. So, he earns 30 * $3 = $90 from the last sale.

Now, let's add up all the money he earned:
- First sale: $50
- Second sale: $30
- Third sale: $90

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $90 = $170

Therefore, Abraham will be able to earn $170 after selling all his unused land."
"To find Geb's age, we start by calculating half of Haley's age and then subtract 10 from that value.

Haley's age = 26 years

Half of Haley's age = 26 / 2 = 13 years

"Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. If he goes out three times a day, the number of face masks he uses per day is:

\[ 2 \text{ masks/go} \times 3 \text{ go/day} = 6 \text{ masks/day} \]

For 2 days, the total number of face masks he uses is:

\[ 6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks} \]

Therefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen equals 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei: \(5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\) eggs.

To find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs hidden: \(36 - 27 = 9\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
9 eggs are still hidden in the yard."
"First, let's calculate the number of apartments in the third complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have \(200 + 200 = 400\) apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than this combined total, so it has \(400 + 0.60 \times 400 = 400 + 240 = 640\) apartments.

Now, let's calculate the total number of apartments John collects from all three complexes:
- First complex: 200 apartments
- Second complex: 200 apartments
- Third complex: 640 apartments

Total apartments = \(200 + 200 + 640 = 1040\) apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, so the total number of collections per week is:
\[1040 \times 3 = 3120\] collections.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so the total amount of money he makes in a week is:
\[3120 \times 0.40 = 1248\] dollars.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[1248\]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **5-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. Let's denote the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces as \(x\). So, the 8-year-old tree produces \(x - 200\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old avocado tree**: Doesn't produce any fruit, so it produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we need to find the value of \(x\) (the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces). According to the problem, the 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than the 10-year-old tree, so:
\[x - 200 = 350\]
\[x = 350 + 200\]
\[x = 550\]

So, a 10-year-old tree produces 550 fruits.

Now, let's sum up the total number of fruits produced over the 10 years:
\[50 + 150 + 350 + 0 + 550 + 1000 = 2200\]

Therefore, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 2200."
"Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100, which is $20.

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters, and the length of the red rope as \( R \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we can express \( Y \) in terms of \( B \) using the second relationship:
\[ Y = B + 7 \]

Now, we substitute \( R \) and \( Y \) in terms of \( B \) into the third equation:
\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 5 \]

Now, we can find \( R \) using the first relationship:
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters."
"First, let's determine how much money Rissa was given. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars. According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, Rissa gave $3 to her little sister. Since Ronnie gave the same amount to his little sister, he also gave $3. Therefore, the amount of money left with Ronnie is:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Given that the mural uses 12 pints of paint in total and that half of the mural is yellow, we can determine the amount of yellow paint used:

\[ \text{Amount of yellow paint} = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Since the mural has equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, and the total amount of paint used for these three colors is the remaining half of the mural:

\[ \text{Total amount of red, white, and purple paint} = 12 - 6 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we divide the total amount of these three colors by 3:

\[ \text{Amount of red paint} = \frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, the number of pints of red paint used is:

2 pints"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is:

\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total area of the house is:

\[ 3160 \text{ square feet} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cloud puffs Alice counts each day and then sum them up for the five days.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
2. **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Monday, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the puffs from all five days:
\[3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93\]

At the end of the week, Alice will have counted a total of 93 cloud puffs."
"First, let's determine the number of pods in the special size box. The regular box contains 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods. 

To find 20% of 100:
\[ 100 \times 0.20 = 20 \]

So, the special size box contains:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. To find the cost per pod in the special size box:
\[ \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

If you have $1, you can buy:
\[ \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \text{ pods} \]

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run:
\[ 10 \text{ dishwashing cycles} \]

"First, let's determine how many 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdraws. Since he withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we divide $1000 by $20:

\[ \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \]

So, Thomas initially has 50 twenty-dollar bills.

Next, Thomas loses 10 of these bills while getting home. Therefore, the number of bills he has left is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Thomas then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, he uses 20 twenty-dollar bills to pay for a bill, leaving him with:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Thomas then triples his money. Since he has 20 twenty-dollar bills, the total amount of money he has is:

\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \]

Tripling this amount gives:

\[ 400 \times 3 = 1200 \]

Finally, Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"In the first half:
- Team A scores 4 goals.
- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, which is 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half:
- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals.
- Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, which is 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

Total number of goals scored in the match:
- Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
- Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

Total goals = 6 (Team A) + 10 (Team B) = 16 goals

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the length of the chalk after Monday.
2. Calculate how much chalk is used each day.
3. Determine how many days the chalk will last before it needs to be recycled.

**Step 1: Determine the length of the chalk after Monday.**

The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk and used 45% of it on Monday. So, the remaining chalk is:
\[ 5 \times (1 - 0.45) = 5 \times 0.55 = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]

**Step 2: Calculate how much chalk is used each day.**

The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. So, the amount of chalk used each day is:
\[ 0.20 \times \text{current length of chalk} \]

**Step 3: Determine how many days the chalk will last before it needs to be recycled.**

We need to find out how many days it will take for the chalk to be reduced to 2 inches or less. We can do this by iteratively subtracting the daily usage from the current length of the chalk until it is 2 inches or less.

Let's start with 2.75 inches and subtract 20% each day:

- **Day 1:**
  \[ 2.75 - 0.20 \times 2.75 = 2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20 \text{ inches} \]

- **Day 2:**
  \[ 2.20 - 0.20 \times 2.20 = 2.20 - 0.44 = 1.76 \text{ inches} \]

Since 1.76 inches is less than 2 inches, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk on the second day.

Therefore, the teacher has \(\boxed{2}\) days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk."
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to calculate the number of boys and girls on varsity and then subtract these from the total number of boys and girls.

1. Calculate the number of girls on varsity:
   - One-third of the girls are on varsity.
   - Number of girls on varsity = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \).

2. Calculate the number of boys on varsity:
   - One-fourth of the boys are on varsity.
   - Number of boys on varsity = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \).

3. Calculate the total number of students on varsity:
   - Total students on varsity = Number of girls on varsity + Number of boys on varsity = \( 4 + 3 = 7 \).

4. Calculate the total number of students not on varsity:
   - Total students not on varsity = Total number of students - Total number of students on varsity.
   - Total number of students = 12 boys + 12 girls = 24.
   - Total students not on varsity = \( 24 - 7 = 17 \).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of teeth drilled:**
   - The dentist drills 4 teeth.

2. **Determine the number of teeth capped:**
   - The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills.
   - Therefore, the number of teeth capped = 4 (drilled) + 7 = 11 teeth.

3. **Calculate the total number of teeth fixed:**
   - Teeth fixed = Teeth drilled + Teeth capped = 4 + 11 = 15 teeth.

4. **Calculate the percentage of teeth fixed:**
   - Total teeth = 30
   - Teeth fixed = 15
   - Percentage of teeth fixed = (Teeth fixed / Total teeth) * 100
   - Percentage of teeth fixed = (15 / 30) * 100 = 0.5 * 100 = 50%

The final numerical answer is 50%."
"First, we need to calculate the total amount of milk that passed the expiry date. Mr. Marcellus purchased 4000 gallons of milk, and 2/5 of this amount was spoiled.

\[ \text{Spoiled milk} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we calculate the refund amount based on the cost per gallon, which is $3.5.

\[ \text{Refund} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$5600 \]

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of \(\$5600\)."
"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 5(C + 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7) \]

Next, we'll solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}C + \frac{35}{3} \]
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

Final answer: Colin is 20 years old."
"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school gets.

First, we know that Bob can buy 100 books for $500. To find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy with $27000, we divide $27000 by $500:

\[ \frac{27000}{500} = 54 \]

This means Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books. Since each set is 100 books, the total number of books he can buy is:

\[ 54 \times 100 = 5400 \]

Now, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school gets:

\[ \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \]

So, Bob can buy 1800 books per school.

"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices and pepperoni pizza slices that Kate's friends will eat.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

So, for 6 friends, the total number of slices eaten will be:
- Cheese pizza slices: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices}\)
- Pepperoni pizza slices: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices}\)

Now, we need to determine how many whole cheese and pepperoni pizzas are required to provide these slices.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- To find out how many cheese pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of cheese slices by the number of slices per pizza: \(36 \text{ slices} \div 12 \text{ slices per pizza} = 3 \text{ pizzas}\)

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- To find out how many pepperoni pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of pepperoni slices by the number of slices per pizza: \(24 \text{ slices} \div 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 3 \text{ pizzas}\)

Therefore, Kate needs to buy a total of:
- 3 cheese pizzas
- 3 pepperoni pizzas

So, the total number of pizza pies she needs to buy is \(3 + 3 = 6\).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Snowballs Built Per Hour**: Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour.

2. **Snowballs Melted Per 15 Minutes**: 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 fifteen-minute intervals in an hour, the net loss of snowballs per hour is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) snowballs.

3. **Net Gain of Snowballs Per Hour**: Therefore, the net gain of snowballs per hour is \(20 - 8 = 12\) snowballs.

4. **Target Number of Snowballs**: Jay wants to have 60 snowballs.

5. **Time Calculation**: To find out how many hours it will take to get 60 snowballs, we divide the target number of snowballs by the net gain per hour:
   \[
   \text{Time (in hours)} = \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Jim's age at the time Digimon came out and then find out how old he is now.

1. First, we need to find out how many years ago Digimon came out. Since John is 28 now and he was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out, we can set up the following relationship:

Let \( J \) be Jim's age when Digimon came out, and \( 2J \) be John's age at that time. Since John is 28 now, the number of years since Digimon came out is \( 28 - 2J \).

2. We know that John was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out, so we can write the equation:
\[ 2J = 28 - (28 - 2J) \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 2J = 28 - 28 + 2J \]
\[ 2J = 2J \]
This equation is true for any \( J \), but we need to use the relationship between their ages at the time Digimon came out. Since John was twice as old as Jim, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2J = 28 - (28 - 2J) \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 2J = 28 - 28 + 2J \]
\[ 2J = 28 - 2J \]
\[ 4J = 28 \]
\[ J = 7 \]

So, Jim was 7 years old when Digimon came out. Since it has been 20 years since then, we can find Jim's current age by adding 20 years to his age at that time:
\[ 7 + 20 = 27 \]

Therefore, Jim is currently 27 years old.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - The nurses used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the first day, they had \(50 - 38 = 12\) bandages left.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - At the end of the second day, they had \(12 - 28 = -16\) bandages, but since they can't have a negative number of bandages, this means they needed to order more bandages to cover the deficit. They ordered another bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the second day, they had \(50 - 16 = 34\) bandages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they added \(50 \times 2 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the third day, they had \(34 + 100 - 25 = 109\) bandages.

However, the problem states that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means we need to adjust our calculation to match this condition. Let's denote the initial number of bandages they started with as \(x\).

- After the first day, they had \(x + 50 - 38 = x + 12\) bandages.
- After the second day, they had \(x + 12 + 50 - 28 = x + 34\) bandages.
- After the third day, they had \(x + 34 + 100 - 25 = x + 109\) bandages.

Since they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, we can set up the equation:
\[x + 109 = 78\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[x = 78 - 109 = -31\]

This negative value indicates an error in the interpretation. Let's recheck the steps with the correct interpretation:

- After the first day, they had \(x + 12\) bandages.
- After the second day, they had \(x + 34\) bandages.
- After the third day, they had \(x + 109 - 25 = x + 84\) bandages.

Setting up the correct equation:
\[x + 84 = 78\]
\[x = 78 - 84 = -6\]

This still seems incorrect. Let's recheck the problem statement and the steps:

- They had 78 bandages left, so the correct equation should be:
\[x + 109 - 25 = 78\]
\[x + 84 = 78\]
\[x = 78 - 84 = -6\]

The correct interpretation should be:
\[x + 109 - 25 = 78\]
\[x + 84 = 78\]
\[x = 78 - 84 = -6\]

The correct initial number of bandages they started with is:
\[x = 109 - 84 = 25\]

So, the initial number of bandages they started with is:

"To determine the total cost of May's hair cut and color, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut and the cost of the color separately, and then add them together.

1. **Cost of the color**: The cost for the color is a flat rate of $40.

2. **Cost of the haircut**: The cost per inch of haircut is $30. May's hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, which means her hair was cut by 2 inches. Therefore, the cost of the haircut is \(2 \text{ inches} \times \$30/\text{inch} = \$60\).

3. **Total cost**: Adding the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut gives us \( \$40 + \$60 = \$100 \).

So, the total cost of May's cut and color is $100."
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days Jen works in April.
2. Calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate.
3. Add the additional $10 for complete attendance.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of days Jen works in April.**
Since April has exactly 4 weeks and Jen works 6 days a week, the total number of days she works in April is:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ days} \]

**Step 2: Calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate.**
Jen's hourly rate is $1.5, and she works 7.5 hours a day. Therefore, her daily earnings are:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$11.25/\text{day} \]
For 24 days, her total earnings are:
\[ 24 \text{ days} \times \$11.25/\text{day} = \$270 \]

**Step 3: Add the additional $10 for complete attendance.**
Since Jen did not incur any absences, she receives the additional $10 for complete attendance. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:
\[ \$270 + \$10 = \$280 \]

**Final Answer:**
\$280"
"To calculate how much money Jason earned, we need to multiply the number of times he performed each task by the amount he earns for that task and then sum these amounts.

1. For emptying the dishwasher: $0.50 per time, and he did it 6 times.
   \[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]

2. For doing his laundry: $3.00 per time, and he did it once.
   \[ 1 \times 3.00 = 3.00 \]

3. For cleaning his room: $1.50 per time, and he did it once.
   \[ 1 \times 1.50 = 1.50 \]

4. For taking the trash to the curb: $0.75 per time, and he did it twice.
   \[ 2 \times 0.75 = 1.50 \]

Now, we add all these amounts together to find the total amount Jason earned:
\[ 3.00 + 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 = 9.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 9.00 \]"
"Each whale has 40 gallons of blood. A shark has three times as much blood as a whale, so a shark has:

\[ 40 \text{ gallons} \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

If we have ten sharks, the total amount of blood for ten sharks would be:

\[ 120 \text{ gallons/shark} \times 10 \text{ sharks} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

1200 gallons"
"To calculate the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up the number of people who entered at different times.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant, which is 3 * 50 = 150 people.

Now, we add all these numbers together:

50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) + 80 (after 10:00) + 150 (evening) = 320

The total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack contains 5 pens, the total number of red pens is:

\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

She also bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. Therefore, the number of black pens is:

\[ 2 \times 25 \text{ red pens} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

To find the total number of pens, we add the number of red pens and black pens together:

\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

Alain has 75 pens."
"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so:

\[ \text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

The cost of cognac per bottle is 50% more than the cost of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + (0.5 \times 60) = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the cognac:

\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount spent:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2400} \]"
"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted:
- 20 White Oak trees
- Twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees

On the second day, he planted:
- 10 more White Oak trees than the first day, which is \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees
- \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days:
- Total White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\)
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: \(40 + 50 = 90\)

Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:
\[50 + 90 = 140\]

140"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Fred initially made 24 gallons of root beer.
2. His children drank 4 gallons, leaving 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.
3. His wife spilled 7 gallons, leaving 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.
4. His friend Ronnie took 5 gallons, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people (including Fred) showed up for the party. The remaining root beer is 8 gallons, which will be shared equally among the 3 people.

To find out how much each person gets, we divide the remaining root beer by the number of people:

8 gallons / 3 people = 8/3 gallons per person

So, each person gets 8/3 gallons of root beer, which is approximately 2.67 gallons.

The final numerical answer is:
8/3 gallons or approximately 2.67 gallons per person."
"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \( 8 \).

The final numerical answer is:
8"
"First, let's find out how many fish have red stripes. One-third of the 66 fish have red stripes:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after removing the fish with red stripes:

\[ 66 - 22 = 44 \]

Now, we know that 5/11 of the remaining 44 fish have blue stripes:

\[ \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \]

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

To find the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes to the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[ 22 + 20 = 42 \]

Therefore, the total number of fish that have red stripes and blue stripes is 42."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Amy originally had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so that's \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
2. She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so that's \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.
3. In total, before any theft or usage, Amy had \(8 + 18 = 26\) eyeshadow colors.

Now, let's account for the changes:

4. Her sister steals one of the palettes, which had 4 colors. So, \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors left.
5. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each set has 6 colors, half of that is \(6 / 2 = 3\) colors. So, she uses 3 colors from one set, leaving \(18 - 3 = 15\) colors from that set.
6. Adding the remaining colors from the other two sets, we have \(15 + 4 = 19\) colors from the makeup sets.
7. Adding the remaining palette, we have \(19 + 4 = 22\) colors in total.

So, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is 22."
"Mattison is 60 inches tall.

The height of the two-story house is 7 times Mattison's height:
\[ 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The floor to ceiling height on the first floor is thrice Mattison's height:
\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we subtract the first floor's ceiling height from the total height of the house:
\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:
\[ 240 \text{ inches} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many shells team Alphas found. Since they found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ 700 \times 0.40 = 280 \]

This means team Alphas found 280 shells. Now, we need to find out how many shells were left for the other two teams:

\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ 420 \times 0.60 = 252 \]

So, team The finders found 252 shells. To find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells:

\[ 420 - 252 = 168 \]

Therefore, team Gogetters found 168 shells. 

168"
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

First, let's calculate the total miles that all four dogs need to walk per day based on the average:

\[ \text{Average miles per day} = 3 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Number of dogs} = 4 \]
\[ \text{Total miles for all dogs} = \text{Average miles per day} \times \text{Number of dogs} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the miles needed for the first three dogs:
- First dog: 1 mile
- Second dog: 4 miles
- Third dog: 3 miles

Adding these up gives:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles needed for all four dogs:
\[ \text{Miles for the last dog} = \text{Total miles for all dogs} - \text{Total miles for the first three dogs} = 12 - 8 = 4 \text{ miles} \]

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day."
"First, we calculate the amount of the loan John gets by taking 40% of the value of his house:

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, we determine how much of the loan he uses to pay off his debts by taking 60% of the loan amount:

\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Finally, we subtract the amount used to pay debts from the total loan amount to find out how much money he has leftover:

\[ \text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the amount of money John has leftover after paying his debts is $40,000."
"To find out how much Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught. 

The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms, the second tuna weighs 46 kilograms, and the last tuna weighs 26 kilograms. Adding these weights together:

\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings from selling 128 kilograms of tuna at a rate of $0.50 per kilogram:

\[ 128 \times 0.50 = 64 \]

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To find Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines. She sells them at 11/8 of the price she bought them for. Given that she bought the magazines at $72, we can calculate the selling price as follows:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11 \times 72}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{792}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the buying price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed = 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much as the low setting, so it removes 2 liters per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed = 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.

3. **High Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much as the medium setting, so it removes 4 liters per day.
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed = 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Now, we sum the water removed at each setting:
- Total water removed = 3 liters (low) + 6 liters (medium) + 20 liters (high) = 29 liters.

The total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."
"To find out how many balloons Jolene and her friends threw, we first need to calculate the total number of balloons they started with and then subtract the number of balloons left at the end of the afternoon.

1. Calculate the total number of balloons:
   - They filled up 10 packs of balloons, with 30 balloons per pack.
   - Total balloons = 10 packs * 30 balloons/pack = 300 balloons.

2. Calculate the number of balloons thrown:
   - By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons were left.
   - Balloons thrown = Total balloons - Balloons left
   - Balloons thrown = 300 - 12 = 288 balloons.

Therefore, they threw 288 balloons."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how much of the second medicine Saanvi used. The second medicine is 3 times the amount of the first medicine. Since the first medicine is 14 mL, the second medicine would be \(3 \times 14 = 42\) mL.

2. Now, we add the amounts of both medicines to find the total amount of medicine for one dose:
   \[
   14 \, \text{mL} + 42 \, \text{mL} = 56 \, \text{mL}
   \]

3. To find the total amount of medicine for 8 doses, we multiply the amount for one dose by 8:
   \[
   56 \, \text{mL} \times 8 = 448 \, \text{mL}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is 448 mL."
"First, let's determine the capacity of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, we can calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[ \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:

\[ \text{Total capacity of John's school} = 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, we know that Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students. Therefore, the total capacity of both schools combined is:

\[ \text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students} \]

The combined capacity of both schools is 150 students."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen will owe his sister including the 2% interest.

The principal amount Stephen borrowed is $300. The interest is 2% of $300, which is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen will owe is:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} = 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 each month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in 11 months is:

\[ \text{Total Paid in 11 Months} = 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he has already paid from the total amount he owes:

\[ \text{Amount to be Paid in the Twelfth Month} = 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month."
"First, let's calculate the total number of diaper changes needed per day for both children. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day and there are 2 children, the total number of diaper changes is:

\[ 5 \text{ changes/child/day} \times 2 \text{ children} = 10 \text{ changes/day} \]

Jordan's wife changes half of these diaper changes. Therefore, the number of diaper changes she handles is:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ changes/day}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes/day} \]

Since the total number of changes is 10 and Jordan's wife handles 5, the remaining changes are handled by Jordan. Thus, the number of diaper changes Jordan does per day is:

\[ 10 \text{ changes/day} - 5 \text{ changes/day} = 5 \text{ changes/day} \]

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day."
"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the jar.
2. Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans, considering the packing efficiency.
3. Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.
4. Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans.
5. Compare Tim's guess to the true number of red jelly beans.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.**

The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall. The volume \( V \) of the jar is:
\[ V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans.**

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume \( V_{\text{eff}} \) is:
\[ V_{\text{eff}} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 3: Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.**

Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches. The total number of jelly beans \( N \) that can fit in the jar is:
\[ N = \frac{V_{\text{eff}}}{\text{volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans.**

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red. Therefore, the estimated number of red jelly beans \( N_{\text{red}} \) is:
\[ N_{\text{red}} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

**Step 5: Compare Tim's guess to the true number of red jelly beans.**

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between Tim's guess and the true number is:
\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

Therefore, Tim's guess was 36 jelly beans off."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the bus had 20 people on board.
2. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the number of people on the bus is now \(20 + 40 = 60\).
3. At the second stop, \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the 40 people who entered at the first stop entered again. So, \( \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \) people entered the bus. Now, the number of people on the bus is \(60 + 30 = 90\).
4. At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the number of people on the bus is now \(90 \times 2 = 180\).

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find out how many more people are needed to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the current number of people on the bus from the bus's capacity:

\[200 - 180 = 20\]

Therefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 20."
"First, let's calculate the total number of visits Pauline made in the first 5 years. Since she visits the museum three times a year, the total number of visits in 5 years is:

\[ 3 \text{ visits/year} \times 5 \text{ years} = 15 \text{ visits} \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of one visit after the increase. The original cost of one visit is $2, and it increased by 150%. An increase of 150% means the cost is multiplied by 2.5 (since 150% is 1.5 times the original cost, and the original cost is 1, so 1 + 1.5 = 2.5):

\[ 2 \times 2.5 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Pauline continued to visit the museum for 3 more years at the new cost. The number of visits in these 3 years is:

\[ 3 \text{ visits/year} \times 3 \text{ years} = 9 \text{ visits} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 9 visits at the new price:

\[ 9 \text{ visits} \times 5 \text{ dollars/visit} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the visits in the first 5 years to the cost of the visits in the next 3 years. The cost for the first 5 years is:

\[ 15 \text{ visits} \times 2 \text{ dollars/visit} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is:

\[ 30 \text{ dollars} + 45 \text{ dollars} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 75 \]"
"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students who can try the escape room.
2. Determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed.
3. Calculate the total time required for all groups to try the escape room.

First, we know that there are 10 students in each of the 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th) who can try the escape room. So, the total number of students is:
\[ 10 \text{ students/grade} \times 4 \text{ grades} = 40 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed from these 40 students:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students/group}} = 5 \text{ groups} \]

Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room. Therefore, the total time required for all groups to try the escape room is:
\[ 5 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 225 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is:
\[ 225 \text{ minutes} \]"
"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the wooden tables and the roof frames separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the wooden tables:
- John made 4 wooden tables.
- Each table costs $20.
- Therefore, the total cost for the wooden tables is \(4 \times 20 = 80\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the roof frames:
- John made 2 roof frames.
- Each roof frame costs $10.
- Therefore, the total cost for the roof frames is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the wooden tables and the roof frames to find the total amount Ali has to pay:
- Total cost for wooden tables: $80
- Total cost for roof frames: $20
- Therefore, the total amount Ali has to pay is \(80 + 20 = 100\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:
100"
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we calculate its length as:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning he will need, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of ground beef needed:**
   - Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef.
   - He wants to make 80 meatballs.
   - Therefore, the amount of ground beef needed is \( \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds of ground beef} \).

2. **Calculate the amount of seasoning needed:**
   - Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for every pound of ground beef.
   - Since he needs 5 pounds of ground beef, the amount of seasoning needed is \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \).

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning to make 80 meatballs."
"First, we calculate the total width of the windows. Since there are five windows and each is 35 inches wide, the total width is:

\[ 5 \times 35 = 175 \text{ inches} \]

Luke needs fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. Therefore, the amount of fabric he should buy is:

\[ 2 \times 175 = 350 \text{ inches} \]

So, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining minutes.

1. For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute:
   \[
   16 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.25/\text{minute} = \$4.00
   \]

2. For the remaining minutes (36 - 16 = 20 minutes), the cost is $0.20 per minute:
   \[
   20 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.20/\text{minute} = \$4.00

Therefore, the amount of rain on Tuesday will be 5 inches."
"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly makes as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be written as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

The total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is the sum of the number of cupcakes and brownies:
\[ C + B \]

Each of the five people in the class gets two treats, so the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]

Adding 2 to both sides:
\[ 4C = 12 \]

Dividing both sides by 4:
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To calculate the total cost for Karen, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted price for both a manicure and a pedicure.
2. Calculate the cost of adding nail art to all 20 nails (10 on each hand).
3. Add the discounted price of the services to the cost of the nail art.

**Step 1: Calculate the discounted price for both a manicure and a pedicure.**

- The original price for a manicure is $35.
- The original price for a pedicure is $40.
- The discount is 20%, so the discount amount for each service is 20% of the original price.

Discount for manicure: \( 35 \times 0.20 = 7 \)
Discounted price for manicure: \( 35 - 7 = 28 \)

Discount for pedicure: \( 40 \times 0.20 = 8 \)
Discounted price for pedicure: \( 40 - 8 = 32 \)

Total discounted price for both services: \( 28 + 32 = 60 \)

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of adding nail art to all 20 nails.**

- The cost of nail art per nail is $3.
- Karen has 20 nails (10 on each hand).

Total cost for nail art: \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \)

**Step 3: Add the discounted price of the services to the cost of the nail art.**

Total cost: \( 60 + 60 = 120 \)

Therefore, Karen would pay a total of $120."
"To find out how many magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the total number of issues from each magazine and then sum them up.

1. For the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year each:
   \[3 \times 12 = 36\] issues per year.

2. For the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
   \[6\] issues per year.

3. For the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
   \[4 \times 6 = 24\] issues per year.

Now, we sum up all the issues:
\[36 + 6 + 24 = 66\] issues per year.

However, the question asks for the total number of magazines she gets every year, not the total number of issues. We need to count the number of magazines, not the issues.

So, we have:
- 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year each.
- 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year.
- 1 magazine that sends 24 issues a year.

Therefore, the total number of magazines Susan gets every year is:
\[3 + 1 + 1 = 5\]

Final numerical answer:

"Given that Samantha has 27 paintings and she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, we can determine the number of paintings Shelley has by adding 12 to Samantha's total:

\[ \text{Shelley's paintings} = 27 + 12 = 39 \]

Next, since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, we can find the number of paintings Kim has by subtracting 8 from Shelley's total:

\[ \text{Kim's paintings} = 39 - 8 = 31 \]

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings."
"To find the final price of the toy after the changes in November, December, and January, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the price in December after an 80% increase:**
   - Original price in November: $40
   - Increase: 80% of $40 = 0.80 * $40 = $32
   - Price in December: $40 + $32 = $72

2. **Calculate the price in January after a 50% decrease:**
   - Price in December: $72
   - Decrease: 50% of $72 = 0.50 * $72 = $36
   - Price in January: $72 - $36 = $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"First, let's calculate the amount Charlie makes from the 4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour.

\[ 4 \text{ lessons} \times \$80 \text{ per lesson} = \$320 \]

Next, we need to determine the reduced rate for lessons with a veteran. Since the rate is reduced by 25%, we calculate 25% of $80 and subtract it from the standard rate.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$80 = 0.25 \times \$80 = \$20 \]

So, the reduced rate is:

\[ \$80 - \$20 = \$60 \]

Now, we calculate the amount Charlie makes from the 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran at the reduced rate.

\[ 2 \text{ lessons} \times \$60 \text{ per lesson} = \$120 \]

Finally, we add the amounts from both types of lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make for the day.

\[ \$320 + \$120 = \$440 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is:

\[ \$440 \]"

"Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had. 

To find out how many pomelos she has left, we calculate 1/4 of 20:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]

So, Eve is left with 5 pomelos. To find out how many pomelos she gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Eve gave away 15 pomelos."
"First, let's calculate how many apples Walter ate. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 apples:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, let's find out how many apples he had left after eating:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Next, Walter gave 25% of the remaining apples to his sister. To find out how many apples that is, we calculate 25% of 36:

\[ 0.25 \times 36 = 9 \]

So, Walter gave 9 apples to his sister. Now, let's find out how many apples he had left after giving some to his sister:

\[ 36 - 9 = 27 \]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple:

\[ 27 \times 3 = 81 \]

Therefore, Walter received $81."
"To find out how many novels Regina has written this year, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( x \) be the number of novels Regina has written this year. According to the problem, 9 novels are 3 quarters (or \(\frac{3}{4}\)) of the number of novels she has written this year. This can be written as:

\[
9 = \frac{3}{4}x
\]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \(\frac{4}{3}\):

\[
x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3}

"To find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days. Since Michael travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we need to know how many hours he travels in 3 days. Assuming he travels 24 hours a day (excluding stops), the total travel time in 3 days is:

\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the total distance Michael travels in 72 hours:

\[ 72 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ km/hr} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the 6000 km distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered. We use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance Covered}}{\text{Total Distance}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 0.6 \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

"First, let's calculate the number of grapes Madeline's brother used to make the grape juice. Since he used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, and Madeline ate 6 grapes, we have:

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many grapes were used to make the pies. Since the recipe calls for 12 grapes per pie and their mother made 4 pies, we have:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

Now, we can find the total number of grapes used by adding the grapes used for the juice and the pies:

\[ 30 + 48 = 78 \text{ grapes} \]

Since these 78 grapes are the total used, and this is the amount that was left after Madeline ate her 6 grapes, we can find the initial number of grapes by adding the grapes Madeline ate to the grapes used for the juice and pies:

\[ 78 + 6 = 84 \text{ grapes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To calculate how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, let's break down the costs:

1. **Pasta cost per week**: $1.00
2. **Cheddar cheese cost per week**: $3.00
3. **Gruyere cheese cost per week**: Twice the cheddar cheese cost, which is $3.00 * 2 = $6.00

Now, let's add up the weekly costs:
- Total weekly cost = Pasta cost + Cheddar cheese cost + Gruyere cheese cost
- Total weekly cost = $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, we need to multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year (52 weeks):
- Annual cost = Total weekly cost * 52
- Annual cost = $10.00 * 52 = $520.00

Therefore, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year."
"To determine the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.
2. Determine the total available time in minutes for the custodian over 5 days.
3. Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.
4. Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.**

Time per classroom = 15 minutes
Number of classrooms = 80

Total time required = 15 minutes/classroom * 80 classrooms = 1200 minutes

**Step 2: Determine the total available time in minutes for the custodian over 5 days.**

Working hours per day = 8 hours
Minutes per hour = 60

Total available time per day = 8 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/day

Total available time over 5 days = 480 minutes/day * 5 days = 2400 minutes

**Step 3: Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.**

Total time required = 1200 minutes
Total available time over 5 days = 2400 minutes

Average time spent cleaning per day = 1200 minutes / 5 days = 240 minutes/day

**Step 4: Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.**

Average time spent cleaning per day = 240 minutes
Total available time per day = 480 minutes

Percentage of the day spent cleaning = (240 minutes / 480 minutes) * 100% = 50%

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:

- The middle 2 shelves together can hold \(10 + 10 = 20\) books.
- Adding the bottom and top shelves, the total capacity of one bookcase is \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's determine how many eggs Rose has in total. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's calculate how much Rose will earn by selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs. Therefore, the number of sets of 3 eggs in 60 eggs is:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since she earns $1 for each set of 3 eggs, her total earnings will be:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Rose's profit is:

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. So, we can write:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \( 96 \)."

"To solve this, let's break down the time taken for each side of the Rubik's cube:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice the time of the first side, so each takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. The last two sides each take half the time of the first side, so each takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.
4. The sixth side is not specified, but since the problem states ""once you get the 5th side you have all 6 sides,"" we can assume the sixth side is included in the total time.

1. Calculate the number of boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of boxes.

First, we know that Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks and each box contains 8 popsicle sticks. We can find out how many boxes he needs by dividing the total number of popsicle sticks by the number of popsicle sticks per box:

\[ \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{56 \text{ popsicle sticks}}{8 \text{ popsicle sticks/box}} = 7 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we know that each box costs $2.00. Therefore, the total cost for 7 boxes is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 7 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$14.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"The main phone plan costs $20, and it costs twice as much as each additional phone. Therefore, each additional phone costs $20 / 2 = $10.

Since there are five phones in total and one of them is the main phone, there are 4 additional phones. The cost for the additional phones is 4 * $10 = $40.

The total cost of the phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones, which is $20 + $40 = $60.

Therefore, the whole phone plan costs $60."
"To calculate how much money Derrick makes in June from selling all the doughnuts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in a day.
2. Determine the number of days in June.
3. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
4. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts in June.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in a day.
Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since 1 dozen equals 12 doughnuts, the total number of doughnuts made in a day is:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ doughnuts} \]

Step 2: Determine the number of days in June.
June has 30 days.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
\[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

Step 4: Calculate the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts in June.
Derrick sells each doughnut for $2. Therefore, the total revenue is:
\[ 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \times \$2/\text{doughnut} = \$7200 \]

Therefore, Derrick makes \(\$7200\) in June if he sells all the doughnuts."
"Jade takes 7 photos in one batch and uploads 6 batches each day. So, the number of photos she uploads each day is:

\[ 7 \text{ photos/batch} \times 6 \text{ batches/day} = 42 \text{ photos/day} \]

She has a total of 210 photos to upload. To find out how many days she will need to upload all her photos, we divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads each day:

\[ \frac{210 \text{ photos}}{42 \text{ photos/day}} = 5 \text{ days} \]

So, Jade will need 5 days to upload all of her photos."
"To calculate the total amount Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks, we need to first determine the cost for one week and then multiply that by 5.

1. Cost for blouses in one week: \(5 \text{ blouses} \times \$5.00 = \$25.00\)
2. Cost for pants in one week: \(2 \text{ pairs of pants} \times \$8.00 = \$16.00\)
3. Cost for skirts in one week: \(1 \text{ skirt} \times \$6.00 = \$6.00\)

Now, we add these amounts to find the total cost for one week:
\[
\$25.00 + \$16.00 + \$6.00 = \$47.00
\]

Next, we multiply the weekly cost by 5 to find the total cost for 5 weeks:
\[
\$47.00 \times 5 = \$235.00
\]

Therefore, Alicia spends \(\$235.00\) on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed after training. His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster:

\[ 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of words John needs to speak. Each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages:

\[ 450 \, \text{words/page} \times 10 \, \text{pages} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we can calculate the time it would take for John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. The time is calculated by dividing the total number of words by his speaking speed:

\[ \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speed."
"On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day, so:
50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so:
2 * 70 = 140 people.

For the rest of the week (days 4, 5, 6, and 7), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Since there are 4 days, the total number of people he saw over these days is:
4 * 60 = 240 people.

Now, to find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we add the number of people from each day:
50 (first day) + 70 (second day) + 140 (third day) + 240 (remaining days) = 500 people.

Therefore, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:
500."
"Let's break down the popping process step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds:** 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds:** The popping rate triples, so \(20 \times 3 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Following 30 seconds:** The popping rate quadruples, so \(20 \times 4 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds:** The popping rate is halved from the previous 30 seconds, so \(80 \div 2 = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, we add up the number of kernels that popped in the first four 30-second intervals:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\]

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop. So, a quarter of 40 kernels pop:
\[40 \div 4 = 10\]

Adding these to the total number of popped kernels:
\[200 + 10 = 210\]

Therefore, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:
\[210\]"
"To determine how many lemons Tim will need, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount of lemonade needed:**
   - Tim needs 4 gallons for the party.
   - Allen asked for an extra gallon that is twice as tart, which means it will have the same amount of lemon juice as a regular gallon but will be more concentrated.
   - Therefore, Tim needs 4 gallons + 1 gallon = 5 gallons of lemonade in total.

2. **Determine the amount of lemon juice needed:**
   - For 1 gallon of lemonade, Tim needs 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.
   - For 5 gallons, he will need 5 cups of lemon juice.

3. **Calculate the number of lemons needed:**
   - 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
   - Therefore, to get 5 cups of juice, Tim will need 5 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 30 lemons.

So, Tim will need 30 lemons in total."
"To find out how much dog food the Kennel house will need in a week, we first calculate the daily consumption for each breed and then extend that to a week.

   - 10 animals × 2 legs/animal = 20 legs

2. Calculate the total number of legs from the 4-legged animals:
   - 15 animals × 4 legs/animal = 60 legs

3. Add the legs from both types of animals to get the total number of legs:
   - 20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

4. Divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the number of pairs:
   - 80 legs ÷ 2 = 40 pairs

The total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 40."
"Let's break down the information given:

- There are 4 blue blocks.
- There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, so there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) yellow blocks.
- Let the number of red blocks be \(R\).

The total number of blocks in the tower is the sum of blue, yellow, and red blocks, which is given as 32. So, we can write the equation:

\[4 + 8 + R = 32\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[12 + R = 32\]

To find \(R\), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:

\[R = 32 - 12\]

\[R = 20\]

So, there are 20 red blocks in the tower.

Elvis is now 54 miles from his house."
"To find the boat's value after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and apply it to the boat's value step by step.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - Initial value: $9000
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Value after first year: \( 9000 \times (1 - 0.30) = 9000 \times 0.70 = 6300 \)

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the second year: $6300
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Value after second year: \( 6300 \times (1 - 0.30) = 6300 \times 0.70 = 4410 \)

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the third year: $4410
   - Depreciation rate: 20%
   - Value after third year: \( 4410 \times (1 - 0.20) = 4410 \times 0.80 = 3528 \)

After three years, the boat is worth $3528."
"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to determine the quantities of the other colored candies.

1. **Red Candies**: There are 54 red candies.
2. **Orange Candies**: There are twice as many orange candies as red candies, so:
   \[
   2 \times 54 = 108 \text{ orange candies}
   \]
3. **Yellow Candies**: There are half as many yellow candies as red candies, so:
   \[
   \frac{54}{2} = 27 \text{ yellow candies}
   \]

Now, we add up the red, orange, and yellow candies to find out how many candies are not pink:
\[
54 + 108 + 27 = 189 \text{ candies}
\]

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the number of non-pink candies from the total:
\[
232 - 189 = 43

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the daily feed consumption for one pig:**
   Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day. So, the daily feed consumption for one pig is:
   \[
   4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the daily feed consumption for all five pigs:**
   Since Dexter has five pigs, the total daily feed consumption is:
   \[
   8 \text{ pounds/day/pig} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weekly feed consumption for all five pigs:**
   There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly feed consumption is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of hot dogs needed for the party. John invited 20 people, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. So, the total number of hot dogs required is:

\[ 20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many more hot dogs John needs to buy, considering he already has 4 hot dogs left over. The number of additional hot dogs needed is:

\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Since each pack contains 6 hot dogs, the number of packs required is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pack costs $2, so the total cost for 6 packs is:

\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs."

   - The original price of each T-shirt is $8.
   - For the first T-shirt, the cost is $8.
   - For the second T-shirt, the cost is 50% of $8, which is $4.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

2. **Shoes:**
   - The shoes are 40% off the original price.
   - The original price of the shoes is $40.
   - The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is $16.
   - Therefore, the cost of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - The total amount Jake spends is the sum of the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes.
   - Total cost = $12 (T-shirts) + $24 (shoes) = $36.

The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36."
"First, let's calculate how much money Ryan has earned from his allowance over 3 weeks. Since he earns $6 each week, over 3 weeks he earns:

\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ryan uses some of this money to buy ice cream cones for himself and his 3 friends. Each ice cream cone costs $1.25, so the total cost for 4 ice cream cones is:

\[ 1.25 \times 4 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the ice cream from his total allowance, we find out how much money Ryan has left:

\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, Ryan wants to buy movie tickets for himself and his 3 friends. Each movie ticket costs $6.50, so the total cost for 4 movie tickets is:

\[ 6.50 \times 4 = 26 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Ryan only has $13 left, he cannot afford to buy 4 movie tickets. To find out how many movie tickets he can buy, we divide the amount of money he has by the cost of one movie ticket:

\[ \frac{13}{6.50} = 2 \]

Therefore, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets. 

Final numerical answer:

"To find out how much Ellen and Lani spent in all, we need to add up the costs of all the items they bought.

First, let's calculate the total amount Ellen spent:
- Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100.
- Ellen also bought a photo frame for $5.
So, Ellen's total is $100 + $5 = $105.

Next, let's calculate the total amount Lani spent:
- Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30.
- Lani also bought two bathrobes, each costing $100, so the total for the bathrobes is $100 + $100 = $200.
So, Lani's total is $30 + $200 = $230.

Now, we add Ellen's total and Lani's total to find the overall amount spent:
- Ellen's total: $105
- Lani's total: $230
So, the total amount spent by both is $105 + $230 = $335.

Therefore, Ellen and Lani spent a total of $335."
"To calculate the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of the honey and jam mix, we need to first determine the cost of ingredients for one jar and then calculate the total cost and revenue for 10 jars.

**Cost of ingredients for one jar:**

- Passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20

Total cost for one jar = $12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44

**Revenue from selling one jar:**

- Selling price of one jar = $50

**Profit from one jar:**

- Profit = Revenue - Cost = $50 - $44 = $6

**Profit from 10 jars:**

- Total profit = Profit per jar * Number of jars = $6 * 10 = $60

**Final numerical answer:**

$60"
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to convert each type of coin to its dollar value and then sum these values.

1. **Quarters**: Each quarter is worth $0.25. Justin has 32 quarters.
   \[
   32 \times 0.25 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth $0.10. Justin has 95 dimes.
   \[
   95 \times 0.10 = 9.50 \text{ dollars}

"Josh is open 5 days a week (Monday through Saturday). In 2 weeks, he would be open for \(5 \times 2 = 10\) days. He services 3 cars a day, so in 2 weeks, he services \(3 \times 10 = 30\) cars. Since he gets paid $4 per car, his total earnings in 2 weeks would be \(30 \times 4 = 120\).

Therefore, Josh makes $120 in 2 weeks."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, Randy has:
   - 9 oatmeal cookies
   - 4 chocolate chip cookies
   - 5 sugar cookies

2. Randy ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor:
   - Oatmeal: 9 - 1 = 8
   - Chocolate chip: 4 - 1 = 3
   - Sugar: 5 - 1 = 4

3. He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
   - Oatmeal: 8 - 2 = 6

4. He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
   - Sugar: 4 - 2 = 2

5. He bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner:
   - Oatmeal: 6 + 4 = 10
   - Chocolate chip: 3 + 4 = 7
   - Sugar: 2 + 4 = 6

Now, let's add up the total number of cookies Randy has:
- Oatmeal: 10
- Chocolate chip: 7
- Sugar: 6

Total cookies = 10 + 7 + 6 = 23

"Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers. He would sell half of them at $5 each and the other half at $7 each.

Half of 12 is 6, so he would sell 6 toy soldiers at $5 each and 6 toy soldiers at $7 each.

The money earned from selling 6 toy soldiers at $5 each is:
6 * $5 = $30

The money earned from selling 6 toy soldiers at $7 each is:
6 * $7 = $42

The total money earned would be:
$30 + $42 = $72

Matthew would earn $72."
"First, let's calculate the total number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \, \text{holes/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 84 \, \text{holes} \]

When Nate gets home, he starts filling holes at a rate of 9 holes a day, but the dog continues to dig 6 new holes each night. This means that each day, the net change in the number of holes is:

\[ 9 \, \text{holes filled} - 6 \, \text{holes dug} = 3 \, \text{holes filled per day} \]

To find out how many days it takes to fill in all 84 holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled per day:

\[ \frac{84 \, \text{holes}}{3 \, \text{holes/day}} = 28 \, \text{days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} = 4 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes."
"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School, and Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 \]

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = 3000 \]

Now, to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract the average enrollment of Butler High School from that of Norman High School:

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 4000 - 3000 \]

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 1000 \]

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School."
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made: 7995
Rainbow cookies: 2595
Oatmeal cookies: 3075

Now, let's subtract the rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total:

7995 - 2595 - 3075 = 2325

So, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which is \(16 / 2 = 8\) test tubes.
2. Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, which is \(14 + 2 = 16\) Petri dishes.
3. Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, but some were lost, so let's denote the number of beakers Igor actually brought as \(x\).
4. The total number of items on the lab bench is 29.

We can set up the equation for the total number of items:

\[8 \text{ (test tubes)} + x \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[8 + x + 16 = 29\]

\[24 + x = 29\]

Subtract 24 from both sides:

\[x = 5\]

So, Igor brought 5 beakers to the lab bench. Since Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, the number of beakers Igor lost is:

\[7 - 5 = 2\]

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of legs for all tables:**
   - Each table has 4 legs.
   - James is putting together 4 tables.
   - Therefore, the total number of legs is \(4 \text{ legs/table} \times 4 \text{ tables} = 16 \text{ legs}\).

2. **Calculate the total number of screws needed:**
   - Each leg needs 2 screws.
   - Therefore, the total number of screws needed is \(16 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 32 \text{ screws}\).

3. **Calculate the number of screws left over:**
   - James has 40 screws.
   - He needs 32 screws.

"First, let's determine how much each person raised:

- Alexandra raises $430.
- Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.
- Sarah raises $300.
- Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add up the amounts raised by all of them:

- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: $750
- Maryam: $700
- Sarah: $300

Total amount raised = $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180

Therefore, the total amount of money they all raised is $2180."
"First, let's determine the speed of Aaron and Vanessa. Since Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, if we let \( V \) be Vanessa's speed in miles per minute, then Aaron's speed would be \( \frac{V}{2} \).

Given that Vanessa ran 4 miles, we can calculate the time it took her to complete her part of the race. Since speed is distance divided by time, we can rearrange to find time as distance divided by speed. For Vanessa, the time \( T_V \) is:

\[ T_V = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{V} \]

We know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron ran half the distance that Vanessa did (2 miles), we can use his speed to find \( V \):

\[ \text{Aaron's speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Since Aaron's speed is \( \frac{V}{2} \), we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{V}{2} = \frac{1}{8} \]

Solving for \( V \):

\[ V = \frac{1}{8} \times 2 = \frac{1}{4} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, we can find the time it took Vanessa to run 4 miles:

\[ T_V = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{4} \text{ miles per minute}} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"To determine how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line needed for the 200 feet of dock.
2. Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total needed.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of line needed.
Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total line needed is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Step 2: Subtract the amount of line he already has.
He already has 6 feet of new line, so the amount he needs to buy is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, he needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."

"First, let's calculate the cost price of each watermelon. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = \$1.60 \]

Next, we need to find the selling price per watermelon, given that the vendor made a profit of 25%. The profit percentage is calculated on the cost price, so the selling price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = \text{Cost price per watermelon} \times (1 + \text{Profit percentage}) \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times (1 + 0.25) \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 1.25 \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00."
"First, let's determine Dora's current age. If Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

James is twice as old as Dora, so James is currently 9 * 2 = 18 years old.

John had James when he was 19, so John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

John had his youngest son when he was 32, so his youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many oranges each person can peel in an hour and then find the difference.

First, let's determine how many oranges Ana can peel in an hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

Next, let's determine how many oranges Jane can peel in an hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- Ana peels 20 oranges.
- Jane peels 15 oranges.
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost is $400, and he gets it at 80% off, which means he pays 20% of the original cost.

\[ \text{Discounted cost of radiator} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

\[ \text{Cost of labor} = 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of labor to find the total amount Mark paid.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of equations. Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( 2C + 4K = 70 \) (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To eliminate \( C \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know there are 15 cows, we can substitute \( K \) back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, there are 5 chickens.

Final numerical answer:

"First, we need to determine the total number of pizza slices available. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices as follows:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends. This means the slices need to be divided among 4 people:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices of pizza."
