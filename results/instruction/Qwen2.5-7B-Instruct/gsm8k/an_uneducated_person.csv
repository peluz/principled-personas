"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for muffins, so she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs per day.

The number of eggs left to sell is 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

She sells each egg for $2, so the money she makes from selling the eggs is 9 * $2 = $18.

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

"First, we need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. An increase of 150% means the value increased by 1.5 times the original value.

So, the increase in value due to repairs is:
\[ 80,000 \times 1.5 = 120,000 \]

Adding this increase to the original value gives us the new value of the house:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost Josh incurred. This includes the purchase price and the cost of repairs:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, the profit Josh made is:
\[ 70,000 \]"
"James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, each day he runs:

3 sprints/day * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters/day

Since he runs 3 times a week, the total distance he runs in a week is:

180 meters/day * 3 days/week = 540 meters/week

540 meters/week"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of feed Wendi's chickens need in a day. Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed, and she has 20 chickens. So, the total feed needed is:

\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we know that Wendi gives 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. So, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:

\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:

\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of 16 glasses, considering that every second glass is 60% of the price of the first glass.

1. The cost of the first glass is $5.
2. The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = $3\).

This pattern continues, so for every pair of glasses, the total cost is $5 (first glass) + $3 (second glass) = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide 16 by 2 to find out how many pairs of glasses there are: \(16 \div 2 = 8\) pairs.

Now, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost of each pair: \(8 \times 8 = $64\).

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

64"
"If Seattle has 20 sheep, then Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So, Charleston has:

\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ sheep} \]

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, Toulouse has:

\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ sheep} \]

Now, to find the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together, we add the number of sheep each city has:

\[ 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 \]

So, the total number of sheep is 260."
"First, let's calculate how long it would normally take to download the file without any interruptions.

The file size is 200 GB, and Carla can download at a rate of 2 GB/minute.

To find out how long it would take to download the entire file:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{File Size}}{\text{Download Rate}} = \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's break down the process with the interruptions:

1. **First 40% of the file:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 80 \text{ GB} \).
   - Time to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute is \( \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Restart due to Windows update:**
   - This takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the download from the beginning:**
   - The download starts again from 0 GB, so it needs to download the full 200 GB.
   - Time to download 200 GB at 2 GB/minute is \( \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \).

Adding all these times together:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 160 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time to download the file, including the restart, is 160 minutes."
"First, let's calculate the distance John initially travels to the point where he turns around. He drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

So, John is 180 miles away from home when he turns around.

Next, we need to calculate how far he travels back towards home in the 4 hours he spends trying to get home. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time.

Then, he drives for 30 minutes (0.5 hours) at 30 mph.

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After that, he drives for the remaining 1.5 hours (since 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours) at 80 mph.

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we add the distances he covered while driving back towards home.

\[ \text{Total distance covered} = 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Since he initially was 180 miles away from home, we subtract the distance he covered from his initial distance to find out how far he is from home at the end of those 4 hours.

\[ \text{Distance from home} = 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

So, at the end of those 4 hours, John is 45 miles from home."
"First, we calculate Eliza's regular pay for the first 40 hours. Her regular rate is $10 per hour.

Regular pay for 40 hours = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

Next, we calculate her overtime pay. She worked 5 hours of overtime (45 total hours - 40 regular hours = 5 overtime hours). Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate.

Overtime rate = 1.2 * $10/hour = $12/hour

Overtime pay for 5 hours = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Now, we add her regular pay and her overtime pay to find her total earnings for the week.

Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay
Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460

Eliza's earnings for this week are $460."
"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ downloads} \]

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, so the downloads were 70% of the second month's downloads:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \text{ downloads} \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

The total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then add them together.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Each dozen costs $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Each dozen costs $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Each dozen costs $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330.

Now, we add the costs together to get the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit becomes positive.

First, let's break down the costs and revenues:

1. **Initial Cost**: $90 (cost to plant the tree)
2. **Annual Costs**: $3 (water and feed the tree)
3. **Annual Revenue**: 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5

Now, let's calculate the net profit each year:

- Net profit per year = Annual Revenue - Annual Costs = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5

To find out how many years it will take to cover the initial cost of $90, we divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:

- Number of years to cover initial cost = Initial Cost / Net Profit per Year = $90 / $7.5 = 12

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

12"
"Let's work backwards from the information given.

1. Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house.
2. Before selling at the orange house, she had twice as many vacuum cleaners as she has now, because she sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, before the orange house, she had \(5 \times 2 = 10\) vacuum cleaners.
3. Before selling 2 more to the red house, she had \(10 + 2 = 12\) vacuum cleaners.
4. The 12 vacuum cleaners represent two-thirds of what she started with, because she sold a third at the green house and then 2 more to the red house, leaving her with two-thirds. So, if 12 is two-thirds, then one-third is \(12 \div 2 = 6\). Therefore, she started with \(6 \times 3 = 18\) vacuum cleaners.

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners."
"First, let's find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we calculate:

20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students

So, 4 students are enrolled in contemporary dance. This leaves us with:

20 - 4 = 16 students

Next, 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance. So, we calculate:

25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

This means 4 students are enrolled in jazz dance. Now, we subtract the number of students enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students to find out how many are enrolled in hip-hop dance:

16 - 4 = 12 students

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and then multiply by 100:

(12 / 20) * 100 = 0.6 * 100 = 60%

So, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the profit from each purchase option after the market increase.

1. **Jewelry Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value after increase: $5,000 + ($5,000 * 2.5%) = $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125
   - Profit from jewelry: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

2. **Electronic Gadgets Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value after increase: $8,000 + ($8,000 * 1.2%) = $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096
   - Profit from electronic gadgets: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit, and the profit would be $125.

**Final Answer:**
$125"
"Each train travels 80 miles westward and then 150 miles northward. 

For the first day, the distance covered by each train is 80 miles.
For the second day, the distance covered by each train is 150 miles.

So, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is:
80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles

The final numerical answer is:
230 miles"
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to find out how much she earns from teaching and coaching separately, and then add those amounts together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She earns $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
\[ 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} = 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- She earns $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
\[ 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours/week} = 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from coaching are:
\[ 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Finally, we add her annual earnings from teaching and coaching to get her total annual salary:
\[ 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} + 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} = 57500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Her annual salary is:
\[ 57500 \, \text{dollars} \]"
"Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every day. There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she will eat:

3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week

In 4 weeks, she will eat:

21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the number of dozens of eggs she will eat in 4 weeks is:

84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens

So, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks."
"First, let's calculate the total time Marissa has to complete the hike to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles. To find the total time required to hike at an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So,

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 2 hours (1 hour for the first 4 miles and another hour for the next 2 miles) on the trail. Therefore, the remaining time she has to complete the hike is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance to be covered is:

\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

So,

\[ \text{Required speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour."
"First, let's calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink before any is spilled. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, we calculate:

\[ \text{Water in orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters} \]

After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the remaining volume is 9 liters. The amount of water in the remaining orange drink is:

\[ \text{Water in remaining orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, we calculate:

\[ \text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the water from the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink to find the total amount of water in the 24 liters:

\[ \text{Total water} = 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Samantha is currently 31 years old. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old now.

Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to subtract the age Raymond was when he had his son from Raymond's current age.

So, 25 (Raymond's current age) - 23 (age when Raymond had his son) = 2 years.

Raymond's son was born 2 years ago."
"Billy sold DVDs to his first 3 customers, and each bought 1 DVD. So, that's 3 DVDs. Then, he sold DVDs to his next 2 customers, and each bought 2 DVDs. So, that's 2 * 2 = 4 DVDs. The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs. 

To find the total number of DVDs sold, we add the DVDs sold to the first 3 customers and the next 2 customers: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday."
"The candle burns for 4 hours from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Since it melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we can calculate the total melting as follows:

2 centimeters/hour * 4 hours = 8 centimeters

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM."
"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that the price Kyle paid ($19.50) is 75% of the original price (since he got a 25% discount).

Let's denote the original price as \( P \).

Given that \( 75\% \) of \( P \) is $19.50, we can write the equation as:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's do the division:
\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples.

- Chicken meal: $12
- 5 packs of milk: 5 * $3 = $15
- 4 apples: 4 * $1.50 = $6

Now, let's add these amounts together to find the total cost of these items:

$12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Marie paid a total of $50. To find out how much she spent on the boxes of pizza, we subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount paid:

$50 - $33 = $17

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of one box of pizza:

$17 ÷ $8.50 = 2

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

2"
"To find out how much Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the total cost for each type of item and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the shorts:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
- Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
- So, the total cost for the shorts is \(3 \times 16.50 = 49.50\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
- So, the total cost for the pants is \(3 \times 22.50 = 67.50\) dollars.

Then, let's calculate the total cost for the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.
- So, the total cost for the shoes is \(3 \times 42 = 126\) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs for the shorts, pants, and shoes to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost for shorts: $49.50
- Total cost for pants: $67.50
- Total cost for shoes: $126

So, the total amount spent is \(49.50 + 67.50 + 126 = 243\) dollars.

Therefore, Mishka spent \(\boxed{243}\) dollars on all the clothing items."
"Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. Over 60 days, she will consume 60 servings of ice cream.

Each carton contains 15 servings and costs $4.00. To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Since each carton costs $4.00, the total cost for 4 cartons is:

\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00/\text{carton} = \$16.00 \]

After 60 days, Cynthia will spend \(\boxed{16}\) dollars on ice cream."
"Henry's total trip is 60 miles. He stopped after 20 miles, so he had 60 - 20 = 40 miles left to travel. His second stop was 15 miles before the end, which means he had 15 miles left to travel when he made his second stop. Therefore, the distance between his first and second stops is 40 - 15 = 25 miles.

25 miles"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the cost of the boots be \( B \) dollars.
2. The cost of one pair of high heels is $33.
3. The cost of the other pair of high heels is twice as much as the first pair, so it is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.
4. Together, the two pairs of high heels cost \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.
5. According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels cost five dollars less than the boots. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   99 = B - 5
   \]
6. To find the cost of the boots, we solve the equation for \( B \):
   \[
   B = 99 + 5 = 104
   \]

So, the cost of the boots is \(\boxed{104}\) dollars."
"To solve this, we first need to find out Darrell's and Allen's current ages based on the given ratio and total age.

The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11. This means for every 7 parts of Darrell's age, Allen's age is 11 parts. Together, these parts make up their total age.

Let's denote Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The sum of their ages is given as 162. So, we can write the equation:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we can find Allen's current age by substituting \(x\) back into the expression for Allen's age:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

Allen's current age is 99. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

So, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"First, let's find out how many jelly beans each friend guessed.

1. The first friend guessed 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guessed 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guessed 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of guesses, which is 3.

240 / 3 = 80.

The average guess is 80."
"John spends 0.5 hours a day on each dog. With 10 dogs, he spends 0.5 * 10 = 5 hours a day. There are 7 days in a week, so he spends 5 * 7 = 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs. 

35"
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

According to the problem, Gretchen has 110 coins in total, so:
\[ S + G = 110 \]

It is also given that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, so:
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now, we can find the number of gold coins by substituting \( S \) back into the equation \( G = S + 30 \):
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins."
"First, let's find out how many jewels Aaron has. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of Raymond's jewels would be 40 / 2 = 20 jewels. Aaron has 5 more jewels than this, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Now, Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

So, Siobhan has 23 jewels."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points that is, we calculate 25% of 4 points:

25% of 4 points = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 points + 1 point = 5 points.

To find the total points scored, we add the points from both halves of the game:

4 points + 5 points = 9 points

Total points scored: 9"
"Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Over 30 days, he will eat:

2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts

The yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00. To find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:

60 yogurts / 4 yogurts/set = 15 sets

Each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, so for 15 sets:

15 sets * $5.00/set = $75.00

Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"John sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he earns 13 * $15 = $195.

He buys 8 video games for $20 each, which costs 8 * $20 = $160.

After buying the video games, he has $5 left, so the total amount he spent on video games and the remaining money is $160 + $5 = $165.

Since he earned $195 from selling the lego sets, and he spent $165, he should have $195 - $165 = $30 left.

Since he has $30 left and each lego set was sold for $15, he still has $30 / $15 = 2 lego sets.

Therefore, John still has 2 lego sets."
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his average speed. Speed is calculated as the total distance divided by the total time.

First, let's find out how many miles John runs each day:
- On the first day, he runs 3 hours. Let's assume he runs at a constant speed \( v \) miles per hour. So, the distance he runs on the first day is \( 3v \) miles.
- On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, so each of those days he runs \( \frac{3v}{2} \) miles.

Now, let's calculate the total distance he runs in a week:
- Total distance = Distance on the first day + Distance on the second day + Distance on the third day
- Total distance = \( 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2} \)
- Total distance = \( 3v + 3v \)
- Total distance = \( 6v \) miles

We know that the total distance he runs in a week is 60 miles, so:
- \( 6v = 60 \)
- \( v = \frac{60}{6} \)
- \( v = 10 \) miles per hour

So, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour."
"First, let's determine Dana's running and walking speeds based on her skipping speed.

Given:
- Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
- Her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed.

So, her running speed is:
\[ 3 \text{ mph} \times 2 = 6 \text{ mph} \]

Next, we know her running speed is four times her walking speed. Therefore, her walking speed is:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ mph}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \]

Now, let's calculate the time she spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking in a six-hour period.

Time spent running:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Time spent walking:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the distance she covers while running and walking.

Distance running:
\[ 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Distance walking:
\[ 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances to find the total distance she can travel in six hours:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ 18 \text{ miles} \]"
"Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.

Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, so Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, so Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

Final numerical answer: 8"
"When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the gold javelin three times farther than usual. Normally, she can throw the javelin for 400 feet. With the gemstone, she can throw it three times that distance.

First, calculate the throwing distance with the gemstone:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we need to determine the difference between the throwing distance and the dragon's reach:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

200 feet"
"Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces. So, the total number of pie pieces is:

5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces:

40 pieces - 14 pieces = 26 pieces

So, the guests took 26 pieces of pie."
"First, let's figure out how many calories are in the whole bag of chips. Since the bag has 5 servings and each serving has 250 calories, the total calories in the bag are:

\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to determine how many more calories you can consume to reach your daily target of 2000 calories. Since you have already consumed 1800 calories, the remaining calories you can consume are:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to find out how many grams of chips you can eat with 200 calories. Since the entire bag (300g) has 1250 calories, the number of grams per calorie is:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{1250 \text{ calories}} = 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} \]

To find out how many grams you can eat with 200 calories, we multiply the number of calories you can still consume by the grams per calorie:

\[ 200 \text{ calories} \times 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips."
"First, let's determine how many pounds of beeswax Charlie needs to make 20 candles. Since he can make 10 candles per pound of beeswax, we divide the total number of candles by 10:

20 candles / 10 candles per pound = 2 pounds of beeswax

Next, we calculate the cost of the beeswax and wicks. Since one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00, for 2 pounds, the cost is:

2 pounds * $10.00 per pound = $20.00

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:

20 candles * $2.00 per candle = $40.00

To find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

$40.00 (revenue) - $20.00 (cost) = $20.00

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is $20.00."
"First, let's calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
\[ 5 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \right) = 5 + 2 = 7 \]

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[ 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \]

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:
\[ 26 \times 4 = 104 \]

Total number of hours spent writing articles in the three days: 104."
"Candice started with 80 post-it notes. She used 220 post-it notes at work and had 23 left over. To find out how many post-it notes were in the package she purchased, we need to calculate the total number of post-it notes she used and had left, and then subtract the ones she originally had.

First, we add the post-it notes she used and the ones she had left:
220 (used) + 23 (left) = 243

Then, we subtract the ones she originally had:
243 - 80 = 163

So, the package she purchased contained 163 post-it notes.

163"
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost per blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties and the total cost of the red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{800}

"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, a 4-foot long wire is:

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we need to find out how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from 48 inches of wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:

48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"First, let's calculate the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, the total number of units is:

15 floors * 8 units/floor = 120 units

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we calculate:

120 units * 3/4 = 90 units

Now, to find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the occupied units from the total units:

120 units - 90 units = 30 units

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"First, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs Lloyd produces per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

252 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 21 dozen eggs per day

Next, we calculate how much Lloyd makes per day by selling the eggs. He sells the eggs for $2 per dozen:

21 dozen eggs per day * $2 per dozen = $42 per day

To find out how much Lloyd makes in a week, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7):

$42 per day * 7 days per week = $294 per week

So, Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week."
"Tom's ship travels back at a rate of 6 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes him to get back, we need to know the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM.

Since the problem does not specify the distance, let's assume he traveled a distance of \(D\) miles from 1 to 4 PM. The time it takes to travel back can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Given that the speed is 6 miles per hour, the time to travel back is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{D}{6} \]

Without the specific distance \(D\), we can't provide a numerical answer. However, if we assume the distance \(D\) is the same as the distance traveled from 1 to 4 PM, and if we know that in 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM) he traveled \(3 \times 10 = 30\) miles, then the time to travel back would be:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{30}{6} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

But since he only has a 3-hour window to travel back, the answer would be the maximum possible time within that window, which is 3 hours.

So, the time it takes him to get back is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more weight needs to be removed to reach the total of 15 pounds. This can be calculated by subtracting the weight of the comic books from the total weight:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we need to find out how many toys weigh 7.5 pounds. This can be calculated by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day and then find the difference.

**Thursday:**
- Truck tires: 6 tires × $60 per tire = $360
- Car tires: 4 tires × $40 per tire = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

**Friday:**
- Car tires: 12 tires × $40 per tire = $480
- Total revenue on Friday: $480 (since no truck tires were repaired)

**Difference in revenue:**
- Thursday's revenue: $520
- Friday's revenue: $480
- Difference: $520 - $480 = $40

The mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday."
"The Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens from the local animal shelter. Their mother informed them that their two house cats, Patchy and Trixie, have had kittens as well.

First, we need to find out how many kittens Patchy has. The problem states that Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens. Since the adopted kittens are 7, we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

So, Patchy has 21 kittens.

Next, we know that Trixie has had 12 kittens.

Now, we add up all the kittens:

- Adopted kittens: 7
- Patchy's kittens: 21
- Trixie's kittens: 12

Adding these together:

\[ 7 + 21 + 12 = 40 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost of one trip to the movies and then see how many such trips he can afford with his $42.

The cost of one movie ticket is $7 and the cost of popcorn is $7. So, the total cost for one trip to the movies is:
\[ 7 + 7 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine how many times Peter can afford this amount with his $42. We do this by dividing his total money by the cost of one trip:
\[ 42 \div 14 = 3 \]

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times.

"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the maximum weight the bridge can carry.
2. Subtract the weight of the empty truck and the driver from the bridge's weight limit.
3. Divide the remaining weight by the weight of each box to find the maximum number of boxes.

The bridge's weight limit is 5000 pounds. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.

First, we subtract the weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit:
\[ 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each box to find the maximum number of boxes:
\[ \frac{1245}{15} = 83 \]

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 83.

83"
"First, we need to determine the initial cost of the groceries before any additional fees. The final bill includes a 25% fee on the initial cost and an additional $3.00 in delivery fees, plus a $4.00 tip, which totals $40.00.

Let's denote the initial cost of the groceries as \( x \).

The 25% fee on the initial cost is \( 0.25x \).

So, the total cost before the tip is \( x + 0.25x = 1.25x \).

Adding the $3.00 delivery fee and the $4.00 tip, the equation becomes:
\[ 1.25x + 3 + 4 = 40 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 1.25x + 7 = 40 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 1.25x = 33 \]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 1.25:
\[ x = \frac{33}{1.25} = 26.40 \]

So, the initial cost of the groceries is $26.40. Now, we need to find the final price after all the additional fees:
\[ 26.40 + 0.25 \times 26.40 + 3 + 4 = 26.40 + 6.60 + 3 + 4 = 40 \]

Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries is:

- Total oranges: 25
- Bad oranges: 1
- Unripe oranges: 20% of 25 = 0.20 * 25 = 5
- Sour oranges: 2

Now, let's calculate the number of good oranges by subtracting the bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total:

Good oranges = Total oranges - (Bad oranges + Unripe oranges + Sour oranges)
Good oranges = 25 - (1 + 5 + 2)
Good oranges = 25 - 8
Good oranges = 17

So, the number of good oranges is 17."
"Janet first spends $500 on the material and $800 on the jeweler to construct the brooch. So, the total cost for the material and construction is:

$500 + $800 = $1300

Next, she pays 10% of this total amount to get it insured. To find 10% of $1300, we calculate:

10% of $1300 = 0.10 * $1300 = $130

Now, we add the insurance cost to the total cost of the material and construction:

$1300 + $130 = $1430

So, Janet paid a total of $1430."
"After 20 years, Marcy becomes entitled to an additional 5% of the value of the pension per year. The base annual pension is $50,000. 

For the 21st to 30th year, she gets the base pension plus 5% of the base pension. 

5% of $50,000 is calculated as:
\[ 50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500 \]

So, her annual pension after 20 years will be:
\[ 50,000 + 2,500 = 52,500 \]

Therefore, if Marcy quits after 30 years, her annual pension will be $52,500.

"First, let's calculate the amount Aleena pays for the first half of the year. Since the streaming service charges $140 per month, for 6 months, the total cost is:

\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \]

For the second half of the year, the company charges 10% less. So, we need to find 10% of $140 and subtract it from $140:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 140 = 0.10 \times 140 = 14 \]

Therefore, the cost for the second half of the year is:

\[ 140 - 14 = 126 \]

Since the second half of the year also consists of 6 months, the total cost for the second half is:

\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \]

Now, we add the costs of the first half and the second half to get the total amount paid by Aleena for the year:

\[ 840 + 756 = 1596 \]

So, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to determine her car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg). We know that she has driven 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. 

First, we calculate the car's fuel efficiency:
\[ \text{Fuel efficiency} = \frac{\text{Distance driven}}{\text{Gallons of gas used}} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Next, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank of 12 gallons:
\[ \text{Miles on a full tank} = \text{Fuel efficiency} \times \text{Tank capacity} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones without interest:

5 cell phones * $150 each = $750

Now, we need to calculate the interest for each cell phone. Since the interest is 2% for each unit, the interest for one cell phone is:

$150 * 2% = $150 * 0.02 = $3

Since there are five cell phones, the total interest for all of them is:

5 * $3 = $15

So, the total cost including interest is:

$750 (original cost) + $15 (total interest) = $765

Shiela will pay this amount in 3 months with equal monthly payments. Therefore, the monthly payment is:

$765 / 3 months = $255

- Level 1: \(64 \times 2 = 128\) square feet

Now, we sum the square footage of all levels:
\[16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240\]

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[\frac{240}{4} = 60\]

The average square footage of a level is 60 square feet."
"Cecilia has to feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. Since there are 365 days in a year, the first year consists of 365 days. 

To find out how many cups of dog food the puppy will need in the first year, we subtract the 180 days from 365 days:
365 days - 180 days = 185 days

For these 185 days, the puppy will need 1 cup of dog food per day:
185 days * 1 cup/day = 185 cups

Now, we need to find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year. Since one bag contains 110 cups, we divide the total cups needed by the number of cups per bag:
185 cups / 110 cups/bag = 1.6818 bags

Since Cecilia can't buy a fraction of a bag, she will need to buy 2 bags of dog food to have enough for the first year.

2 bags

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
2 bags"
"If Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, and Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, then David does:

\[ \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds of laundry} \]

Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does:

\[ \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds of laundry} \]

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is:

\[ 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

"To find out how much money Vincent saves, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in the two different packages and then determine the savings.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:
- Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
- Total cost: \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15.00 \)

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1.00 each:
- Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
- Total cost: \( 9 \times 1.00 = 9.00 \)

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two options to determine the savings:
- Savings: \( 15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00 \)

Therefore, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price."
"The original cost of the grooming is $100. With a 30% discount, the cost is reduced by 30/100 * $100 = $30.

The grooming cost is $70."
"Each girl got 1/6 of 24 liters of water. So, let's calculate how much water each girl got:

\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they got is:

\[ 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

The boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water distributed is:

\[ 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

The initial amount of water was 24 liters. Therefore, the amount of water left is:

\[ 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

10 liters"
"Charlie started with 10 stickers. He then bought 21 more and received 23 for his birthday. So, the total number of stickers he had before giving any away or using any is:

10 (initial stickers) + 21 (bought) + 23 (birthday gift) = 54 stickers

Next, Charlie gave away 9 stickers and used 28 to decorate a greeting card. So, the total number of stickers he gave away or used is:

9 (given to sister) + 28 (used for card) = 37 stickers

To find out how many stickers Charlie has left, we subtract the total number of stickers he gave away or used from the total number of stickers he had:

54 (total stickers) - 37 (given away or used) = 17 stickers

Charlie has 17 stickers left."
"First, we need to find out how much Alex weighs. Grace weighs 125 pounds. 

To find Alex's weight, we calculate 4 times Grace's weight and then subtract 2 pounds:
\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \]
\[ 500 - 2 = 498 \]

So, Alex weighs 498 pounds.

Now, to find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together:
\[ 125 + 498 = 623 \]

Their combined weights are 623 pounds."
"To find the total number of thorns, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses.
2. Calculate the total number of thorns based on the number of roses.

First, we find the total number of roses. Dan has 3 rose bushes, and each rose bush has 25 roses. So, the total number of roses is:
\[ 3 \text{ rose bushes} \times 25 \text{ roses per bush} = 75 \text{ roses} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of thorns. Each rose has 8 thorns, so the total number of thorns is:
\[ 75 \text{ roses} \times 8 \text{ thorns per rose} = 600 \text{ thorns} \]

Therefore, the total number of thorns is:
\[ 600 \]"
"Let's denote the number of games the team lost as \( L \). According to the problem, the team won 8 more games than they lost, so the number of games they won can be represented as \( L + 8 \).

The total number of games played is 22, which is the sum of the games won and lost. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 2L = 14 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ L = 7 \]

So, the team lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more games than they lost:

\[ L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15 \]

The team won 15 games.

"The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.

The second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang 4 * 3 = 12 times.

The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

In total, the alarm rang 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times.

"Sylvie's initial salary is $600 per month. After 5 years, her salary is increased by 10% of $600. So, her salary after 5 years is:

\[ 600 + (0.10 \times 600) = 600 + 60 = 660 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, her salary increases by 10% every year for the next three years. We need to calculate her salary for each of these years.

After the first year (6 years total):
\[ 660 + (0.10 \times 660) = 660 + 66 = 726 \text{ dollars per month} \]

After the second year (7 years total):
\[ 726 + (0.10 \times 726) = 726 + 72.6 = 798.6 \text{ dollars per month} \]

After the third year (8 years total):
\[ 798.6 + (0.10 \times 798.6) = 798.6 + 79.86 = 878.46 \text{ dollars per month} \]

To find her annual salary, we multiply her monthly salary by 12:
\[ 878.46 \times 12 = 10,541.52 \]

So, her annual salary after three more years of service is:
\[ 10,541.52 \]

"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies."

"First, we need to calculate how much potato salad the children will eat. Since a child will eat half as much as an adult, a child will eat 5 lbs of potato salad (10 lbs / 2 = 5 lbs).

Next, we calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults. There are 20 adults, and each will eat 10 lbs, so the total for adults is 20 * 10 lbs = 200 lbs.

Then, we calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the children. There are 5 children, and each will eat 5 lbs, so the total for children is 5 * 5 lbs = 25 lbs.

Finally, we add the amounts for adults and children to find the total amount of potato salad needed. 200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs.

So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic."
"Cindy has 4 pets.

"To find out how old Jackson is, let's use the information given:

1. James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey. So, Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.
3. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old."
"First, we need to determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, and Lee's current time is 38 seconds, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's current time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to calculate Gerald's new time after his diet improved his speed by 10%. A 10% improvement in speed means his time is reduced by 10%. Therefore, his new time is 90% of his original time:

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = \text{Gerald's original time} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \text{ seconds} \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

So, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in \(\boxed{36}\) seconds."
"Given that the number of dogs is 60, and there are two cats for every dog, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 × Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 × 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we first find the combined number of dogs and cats:

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120
Combined number of dogs and cats = 180

The number of rabbits is twelve less than this combined number:

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

"First, let's find out how many boys there are. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

This means the number of girls is:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. Since 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find out how many girls are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:

\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

So, the number of girls not in the girl scout is 40."
"Harry slept 9 hours.

James slept \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept, so we calculate:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understand the volume loss**: When Freda cooks the canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. This means that the volume of the sauce is half the volume of the tomatoes before cooking.

2. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking**: Since the sauce made is 32 ounces and it is half the volume of the tomatoes before cooking, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking must be \(32 \times 2 = 64\) ounces.

3. **Calculate the number of cans used**: Each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces. To find out how many cans were used, we divide the total volume of tomatoes before cooking by the volume of one can:
   \[
   \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of tomatoes in the cans**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:
   \[
   4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

So, Freda used 12 tomatoes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We start with 30 cars on the motorway.
2. After 15 minutes, some cars drive through the traffic jam.
3. In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through the traffic jam.
4. 5 cars take an exit and don't have to drive through the traffic jam.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in both 15-minute intervals is \( x + 20 \).

Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that actually drove through the traffic jam is the original number of cars minus the 5 that took an exit. This can be expressed as:
\[ 30 - 5 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes plus the 20 cars that drove through in the next 15 minutes equals 25:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

80 potted plants + 18 potted plants = 98 potted plants

Tomorrow, she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family. Since there are 40 ledges, she will give away:

1 potted plant/ledge * 40 ledges = 40 potted plants

Subtracting the potted plants she will give away from her total gives:

98 potted plants - 40 potted plants = 58 potted plants

Mary will remain with 58 potted plants."

"To find out how many minutes it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we can use the information given to set up a simple proportion.

We know that the fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles. We need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles.

First, we calculate the time it takes to cover 1 mile:
\[ \text{Time per mile} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} \]

Then, we use this rate to find the time for 42 miles:
\[ \text{Time for 42 miles} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} \times 42 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we perform the multiplication:
\[ \text{Time for 42 miles} = \frac{10 \times 42}{3} \]
\[ \text{Time for 42 miles} = \frac{420}{3} \]
\[ \text{Time for 42 miles} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

"First, we need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each dimension to get the inner dimensions (subtracting 1 inch from each side of the length, width, and height).

The inner dimensions of one box are:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Next, we calculate the inner volume of one box using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is length × width × height.

The inner volume of one box is:
3 inches × 4 inches × 2 inches = 24 cubic inches

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume of all 3 boxes.

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.
2. This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, so he wanted to bake \( 2x \) cookies.
3. However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4. He then dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \).
5. We know that after dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2x + 15 - 5 = 110

"To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate in total, we need to calculate the number of roll-ups each of them had.

First, let's calculate the number of roll-ups Beatrice had:
- Beatrice's roll-ups were 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- So, the total number of roll-ups Beatrice had is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

Next, let's calculate the number of roll-ups Marcell had:
- Marcell's roll-ups were 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- So, the total number of roll-ups Marcell had is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Now, we add the number of roll-ups each of them had to find the total number of roll-ups:
- Total number of roll-ups = \(48 + 42 = 90\).

To find the average number of roll-ups they ate, we divide the total number of roll-ups by 2 (since there are two people):
- Average number of roll-ups = \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\).

So, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is 45."
"First, we need to determine how many feet Julia rows to reach the shore. Since it took her 64 seconds and she rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, we can calculate the total distance by dividing 64 seconds by 16 seconds and then multiplying by 20 feet.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha originally bought.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She bought ten of these boards at $10 each.
- Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 * $10 = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She bought five of these boards at $16 each.
- Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 * $16 = $80.

So, the total cost of the lumber is:
- $100 (2 x 4 x 10 boards) + $80 (4 x 4 x 10 boards) = $180.

Now, let's calculate the selling price of the lumber.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- The price has gone up by 50%, so the new price is $10 + (50% of $10) = $10 + $5 = $15 each.
- Total selling price for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 * $15 = $150.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- The price has gone up by 50%, so the new price is $16 + (50% of $16) = $16 + $8 = $24 each.
- Total selling price for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 * $24 = $120.

So, the total selling price of the lumber is:
- $150 (2 x 4 x 10 boards) + $120 (4 x 4 x 10 boards) = $270.

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:
- Profit = $270 (selling price) - $180 (cost) = $90.

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of $90."
"Katy uses sugar and water in the ratio of 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total parts used are 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

If the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons, then each part in the ratio represents 120 / 20 = 6 teaspoons.

Since Katy uses 7 parts of sugar, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is 7 * 6 = 42 teaspoons.

"John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children. So, he buys a total of 2 * 3 = 6 pairs of shoes. Each pair of shoes costs $60. Therefore, the total cost is 6 * $60 = $360.

He paid $360."
"On the first day, the customs officer counted 2 containers with 5 vehicles in each. So, the total number of vehicles on the first day is:

2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day:

30 vehicles - 10 vehicles = 20 vehicles

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:

20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

So, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4."
"First, let's find out Adrien's salary four years ago, which is given as $40,000.

Adrien's current salary is 40% more than what he was making four years ago. So, we calculate his current salary as follows:

\[ \text{Adrien's current salary} = 40,000 + (40\% \times 40,000) \]
\[ \text{Adrien's current salary} = 40,000 + (0.40 \times 40,000) \]
\[ \text{Adrien's current salary} = 40,000 + 16,000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's current salary} = 56,000 \]

Now, we know that Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. So, we can find Lylah's salary four years ago as follows:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary four years ago} = \text{Lylah's salary four years ago} + (30\% \times \text{Lylah's salary four years ago}) \]
\[ 40,000 = \text{Lylah's salary four years ago} \times (1 + 0.30) \]
\[ 40,000 = \text{Lylah's salary four years ago} \times 1.30 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years ago} = \frac{40,000}{1.30} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary four years ago} = 30,769.23 \]

Now, Lylah's current salary is 40% more than what she was making four years ago:

\[ \text{Lylah's current salary} = 30,769.23 + (40\% \times 30,769.23) \]
\[ \text{Lylah's current salary} = 30,769.23 + (0.40 \times 30,769.23) \]
\[ \text{Lylah's current salary} = 30,769.23 + 12,307.69 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's current salary} = 43,076.92 \]

Finally, we add Adrien's and Lylah's current salaries to find the total salary they were receiving four years later:

\[ \text{Total salary} = \text{Adrien's current salary} + \text{Lylah's current salary} \]
\[ \text{Total salary} = 56,000 + 43,076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary} = 99,076.92 \]

So, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is $99,076.92."
"Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week. Each pad has 30 sheets of paper.

So, in a week, he uses:
2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, he uses:
60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month."
"Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. Kael brought twice the amount of apples and half the number of oranges than Morisette.

First, let's calculate the number of fruits Kael brought:
- Kael brought twice the number of apples Morisette brought, so Kael brought \(2 \times 5 = 10\) apples.
- Kael brought half the number of oranges Morisette brought, so Kael brought \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) oranges.

Now, let's add up all the fruits:
- Morisette's fruits: \(5 + 8 = 13\)
- Kael's fruits: \(10 + 4 = 14\)

Total fruits: \(13 + 14 = 27\)

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.
4. After using the spoons, she had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as \( x \).

So, the total number of spoons Julia had before using any was:
\[ x + 5 \]

After using 3 spoons, she had:
\[ (x + 5) - 3 = 12 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]
\[ x + 2 = 12 \]
\[ x = 12 - 2 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is 10.

"First, let's find out the cost of each item:

1. Each pepper costs $15.
2. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, so a watermelon costs \(3 \times 15 = 45\) dollars.
3. An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so an orange costs \(45 - 5 = 40\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for Dillon's purchase:

- For 4 watermelons: \(4 \times 45 = 180\) dollars.
- For 20 peppers: \(20 \times 15 = 300\) dollars.
- For 10 oranges: \(10 \times 40 = 400\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost:

\(180 + 300 + 400 = 880\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is 880 dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total time spent by the doctors with the patients in a day. Since the hospital sees 500 people a day and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, the total time spent is:

\[ 500 \text{ patients} \times 24 \text{ minutes/patient} = 12000 \text{ minutes} \]

Convert the total time from minutes to hours:

\[ 12000 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 200 \text{ hours} \]

Next, calculate the total revenue from the patients. The hospital charges $200 an hour to the patients:

\[ 200 \text{ hours} \times \$200/\text{hour} = \$40000 \]

Now, calculate the total cost to the hospital. The doctors charge $150 an hour to the hospital:

\[ 200 \text{ hours} \times \$150/\text{hour} = \$30000 \]

Finally, calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the subs, bags of chips, and cookies.

- The cost of 2 subs at $7.50 each is \(2 \times 7.50 = 15.00\).
- The cost of 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each is \(2 \times 1.50 = 3.00\).
- The cost of 2 cookies at $1.00 each is \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\).

Now, let's add these amounts together to find the total cost before the delivery fee and tip.

- Total cost before delivery fee and tip: \(15.00 + 3.00 + 2.00 = 20.00\).

Next, we need to calculate the 20% delivery fee.

- The delivery fee is \(20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00\).

Now, let's add the delivery fee to the total cost before the tip.

- Total cost with delivery fee: \(20.00 + 4.00 = 24.00\).

3. Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \).

The total number of bees is the sum of queens, baby bees, and worker bees:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 7Q \]

We know the total number of bees is 700:

"Let's work through the problem step by step to find out how many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it.

1. Let's denote the total number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

2. Dave ate 14 fries, so the remaining fries are \( x - 14 \).

3. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries. So, the remaining fries are \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \).

4. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries. The remaining fries are \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).

5. A raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries, so the remaining fries are \( \frac{1}{3} \) of \( x - 30 \), which is \( \frac{x - 30}{3} \).

6. Ants carried off the final french fry, leaving 5 behind. So, the remaining fries are \( \frac{x - 30}{3} - 1 = 5 \).

Now, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x - 30}{3} - 1 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), first add 1 to both sides:
\[ \frac{x - 30}{3} = 6 \]

Next, multiply both sides by 3:
\[ x - 30 = 18 \]

Finally, add 30 to both sides:

1200 inches (rolls) + 720 inches (croissants) + 1440 inches (baguettes) = 3360 inches

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

3360 inches / 12 inches/foot = 280 feet

So, if Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they will be 280 feet long."
"To find out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas required by all the apes in one month and then multiply that by 2.

1. Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
2. Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
3. Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

Total bananas needed per month = 200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas.

For 2 months, the total bananas needed = 700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas.

So, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Each back and forth is 200 yards (100 yards to the end and 100 yards back).

So, the total distance Blake runs is:
\[ 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. Each back and forth is 80 yards (40 yards to the 40-yard line and 40 yards back).

So, the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[ 34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we need to find out how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards. The difference in the distance they run is:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

So, the winner runs \(\boxed{280}\) yards farther than the loser."
"Raphael bought 4 pens at $1.5 each, so the total cost for the pens is 4 * $1.5 = $6. He also bought 2 notebooks at $4 each, so the total cost for the notebooks is 2 * $4 = $8. The rim of bond paper cost $20. 

To find the total amount Raphael spent, we add the cost of the pens, notebooks, and the bond paper together: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

Raphael spent $34 on everything."
"Finn originally sees 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 tadpoles come out from under a lily pad, and since they were hiding, we can assume that the number of tadpoles he can see increases by 6. So, he can now see 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles. After that, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, which means the number of tadpoles he can see decreases by 2. Therefore, he can see 17 - 2 = 15 tadpoles.

Final numerical answer:
15"
"On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday. Since the depth on Monday was 17 feet, the depth on Tuesday would be 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So, we calculate two thirds of 24 feet:

\(\frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16\) feet.

The tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. That's a total of:
10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish.

Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which is:
10 - 5 = 5 starfish.

Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, which is:
6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.

Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which is:
3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

So, Locsin caught a total of:
5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish.

Together, Anakin and Locsin caught:
19 + 13 = 32 fish.

"To find the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every two months. The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

First, let's find the price increase factor. A 20% increase means the price is multiplied by 1.20 every two months.

Since 36 months is 18 two-month periods, we need to apply the increase factor 18 times. The formula to find the final price after 36 months is:

\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} \times (1.20)^{18} \]

The original price is $20. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, let's calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):

\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366 \]

So, the final price is:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32 \]

Therefore, the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $787.32."
"Given that one red car costs $4 and an action figure costs $5, we can determine the cost of the doll and then calculate the total value of all the toys.

1. The doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since one action figure costs $5, the doll costs:
   \[
   3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. We know the cost of the red cars and action figures:
   - 5 red cars at $4 each:
     \[
     5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - 3 action figures at $5 each:
     \[
     3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - 1 doll at $15:
     \[
     15 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. Adding up the total cost of all the toys:
   \[
   20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

The total value of all the toys is:
\[
50 \text{ dollars}

"First, we need to calculate the amount of money Jackie will lose by doing her taxes herself instead of hiring an accountant. She will lose $35 for each hour of freelance work she doesn't do. If she loses 3 hours of work, the total loss in income is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \]

Next, we need to consider the cost of hiring the accountant, which is $90. To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of the accountant from the amount she would lose by doing her taxes herself:

\[ \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \]

So, if Jackie hires the accountant, she will have \$15 more. 

Final answer:
\[ \$15 \]"
"Elvira's total budget is €1500. She bought a computer for €1090, a scanner for €157, a CD burner for €74, and a printer for €102. Let's add up the costs of the items she bought:

€1090 (computer) + €157 (scanner) + €74 (CD burner) + €102 (printer) = €1423

Now, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget to find out how much money she has left for clothing:

€1500 - €1423 = €77

Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing."
"To make 15 Spanish flans, Sandra needs 3 eggs for each flan. So, the total number of eggs required is:

15 flans * 3 eggs/flan = 45 eggs

Sandra's neighbor gives her a basket of 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:

45 eggs / 9 eggs/babysitting = 5 babysitting sessions

So, Sandra has to babysit 5 times."
"Let's use some simple math to solve this problem.

1. Let's say Brooke's current age is \( B \).
2. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is \( 2B \).

In 2 years:
- Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \).
- Seth's age will be \( 2B + 2 \).

According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. So, we can write the equation:
\[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ 3B = 28 - 4 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

So, Brooke is currently 8 years old. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke:
\[ 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.

"Pancho walks 20 miles each day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, for those 5 days, he walks:

20 miles/day * 5 days = 100 miles

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles each day. So, for the 2 weekend days, he walks:

10 miles/day * 2 days = 20 miles

Adding the miles from weekdays and weekends together:

100 miles + 20 miles = 120 miles

So, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week."
"First, let's find the cost of the jacket. Since the jacket costs three times as much as the hat, and the hat costs $25, the jacket costs:

\[ 3 \times 25 = 75 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pants. The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. So, we add the cost of the hat and the cost of the jacket and then divide by 2:

\[ \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \]

Now, we add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:

\[ 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \]

So, the total cost of each uniform is:

\[ 150 \]"
"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs for each type of creature and then sum them up.

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, and Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo. So, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. So, Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. So, Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we add up the ages of all four birds:
- Sally Two: 19 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years

The total age of the four birds is \(19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51\).

"First, let's calculate the total minimum monthly payment Jessica needs to make on all her debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. So, we need to calculate 50% of $1000 and add it to the minimum:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

So, the total amount Jessica will pay each month is:

$1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:

$1500 * 12 = $18000

Therefore, Jessica pays $18000 in a year."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel one potato. It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato. Since there are 60 potatoes, the total time to peel all the potatoes is:

1.5 minutes/potato * 60 potatoes = 90 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut one potato. It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut one potato. For 60 potatoes, the total time to cut all the potatoes is:

5 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 300 seconds

To convert the cutting time into minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):

300 seconds / 60 = 5 minutes

Now, we add the time to peel and cut all the potatoes:

90 minutes (peeling) + 5 minutes (cutting) = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"First, let's figure out how many glasses of lemonade they sold to make a $25 profit.

The cost for lemons and sugar per gallon is $3 (lemons) + $2 (sugar) = $5.

Let's denote the number of gallons they made as \( G \). The total cost for \( G \) gallons is \( 5G \).

They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so the revenue from selling \( G \) gallons is \( 20G \times 0.50 = 10G \).

The profit is the revenue minus the cost, so we have:
\[ 10G - 5G = 25 \]
\[ 5G = 25 \]
\[ G = 5 \]

So, they made 5 gallons of lemonade. The cost for lemons and sugar for 5 gallons is:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

The cost for lemons alone is:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \]

Therefore, they spent $15 on lemons."

"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent and car fuel.

Zaid's rent is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his salary:
\[ \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \]

Zaid's car fuel is \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his salary:
\[ \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount spent on rent and car fuel:
\[ \text{Total spent} = 1500 + 2000 = 3500 \]

Now, we find out how much is left after these expenses:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 6000 - 3500 = 2500 \]

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity:
\[ \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \]

After the donation, the remaining amount is:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \]

Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$:
\[ \text{Total given to family} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, we calculate how much money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations:

"First, let's figure out Mark's age two years ago. We know that Jan is currently 30 years old. Two years ago, Jan was 28 years old. According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.

Half of Jan's age two years ago was 28 / 2 = 14 years.

So, two years ago, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.

Now, to find Mark's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

19 + 2 = 21 years old.

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we add 2 years to Mark's current age to find Jean's age:

21 + 2 = 23 years old.

Jean is 23 years old."
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay.

**Faster Team:**

**Less Well-Rounded Team:**
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Total time for the less well-rounded team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

**Difference in Time:**
The faster team's total time is 220 seconds, and the less well-rounded team's total time is 222 seconds.
Difference = 222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this, let's break it down into two parts: the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Part 1: Probability of Rolling a Number Greater Than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Expressed as a percentage, this is:
\[ 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

### Part 2: Probability of Rolling Two Even Numbers in a Row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number is:
\[ \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

For two even numbers in a row, we multiply the probabilities of each event:
\[ 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \]

Expressed as a percentage, this is:
\[ 0.25 \times 100 = 25\% \]

### Final Step: Calculate the Difference
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3:
\[ 50\% - 25\% = 25\% \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ 25\% \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the total number of pieces of straw used for each type of rodent.

1. **Hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = 10 cages * 5 pieces/cage = 50 pieces.

2. **Rabbits:**
   - There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.

3. **Total straw used for hamsters and rabbits:**
   - Total = 50 pieces (hamsters) + 20 pieces (rabbits) = 70 pieces.

4. **Straw used for rats:**
   - Total straw distributed = 160 pieces.
   - Straw used for rats = 160 pieces - 70 pieces = 90 pieces.

5. **Rats:**
   - The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for rats = 90 pieces.
   - Number of rats = 90 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 15 rats.
   - Since the rats are in 3 cages, the number of rats per cage = 15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats/cage.

The number of rats in each cage is 5."

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The tickets cost $20.25. The food cost $4.50 less than the tickets, so the food cost is:

\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we add the cost of the tickets and the food to find the total cost of these items:

\[ 20.25 + 15.75 = 36.00 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the rides. Each ride costs $33, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is:

\[ 33 \times 2 = 66.00 \]

Adding the cost of the rides to the cost of the tickets and food gives us the total amount spent:

\[ 36.00 + 66.00 = 102.00 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ 102.00 \div 3 = 34.00 \]

So, each of them paid:

\[ \boxed{34.00} \]"

So, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Trees planted and chopped down each year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year. So, the net increase in trees each year is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees.
3. **Number of years**: We need to calculate the number of trees after 10 years. Over 10 years, the net increase in trees is \(8 \times 10 = 80\) trees.
4. **Total number of trees after 10 years**: Adding the initial number of trees to the net increase, we get \(50 + 80 = 130\) trees.
5. **Trees that die**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, the number of trees that die is \(0.30 \times 130 = 39\) trees.
6. **Final number of trees**: Subtracting the number of trees that die from the total number of trees, we get \(130 - 39 = 91\) trees.

Then, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink plastic flamingos:
\[ 12 + 18 = 30 \]
So, there were 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

To find out how many more pink flamingos there were than white flamingos:
\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

At noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos."
"Violetta needs crayons in 5 different colors, and each crayon costs $2. So, the total cost for 5 crayons would be:

5 crayons * $2/crayon = $10

Violetta prepared $20 for the purchase. Therefore, the change she will get after buying the crayons is:

$20 - $10 = $10

$10"
"A pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. So, let's calculate the cost of a pen first.

The cost of a pencil is $1.20 and the cost of an eraser is $0.30. Therefore, the cost of a pen is:
\[ 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \]

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:
\[ 1.50 \times 8 = 12.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12.00 \]"
"Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots. There are 40 restaurants.

First, calculate the total amount of carrots needed for all the restaurants:
2 pounds/restaurant * 40 restaurants = 80 pounds

Now, subtract the total amount of carrots needed from the initial amount of carrots to find out how many pounds will not be used:
200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds

120 pounds of carrots will not be used."
"To find out how many kids are in Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - Number of men - Number of women
Number of children = 23786 - 8417 - 9092

Now, let's do the math:

23786 - 8417 = 15369
15369 - 9092 = 6277

So, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

In the first month, she collected three times that number, which is:
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards} \]

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \text{ cards} \]

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards collected in the first and second months is:
\[ 60 + 40 = 100 \text{ cards} \]
So, in the third month, she collected:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ cards} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now:
\[ 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 \]

So, Elaine has a total of 320 Pokemon cards now."
"Mark edits 1000 sentences each week, equally for two publishers. So, he edits 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, for 500 sentences, he earns:
5 cents/sentence * 500 sentences = 2500 cents

Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays, so:
2 * 5 cents/sentence = 10 cents/sentence

For 500 sentences at 10 cents per sentence, he earns:
10 cents/sentence * 500 sentences = 5000 cents

Adding the earnings from both publishers:
2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

Mark makes 7500 cents in a week."
"Baldur gets 5 pails of water in the morning and 6 pails in the afternoon. That's a total of 5 + 6 = 11 pails of water every day. Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, the total amount of water he gets every day is 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

55 liters"
"First, let's calculate John's annual salary before the raise. Since he makes $2000 every week and there are 52 weeks in a year, his annual salary is:

\[ 2000 \times 52 = 104000 \]

Next, we need to calculate the new salary after the 5% raise. A 5% raise on his current salary means his new salary will be:

\[ 104000 + (104000 \times 0.05) = 104000 + 5200 = 109200 \]

Now, we need to calculate his total earnings for the year. He will earn his new salary of $109200 plus the one-time monetary reward of $5000. Therefore, his total earnings for the year are:

\[ 109200 + 5000 = 114200 \]

So, the total amount of money John made that year is:

\[ \boxed{114200} \]"
"First, we calculate the total tons of grapes produced by the farm. Since each acre produces 5 tons of grapes and Josie has 10 acres, the total tons of grapes produced per year is:

10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Next, we calculate the total barrels of wine produced. Since each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine, the total barrels of wine produced per year is:

50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

Therefore, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the cheese used for each meal and then sum them up.

1. **Sandwiches for Lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch.
   - He used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Total slices of cheese for sandwiches: \(2 \text{ slices/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 14 \text{ slices}\).

2. **Omelets for Breakfast:**
   - Carl ate an omelet 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet used 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet used \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese for omelets: \(3 \text{ slices/omelet} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ slices}\).

3. **Macaroni and Cheese for Dinners:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese and used 8 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese for macaroni and cheese: \(8 \text{ slices}\).

Now, we sum up all the slices of cheese used:
\[14 \text{ slices (sandwiches)} + 9 \text{ slices (omelets)} + 8 \text{ slices (macaroni and cheese)} = 31 \text{ slices}\]

**Final Answer:**
31 slices of cheese."
"Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. So, the total number of pens she had initially is:

22 (green pens) + 10 (yellow pens) = 32 pens

She then bought 6 bags of blue pens, with each bag containing 9 pens. So, the total number of blue pens is:

6 (bags) × 9 (pens per bag) = 54 blue pens

She also bought 2 bags of red pens, with each bag containing 6 pens. So, the total number of red pens is:

2 (bags) × 6 (pens per bag) = 12 red pens

Now, to find the total number of pens Janet has now, we add the initial pens to the blue and red pens:

32 (initial pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 98 pens

So, Janet has 98 pens now."
"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to get an average of 93, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the average calculation**: The average score is calculated by summing all the test scores and then dividing by the number of tests. Since Mr. Bert allows removing the lowest score, we will remove the lowest score from the first five tests before calculating the average.

2. **Identify the lowest score from the first five tests**: The scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score is 71.

3. **Calculate the sum of the remaining scores**: Remove 71 from the list and sum the rest.
   \[
   89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367
   \]

4. **Include the sixth test score**: Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test. The sum of the remaining scores plus the sixth test score is \( 367 + x \).

5. **Set up the equation for the average**: We want the average of the four highest scores to be 93. The equation for the average is:
   \[
   \frac{367 + x}{4} = 93
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   \[
   367 + x = 93 \times 4
   \]
   \[
   367 + x = 372
   \]
   \[
   x = 372 - 367
   \]
   \[
   x = 5

So, Brinley needs to score **5** on her sixth test to get an average of 93."
"Micheal rode his bike 5 times a week for 25 kilometers each time for 4 weeks. So, the total distance for the first period is:

5 times/week * 25 kilometers/time * 4 weeks = 500 kilometers

Then, he changed his routine to riding 2 times a week for 60 kilometers each time for 3 weeks. So, the total distance for the second period is:

2 times/week * 60 kilometers/time * 3 weeks = 360 kilometers

Adding both periods together, the total distance Micheal rode his bike is:

500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers

"Each chocolate bar weighs 40g. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 20g.

Joe has 25 chocolate bars, so the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars * 40g/chocolate bar = 1000g

Joe also has 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 candied apples * 20g/candied apple = 1600g

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is:
1000g (chocolate bars) + 1600g (candied apples) = 2600g

"On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

To find the total number of cakes she bought over the three days, we add the number of cakes from each day:

\(4 + 12 + 60 = 76\)

So, Rose bought 76 cakes after all three days."
"First, let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

1. **Cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates would be 6 plates.
   - So, the cost of half a dozen plates is \(6 \times 6000 = 36000\) dollars.

2. **Cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups would be \(20 \times 12 = 240\) cups.
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is \(36000 - 1200 = 34800\) dollars.

3. **Cost of each cup:**
   - We have 240 cups and the total cost is $34800.
   - The cost of each cup is \(\frac{34800}{240}\).

Now, let's calculate the cost of each cup:
\[
\frac{34800}{240} = 145
\]

So, the total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{145}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- Sara babysits 4 times, earning $5 each time, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.

Now, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from mowing the lawn:
- Let \(x\) be the number of times Sara mows the lawn.
- Her parents pay her $4 each time, so she earns \(4x\) dollars from mowing the lawn.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the total amount of money Sara has before mowing the lawn is \(10 + 20 = 30\) dollars.

To find out how much more money Sara needs to afford the jacket and shoes, we subtract the amount she already has from the total cost:
- The amount needed is \(70 - 30 = 40\) dollars.

Since Sara earns $4 for each time she mows the lawn, we need to find \(x\) such that \(4x = 40\):
- Solving for \(x\), we get \(x = \frac{40}{4} = 10\).

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

Final answer:
10"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"First, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Gary walks the perimeter of the park, which is 15 miles. He walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking."
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we need to subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total.

So, the number of customers on the third day is \(500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\).

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, we can express the amount of water in each pool 4 minutes ago as follows:

- The small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons 4 minutes ago.
- The big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons 4 minutes ago.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the problem also states that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

Substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool now has \( S = 8 \) gallons of water. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the shoes and the belt. The shoes cost $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00. Adding these together:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost is $352.00. Lori earns $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ 352.00 \div 8.00 = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10%. 

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Janeth will pay in total over 12 months. She is paying $165 each month for 12 months, so the total payment is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we subtract the total payment from the total amount to be returned to find the remaining balance:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be:
\[ 220 \]"
"There are 4 roses in the vase.

There are 7 more dahlias than roses, so there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias in the vase.

Total number of flowers in the vase: 15."
"First, let's find the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack.

Given that Harriet is 21 years old now, and Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can find Zack's age:
\[ \text{Zack's age} = 21 \times 2 = 42 \text{ years old} \]

Next, since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can find Adrian's age:
\[ \text{Adrian's age} = 21 \times 3 = 63 \text{ years old} \]

Now, in three years, their ages will be:
- Adrian: \(63 + 3 = 66\) years old
- Harriet: \(21 + 3 = 24\) years old
- Zack: \(42 + 3 = 45\) years old

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{66 + 24 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \]

The average age of the three in three years is 45."
"First, let's find out how many points each student scored.

Naomi scored 68 points.

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is \(68 \div 2 = 34\). So, Yuri scored \(34 + 10 = 44\) points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna scored \(68 + 17 = 85\) points.

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[68 + 44 + 85 = 197\]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. So, to find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total:
\[251 - 197 = 54\]

Jojo scored 54 points."

"Initially, the water tank has 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters to water her garden, so the amount of water left in the tank is:

120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters

Celine then collected rainwater, which is twice the amount left in the tank. So, the amount of rainwater collected is:

2 * 30 liters = 60 liters

Adding the rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives:

30 liters + 60 liters = 90 liters

So, the final amount of water in the tank is 90 liters."
"Andy plants 90 geraniums. He plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, so he plants 90 - 40 = 50 petunias.

"First, let's calculate the new number of each type of card James has after the changes:

- Fire type: 30 (no change)
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

Next, we find the total number of cards James has now:
30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards

Now, to find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

So:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 33.33 \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is:
\[ 33 \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the burrito with all the add-ons:

- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces: $0.25 each, so $0.25 x 2 = $0.50

Adding these up: $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00

Next, we add the upgrade cost:
- Upgrade: $3.00

So, the total before the gift card is: $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad uses a $5.00 gift card, so we subtract that from the total:
- Total after gift card: $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Therefore, Chad still owes $9.00."

Kalinda places 4 pieces per minute.

Her mom places half as many pieces as Kalinda, so her mom places \(4 \div 2 = 2\) pieces per minute.

Together, they place \(4 + 2 = 6\) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place together per minute:

"First, we need to find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest when Ashlyn first went to the farm. Since 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ 120 \times 0.30 = 36 \]

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest initially. This means the number of watermelons that were not ready for harvest at that time is:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

When Ashlyn returned two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. We calculate the number of watermelons that were ready at this time:

\[ 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63 \]

So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest the second time Ashlyn visited. This means the number of watermelons that were not ready for harvest after the two weeks is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

Therefore, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration. Each car costs $20,000 and Mark buys 12 cars.

Total cost of cars = 12 * $20,000 = $240,000

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%.

Tax = 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the cars.

Total cost with tax = $240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000

Next, we calculate the registration cost. Each car has a $1000 registration fee, and there are 12 cars.

Total registration cost = 12 * $1000 = $12,000

Finally, we add the total registration cost to the total cost with tax to get the final amount Mark pays.

Final amount = $264,000 + $12,000 = $276,000

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

$276,000"

"Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. Since he eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes per day. Together, they eat 6 (Steve) + 3 (girlfriend) = 9 tomatoes per day.

To find out how many tomatoes they need in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (days in a week):
9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 tomatoes/week.

Since a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed is:
63 tomatoes/week ÷ 3 tomatoes/vine/week = 21 vines.

So, Steve needs 21 vines to produce enough tomatoes for both him and his girlfriend."
"First, we need to calculate the total number of pizza slices required. Since there are 20 friends and each friend wants 4 slices, we multiply 20 by 4:

20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions. To find out how many pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:

80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas

So, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"Ram starts with 25 pens. Each time he uses 5 empty pens, he can make 1 new pen by mixing the ink.

First, let's see how many new pens he can make from the initial 25 pens:
- He uses 5 pens to make 1 new pen.
- 25 pens can be divided into 5 groups of 5 pens each.
- So, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.

Now, he has the 5 new pens plus the 5 pens he didn't use from the initial 25 pens, making a total of 10 pens.

Next, he can use these 10 pens to make more new pens:
- He uses 5 pens to make 1 new pen.
- 10 pens can be divided into 2 groups of 5 pens each.
- So, he can make 10 / 5 = 2 new pens.

Now, he has the 2 new pens plus the 5 pens he didn't use from the 10 pens, making a total of 7 pens.

Next, he can use these 7 pens to make more new pens:
- He uses 5 pens to make 1 new pen.
- 7 pens can be divided into 1 group of 5 pens and 2 pens left over.
- So, he can make 7 / 5 = 1 new pen (ignoring the remainder for now).

Now, he has the 1 new pen plus the 2 pens he didn't use from the 7 pens, making a total of 3 pens.

Next, he can use these 3 pens to make more new pens:
- He uses 5 pens to make 1 new pen, but he only has 3 pens.
- So, he can't make any new pens from these 3 pens.

So, the total number of pens he ends up with is the initial 25 pens plus the 5 pens, 2 pens, and 1 pen he made, which is 25 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 33 pens.

Final answer:
33"
"Johnny started with $20 and added an extra $10, so he had a total of $20 + $10 = $30. 

After a year, his investment tripled, so he had $30 * 3 = $90.

Therefore, after a year, Johnny had $90."
"Jessa is 20 years old.

Joan is five years older than Jessa, so Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.

Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.

The sum of the ages of the three girls is 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.

"First, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we calculate:

30% of 1000 = 0.30 * 1000 = 300 students

After 300 students went out through exit A, the remaining number of students is:

1000 - 300 = 700 students

Next, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit B. Since 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B, we calculate:

3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students

After 420 students went out through exit B, the remaining number of students is:

700 - 420 = 280 students

These remaining students went out through exit C. Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is:

280 students

"Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book. If they read each other's books as well as their own, Dolly will read 3 books (2 of her own and 1 from Pandora), and Pandora will read 3 books (1 of her own and 2 from Dolly).

So, the total number of books read by both of them is 3 (Dolly) + 3 (Pandora) = 6 books.

6 books"
"Mike was originally pen pals with 5 people and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now pen pals with 5 - 2 = 3 people.

Each of these 3 people sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, the total number of pages Mike receives in a week is 3 people * 2 letters/person * 5 pages/letter = 30 pages.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages a week.

Mike writes a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, to write 30 pages, he spends 30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

Therefore, Mike spends 3 hours writing a week."
"First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason uses for his 15-minute calls with his boss each day. Since there are 30 days in the month, he uses:

15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes he used for calls to other people:

450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the monthly plan:

1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

So, Jason has 250 minutes left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. After receiving \(x\) fries, Griffin has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby takes 2 fries, Griffin has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin \(\boxed{20}\) fries."
"First, let's find the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums. There are 32 snails in one aquarium and 4 snails in the other, so the difference is:

32 - 4 = 28 snails

According to the problem, this difference (28 snails) is twice the number of fish in both aquariums combined. So, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2 * (number of fish in both aquariums)

To find the number of fish in both aquariums, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

28 / 2 = 14

This means there are 14 fish in both aquariums combined. Since the problem states that both aquariums have the same number of fish, we divide this number by 2:

14 / 2 = 7

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

7 fish per aquarium."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works each week:

6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week

Now, let's calculate the total number of hours for the 5 weeks:

24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost before the discount is:

120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

The makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. So, we need to calculate 10% of $30,000:

10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:

$30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

Jean paid $27,000."
"First, let's add up all the expenses Isabelle had for the party supplies:

- Cake ingredients: $12
- Birthday presents: $43
- Decorations: $15
- Invitations: $4
- Goodie bags: $22

Now, let's sum these amounts:

$12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, so the cost is divided into 3 equal parts. To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3:

$96 ÷ 3 = $32

Each person paid $32."
"The chef bought 4 bags of onions, with each bag weighing 50 pounds. So, the total weight of onions is 4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds. 

The cost of one pound of onions is $1.50. Therefore, the total cost for 200 pounds is 200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300.

The chef spent $300."
"On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

Sue's total cookies: \(20 + 26 = 46\)
Sue's sister's total cookies: \(5 + 13 = 18\)

Next, we calculate the calories consumed by each. Since 1 cookie has 200 calories:

Sue's total calories: \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories
Sue's sister's total calories: \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed:

\(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories

Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."
"To find the number of boys in the third class, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of students in the school:**
   - Each class has 20 students.
   - There are 3 classes.
   - Total students = 20 students/class * 3 classes = 60 students.

2. **Number of boys and girls in the school:**
   - The school is 50% boys and 50% girls.
   - Number of boys = 50% of 60 = 0.5 * 60 = 30 boys.
   - Number of girls = 50% of 60 = 0.5 * 60 = 30 girls.

3. **Number of girls in the first and second classes:**
   - First class has 15 girls.
   - Second class has 12 girls.
   - Total girls in the first and second classes = 15 + 12 = 27 girls.

4. **Number of girls in the third class:**
   - Total girls in the school = 30.
   - Girls in the third class = Total girls - Girls in the first and second classes = 30 - 27 = 3 girls.

5. **Number of boys in the third class:**
   - Each class has 20 students.
   - Third class has 3 girls.
   - Boys in the third class = Total students in the third class - Girls in the third class = 20 - 3 = 17 boys.

**Final answer:**
17 boys are in the third class."

"Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Since he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

So, today he killed 3 * 12 = 36 wolves.

In total, Rick killed 10 + 12 = 22 animals last night and 36 wolves today.

Therefore, the total number of animals Rick killed is 22 + 36 = 58.

"Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times.

Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times Anne went down, we calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30:
\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]
So, Anne went down the slide:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down by 4:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cows before Mr. Sylas buys more. There are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so:

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, the number of new cows per stall is:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we add the new cows to the original number of cows in each stall:

\[ 20 \text{ original cows/stall} + 2 \text{ new cows/stall} = 22 \text{ cows/stall} \]

To find the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:

\[ 22 \text{ cows/stall} \times 8 \text{ stalls} = 176 \text{ cows} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the total number of 10-foot sections in the 200-foot tall redwood. We do this by dividing the total height by the length of each section:

200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Next, we calculate the weight of the entire redwood before the termites ate any of it. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we multiply the number of sections by the weight per section:

20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

Now, we need to find out how much of the redwood was eaten by the termites. Since the termites ate 30% of the redwood, we calculate 30% of the total weight:

30% of 8000 pounds = 0.30 * 8000 pounds = 2400 pounds

To find the remaining weight of the redwood after the termites ate some of it, we subtract the weight eaten by the termites from the original weight:

8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

So, the final weight of the redwood is 5600 pounds."
"Nancy owes $0.50 for each of the 8 books, so we first calculate the total amount for the books:

\[ 8 \text{ books} \times \$0.50 \text{ per book} = \$4.00 \]

Additionally, she has to pay a flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book that's over a week overdue. So, we add this flat fee to the amount for the books:

\[ \$4.00 + \$2.00 = \$6.00 \]

Therefore, Nancy has to pay a total of:

\[ \$6.00 \]"
"Andrea has 52 apples. 

Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, Jamal has:
\[ 52 - 8 = 44 \text{ apples} \]

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has:
\[ 44 + 4 = 48 \text{ bananas} \]

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has:
\[ \frac{48}{2} = 24 \text{ bananas} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits:
- Andrea's total fruits: \(52 \text{ apples} + 24 \text{ bananas} = 76 \text{ fruits}\)
- Jamal's total fruits: \(44 \text{ apples} + 48 \text{ bananas} = 92 \text{ fruits}\)

Adding 5 to this number gives us the number of trees Harry has:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ trees} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand. We subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:

\[ 11 - 3 = 8 \]

So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. 

Final numerical answer:

All three girls have a combined total of $400."
"First, let's calculate the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price of $350,000.

Brokerage fee = 5% of $350,000
Brokerage fee = 0.05 * $350,000
Brokerage fee = $17,500

Next, let's calculate the transfer fee, which is 12% of the selling price of $350,000.

Transfer fee = 12% of $350,000
Transfer fee = 0.12 * $350,000
Transfer fee = $42,000

Now, let's add the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee to find the total price of the house.

Total price = Selling price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
Total price = $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000
Total price = $409,500

Finally, let's find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget of $400,000.

Difference = Total price - Budget
Difference = $409,500 - $400,000
Difference = $9,500

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"First, let's calculate the transfer fees. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Transfer fees} = 3\% \times 400,000 = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price of $400,000.

\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \times 400,000 = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

Now, let's add the transfer fees and the brokerage fee to find the total fees paid.

\[ \text{Total fees} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 \]

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house. To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds, we need to subtract the total fees and the remaining loan amount from the selling price.

\[ \text{Net proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000 \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are $118,000."
"First, we need to calculate the time it takes to heat the oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees. It takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees, and it takes 40% longer to heat it to 400 degrees.

To find 40% of 20 minutes:
\[ 20 \times 0.40 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the time to heat the oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes to cook the chicken. It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. Since it took 20 minutes to warm the oil to 300 degrees, the total time to warm the oil is:
\[ 20 + 28 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

The time to cook the chicken is:
\[ 48 - 5 = 43 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is:
\[ 48 + 43 = 91 \text{ minutes} \]

"To find out how much the real estate agent spent on all the ads, we need to calculate the total cost for the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the newspaper ads:
- The agent spent $5 on each newspaper ad.
- He bought 50 newspaper ads.

So, the total cost for the newspaper ads is:
\[ 50 \text{ ads} \times \$5 \text{ per ad} = \$250 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the television ads:
- The agent spent $75 on each television ad.
- He bought 15 television ads.

So, the total cost for the television ads is:
\[ 15 \text{ ads} \times \$75 \text{ per ad} = \$1125 \]

Now, we add the total costs of the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total amount spent:
\[ \$250 + \$1125 = \$1375 \]

Therefore, the real estate agent spent a total of \$1375 on buying all the ads."
"The juggler can juggle 16 balls in total. Half of these balls are golf balls, so there are 16 / 2 = 8 golf balls. Half of these golf balls are blue, so there are 8 / 2 = 4 blue golf balls.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has:
300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

To find the total number of M&Ms, we add the M&Ms from all three bags:
300 + 312 + 150 = 762 M&Ms.

Mary got a total of 762 M&Ms."
"First, let's calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms. Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. So, for one house, the number of bedroom windows is:

3 bedrooms/house * 2 windows/bedroom = 6 windows/house

Since John has 2 houses, the total number of bedroom windows in both houses is:

6 windows/house * 2 houses = 12 windows

Next, we need to account for the additional windows in each house. There are 4 additional windows in each house, so for 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is:

4 windows/house * 2 houses = 8 windows

Now, we add the number of bedroom windows and the additional windows to get the total number of windows:

12 bedroom windows + 8 additional windows = 20 windows

So, the total number of windows between the houses is 20."
"To find out how much change the cashier gives back, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items the mother bought.

The cost of cocoa is $4.20.
The cost of laundry is $9.45.
The cost of a package of pasta is $1.35.

Now, let's add these amounts together:

$4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $15.00

The total cost of the items is $15.00.

The mother pays with $20.00.

To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:

$20.00 - $15.00 = $5.00

The cashier gives back $5.00."
"First, let's calculate the number of stitches for the collar. The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches that the body of the sweater takes. So, the collar takes:

\[ \frac{900}{10} = 90 \text{ stitches} \]

Next, we calculate the number of stitches for the rosette. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so:

\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \text{ stitches} \]

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We can find the total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette by adding the stitches for these parts together:

\[ 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \text{ stitches} \]

The remaining stitches are for the two sleeves. To find the number of stitches for the two sleeves, we subtract the total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches in the sweater:

\[ 1800 - 1170 = 630 \text{ stitches} \]

Since the sweater has two sleeves, we divide the remaining stitches by 2 to find the number of stitches for each sleeve:

\[ \frac{630}{2} = 315 \text{ stitches} \]

So, each sleeve takes 315 stitches."
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the tomato seeds:
- She bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.
- Each packet of tomato seeds costs $40.
- So, the total cost for tomato seeds is \(20 \times 40 = 800\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the celery seeds:
- She bought 80 packets of celery seeds.
- Each packet of celery seeds costs $30.
- So, the total cost for celery seeds is \(80 \times 30 = 2400\) dollars.

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total cost:
- Total cost for tomato seeds: $800
- Total cost for celery seeds: $2400
- Total cost for all seeds: \(800 + 2400 = 3200\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is $3200."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Lyrics to the Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   - Therefore, the first scene has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, Sean's lines in the first scene are \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\).

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
   - Therefore, the second scene has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, Sean's lines in the second scene are \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\).

4. **Total Lines to Memorize:**
   - Sean has to memorize the lines from the solo song, the first scene, and the second scene.
   - Total lines = Lines from the solo song + Sean's lines from the first scene + Sean's lines from the second scene.
   - Total lines = \(54 + 36 + 48 = 138\).

Therefore, Sean has to memorize 138 lines."
"First, let's find out how many cards had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

So, 32 cards had the letter A on them.

Next, we need to find out how many cards were left after removing the cards with the letter A:

\[ 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Now, 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B on them. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

This means 24 cards had the letter B on them.

We then find out how many cards were left after removing the cards with the letter B:

\[ 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Next, 5/8 of the rest had the letter C on them. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

This means 15 cards had the letter C on them.

Finally, to find out how many cards had the letter D on them, we subtract the number of cards with letters A, B, and C from the total number of cards:

\[ 80 - (32 + 24 + 15) = 80 - 71 = 9 \]

So, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total time Matthew spends digging both small and large holes and then convert that time into hours.

First, let's calculate the time for the small holes:
- Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
- He needs to dig 30 small holes.
- So, the total time for small holes is \(30 \times 3 = 90\) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time for the large holes:
- Matthew takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
- He needs to dig 15 large holes.
- So, the total time for large holes is \(15 \times 10 = 150\) minutes.

Now, let's add the time for both small and large holes:
- Total time in minutes = \(90 + 150 = 240\) minutes.

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- So, \(240\) minutes is \(240 \div 60 = 4\) hours.

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes."
"The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 20 + 10 + 10 = 40.

40"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

Sam is 6 years old."
"To find out how much Peter paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the popsicles:
- Peter bought 20 popsicles.
- Each popsicle costs $0.25.
- So, the total cost for the popsicles is \(20 \times 0.25 = 5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars:
- Peter bought 4 ice cream bars.
- Each ice cream bar costs $0.50.
- So, the total cost for the ice cream bars is \(4 \times 0.50 = 2\) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:
- Total cost = cost of popsicles + cost of ice cream bars
- Total cost = \(5 + 2 = 7\) dollars.

Therefore, Peter paid a total of 7 dollars."
"First, let's find out how many spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can find the number of spots on a mamba by dividing the number of spots on a cobra by 2.

So, a mamba has \( \frac{70}{2} = 35 \) spots.

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras. There are 40 cobras, and each cobra has 70 spots. So, the total number of spots for all cobras is \( 40 \times 70 = 2800 \) spots.

Then, we calculate the total number of spots for all the mambas. There are 60 mambas, and each mamba has 35 spots. So, the total number of spots for all mambas is \( 60 \times 35 = 2100 \) spots.

Now, we add the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas to get the combined total number of spots. This is \( 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \) spots.

Finally, we need to find half of this combined total number of spots. So, we divide 4900 by 2, which gives us \( \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \).

Therefore, half the number of spots they all have combined is 2450."
"First, let's calculate the total number of people at the soccer game. There are 12 team members and each brings 2 guests, so that's 12 team members + (12 team members * 2 guests) = 12 + 24 = 36 people from the team members and their guests. Adding the 3 coaches, the total number of people is 36 + 3 = 39.

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are needed. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3: 39 people / 3 people per pizza = 13 pizzas.

Finally, to find out how much Maddy will spend, we multiply the number of pizzas by the cost per pizza: 13 pizzas * $15 per pizza = $195.

Maddy will spend $195."
"To determine how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones.
2. Subtract this length from the total length of the necklace to find the length occupied by the sterling silver beads.
3. Determine how many sterling silver beads fit into the remaining length.

First, let's calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones. Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones, and each gemstone is 1 inch long:
\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch per gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we subtract the length occupied by the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace to find the length occupied by the sterling silver beads:
\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find out how many beads fit into 17 inches, we divide 17 by 1/4:
\[ 17 \div \frac{1}{4} = 17 \times 4 = 68 \]

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. 

In the second week, they each doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

Now, let's add up all the stories they wrote:
- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

The total number of stories they wrote altogether is:
\[60 + 120 + 180 = 360\]

"Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. 

5 quarters equal 5 * 25 cents = 125 cents.
2 dimes equal 2 * 10 cents = 20 cents.

So, Kelly has a total of 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents.

If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, she will have 145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents left.

90 cents"
"First, let's calculate the total number of stars in the three rows of 8 stars and the two rows of 6 stars.

For the three rows of 8 stars:
3 rows * 8 stars/row = 24 stars

For the two rows of 6 stars:
2 rows * 6 stars/row = 12 stars

Now, let's add these together to find the total number of stars in these five rows:
24 stars + 12 stars = 36 stars

The flag has 76 stars in total. To find out how many stars are in the 5-star rows, we subtract the 36 stars from the total:
76 stars - 36 stars = 40 stars

Now, to find out how many rows of 5 stars there are, we divide the remaining stars by 5:
40 stars / 5 stars/row = 8 rows

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars altogether on the flag.

"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, we first need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones.

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:
\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Each truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed, we divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight capacity of one truck:
\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip."
"The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour. The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover 480 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the slow lane:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"First, let's find out how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, Izzy has:

22 - 5 = 17 medals

Now, let's find out the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

22 (Ali's medals) + 17 (Izzy's medals) = 39 medals

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals they have together. So, we can set up the equation:

Total medals given out = 10 * (Ali's medals + Izzy's medals)
Total medals given out = 10 * 39
Total medals given out = 390

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390."
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available. There are 8 packets, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is:

\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ bars per packet} = 40 \text{ bars} \]

Next, we need to determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get. There are 4 adults, and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars the adults will get is:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ bars per adult} = 24 \text{ bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ bars} - 24 \text{ bars} = 16 \text{ bars} \]

There are 8 children, and the remaining 16 chocolate bars need to be shared equally among them. So, each child will get:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ bars per child} \]

Each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so the actual working time is 2.5 hours.

First, convert the working time into minutes:
2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Next, calculate how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:
150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Since Susan earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, her total earnings are:
15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

Susan earns $75 for the online task."
"Mike has 21 points after 3 rounds.
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.
Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point. Mike now has 21 + 1 = 22 points.
Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point. Jim still has 18 points.
Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point. Tony now has 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up the points for all three players:
Mike: 22 points
Jim: 18 points
Tony: 43 points

Total points = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points.

"Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since each person eats rice at both lunch and dinner, each person consumes 0.2 kg x 2 = 0.4 kg of rice per day.

There are 5 members in the household, so the total daily consumption of rice is 0.4 kg x 5 = 2 kg.

A 42 kg bag of rice will last for 42 kg / 2 kg per day = 21 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for 21 days / 7 days per week = 3 weeks.

- Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates.
- On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
- On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
- On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

Now, let's add these up:

20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates

Sam's target was 120 crates, so we subtract the number of crates he sold from his target:

120 - 65 = 55 crates

Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week."

"First, let's calculate the total distance John drives each day. Since his work is 30 miles away and he has to go there and back, he drives 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles each day.

Next, we calculate the total distance he drives in a week. He goes to work 5 days a week, so he drives 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week.

Now, we calculate the total distance he drives in a year. He works 50 weeks a year, so he drives 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year.

Since he is charged $2 per mile, the cost for the miles driven in a year is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

He also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus for the year is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800.

Finally, we add the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus to find the total cost for the year. The total cost is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

Therefore, the total amount John pays a year for driving is $31,800."

"To find out how many books Elise sold in the second year, we need to first determine how many books she sold in the first and third years.

1. **Total books in the collection**: 250
2. **Books currently unsold**: 50
3. **Books sold in the third year**: 45

From the above, we can calculate the number of books sold in the first two years:
\[ \text{Books sold in the first two years} = 250 - 50 - 45 = 155 \]

Let's denote the number of books sold in the second year as \( x \).

According to the problem, Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. Since the current year is the third year, and she sold 45 books in the third year, she sold:
\[ 2 \times 45 = 90 \text{ books in the first year} \]

Now, we can find the number of books sold in the second year:
\[ 90 + x + 45 = 155 \]
\[ 135 + x = 155 \]
\[ x = 155 - 135 \]
\[ x = 20 \]

So, Elise sold 20 books in the second year. Since each book sells for $20, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \]

**Final answer:**
\[ 400 \]"
"Watson works 10 hours each day for 5 days a week, so he works 50 hours a week. He earns $10 per hour, so his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:

\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Half of the remaining 20 loaves are sold in the afternoon and the other half in the evening. So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Therefore, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon."
"Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so he loses 2 pounds per week (8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds/week).

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in a week, Sandy will take 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds.

To lose 8 pounds, which is the same as Joey, we need to calculate how many weeks it will take Sandy. Since Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks, to lose 8 pounds, it will take Sandy 8 / 2 * 4 = 16 weeks.

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds."

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits. Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each:
\[ 6 \times 100 = 600 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases. Theo buys 3 suitcases at $50 each:
\[ 3 \times 50 = 150 \]

Now, let's determine the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times the cost of a business suit is:
\[ 5 \times 100 = 500 \]
Adding $700 to this amount gives the cost of the flight ticket:
\[ 500 + 700 = 1200 \]

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip. So, the total amount he can spend on the suits, suitcases, and gifts is:
\[ 6000 - 2000 = 4000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent on the suits, suitcases, and flight ticket:
\[ 600 + 150 + 1200 = 2000 \]

To find out how much Theo has left to spend on gifts, we subtract the total amount spent on the suits, suitcases, and flight ticket from the total amount he can spend:

Now, let's add the daily consumption of both groups:
9 eggs + 4 eggs = 13 eggs per day

Since they eat eggs every day, we need to find out how many eggs they consume in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
13 eggs/day * 7 days = 91 eggs

The family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"Quinn is 30 years old.

Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so Jane is:
30 - 3 = 27 years old.

Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent is:
27 + 5 = 32 years old.

Trent is 32 years old."
"First, let's determine Noah's age six years ago. Since Cera is currently 46 years old, six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.

According to the problem, six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. So, Noah's age six years ago was 40 / 2 = 20 years.

Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time. So, the population six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. Therefore, the current population of Chile is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

Final numerical answer:
120,000"
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem, the number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).

The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:

\[ 6D + D = 210 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):

\[ D = \frac{210}{7} = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

Final numerical answer:
30"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) people.

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Now, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:

- Total people invited: 24
- People who couldn't come: 10

So, the number of people who show up is \(24 - 10 = 14\).

Final answer:
14"
"First, let's calculate the number of marbles Solomon received from his father. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, and his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought. So, the number of marbles his father gave him is:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

Now, let's find out the total number of marbles Solomon has. He initially had 50 marbles in the store, bought 20 more from Johanna, and received 8 more from his father. So, the total number of marbles is:

\[ 50 + 20 + 8 = 78 \]

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of the marbles is:

\[ 78 \times 2 = 156 \]

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:

\[ 156 \text{ kgs} \]"
"To find out how much it costs to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to find out the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $.1 per cubic foot. So, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot:

\[ \text{Cost} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"The classroom has 30 boys.

Since there are 3 times as many girls as boys, the number of girls is:
3 * 30 = 90 girls

The number of nongendered children is 1/10 as many as the number of boys, so:
1/10 * 30 = 3 nongendered children

To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
30 boys + 90 girls + 3 nongendered children = 123 children

Total number of children in the classroom: 123"
"The ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3. This means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.

Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles as follows:

Since the ratio is 1:3, for every 3 electric wires, there is 1 electric pole. Therefore, we can set up the proportion:

\[ \text{Number of electric poles} = \frac{\text{Number of electric wires}}{3} \]

Substituting the given number of electric wires:

\[ \text{Number of electric poles} = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \]

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15."
"At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, 1/4 of 40 is 10 people.

This means 30 people stayed at the party (40 - 10 = 30).

We know that 22 men stayed at the party. Since there were originally 25 men, the number of men who left is 3 (25 - 22 = 3).

Since 10 people left in total and 3 of them were men, the number of women who left is 7 (10 - 3 = 7).

Originally, there were 15 women, so the number of women who stayed is 8 (15 - 7 = 8).

Therefore, the number of women left at the party is 8."
"The book costs $4. The magazine costs half as much as the book, so the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2. A pen costs $1 less than a magazine, so the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

The pen costs $1."
"First, let's find out how many pencils Jam has in total. Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together make 26 pencils. 

So, the total number of pencils Jam has is 26.

Next, we know that Meg has 46 pencils.

To find out the total number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together, we add Jam's pencils to Meg's pencils:

26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 pencils

Now, we need to determine how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all 72 pencils. Since we know that Jam has 3 boxes and each box presumably holds the same number of pencils as the 2 loose pencils she has, we can assume each box holds 2 pencils.

So, each box holds 2 pencils. To find out how many boxes are needed for 72 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

72 pencils ÷ 2 pencils/box = 36 boxes

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 36 boxes to store all their pencils."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ice cubes Shannon uses to cool the coffee by 65 degrees and then calculate how much the coffee is weakened by adding both the ice cubes and the cream.

First, let's find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. So, the number of ice cubes needed is:
\[ \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much the coffee is weakened by adding these 5 ice cubes. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so:
\[ 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters} \]

Additionally, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. So, the total weakening from the ice cubes and the cream is:
\[ 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio and how it applies to the number of new records the people received.

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means for every new record received, 2 old records are given up.

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records given up as follows:

Since 1 new record requires 2 old records, 7 new records would require \(7 \times 2 = 14\) old records.

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"First, let's find out how many junior programmers there are. Since the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40

Now, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. So, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:

Total for junior programmers = 40 * $2000 = $80,000

Next, we need to find out how many senior programmers there are. Since the total number of employees is 100 and there are 40 junior programmers, the number of senior programmers is:

Number of senior programmers = Total employees - Junior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers. Since junior programmers are paid $2000, senior programmers are paid:

Senior programmer pay = $2000 + $400 = $2400

So, the total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:

Total for senior programmers = 60 * $2400 = $144,000

Finally, to find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we add the total for junior programmers and the total for senior programmers:

Total amount paid = Total for junior programmers + Total for senior programmers = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $224,000."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's say the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( x \).

2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in. So, the total number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).

3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in. So, the total number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

4. Simplifying the expression, we get \( x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

5. We know that at the third stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. So, we can set up the equation \( x + 6 = 20 \).

6. Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 20 - 6 = 14 \).

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

"Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.

1. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\).
2. He passes 14 out to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\).
3. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends: \(14 \times 2 = 28\). So, he now has \(8 + 28 = 36\).
4. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\).
5. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\).

So, Oscar has 31 lollipops."
"To fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, we need to calculate the time it takes to charge the remaining 40 percentage points.

The phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes. So, for 40 percentage points, the time required would be:

40 percentage points * 3 minutes per percentage point = 120 minutes

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

It will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."
"Erin starts with 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her another 10 lollipops, so she has:

"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. So, $80 / $20 = 4 rewards.

Now, for this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards. The rewards they have are $4, and the coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the coupon takes 2 * $4 = $8 off the price.

The total amount after applying the rewards and the coupon is $43 - $4 (rewards) - $8 (coupon) = $31.

So, the customer paid $31 on this shopping trip."
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A.

Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year, so the annual salary is:
\[ 15 \times 2000 = 30,000 \text{ dollars} \]

The state tax rate is 20%, so the tax amount is:
\[ 30,000 \times 0.20 = 6,000 \text{ dollars} \]

The net pay for Job A is:
\[ 30,000 - 6,000 = 24,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B.

Job B pays $42,000 a year. The state charges $6,000 in property tax, so the amount after property tax is:
\[ 42,000 - 6,000 = 36,000 \text{ dollars} \]

The state tax rate is 10%, so the tax amount is:
\[ 36,000 \times 0.10 = 3,600 \text{ dollars} \]

The net pay for Job B is:
\[ 36,000 - 3,600 = 32,400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we compare the net pay of the two jobs. Job B has a higher net pay of $32,400 compared to Job A's net pay of $24,000. The difference in net pay is:
\[ 32,400 - 24,000 = 8,400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Nick will make \(\boxed{8400}\) dollars more at the job with the higher net pay rate."
"First, we need to find out how many of the 220 castles in Scotland are ruins. Since 40 percent of them are ruins, we calculate:

220 castles * 40% = 220 * 0.40 = 88 ruined castles.

Next, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. Since half of the ruined castles are unmanned, we calculate:

88 ruined castles * 0.50 = 44 unmanned ruined castles.

So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland."

RJ (Richard) has 1 gun
Richard has 5 guns

Total guns = 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 guns

Now, they want to share these guns equally among the four of them. So, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people:

24 guns ÷ 4 people = 6 guns per person

Each of them would have 6 guns if they share equally."
"To find out how much sugar Mason needs, we can calculate the sugar required for the suckers and the fudge separately and then add them together.

For 8 batches of suckers:
- Each batch requires 30 ounces of sugar.
- So, for 8 batches, he needs \(8 \times 30 = 240\) ounces of sugar.

For 1 batch of fudge:
- Each batch requires 70 ounces of sugar.
- So, for 1 batch, he needs \(1 \times 70 = 70\) ounces of sugar.

Now, we add the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge:
- Total sugar needed = \(240 + 70 = 310\) ounces.

Therefore, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge."
"First, let's calculate the value of the shares after the first year. Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the initial total value is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price per share, we calculate:

\[ \$8 \times 1.50 = \$12 \]

So, the value of the 8 shares after the first year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. The new price per share is:

\[ \$12 \times 0.75 = \$9 \]

John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke."
"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group will then have \( x - 10 \) students.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can write the equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation, we get:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The smallest group has:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows. Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( 2C \).

Since the total number of animals is 60, we can write the equation:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, the number of cows is 20, and the number of chickens is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ 40 \text{ chickens} \times 2 \text{ legs per chicken} + 20 \text{ cows} \times 4 \text{ legs per cow} \]

So, Josh starts to juggle with 4 balls."
"The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.

Since the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the animals and the container:

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

The total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is 260 pounds."

"First, let's calculate how many cookies Jenny's son eats in a week. He gets 4 cookies 5 days a week, so:

\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Next, let's calculate how many cookies Jenny's husband eats in a week. He eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so:

\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 7 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Now, let's add the cookies eaten by her son and her husband to find out how many cookies are eaten by them in total:

\[ 20 \text{ cookies/week} + 7 \text{ cookies/week} = 27 \text{ cookies/week} \]

The total number of cookies in a bag is 36. To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we subtract the number of cookies eaten by her son and her husband from the total number of cookies in the bag:

So, Jenny eats 9 cookies. 

Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount. Each shirt costs $30, so for 2 shirts, the cost would be:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out how much the discount is. The discount is 40%, so we calculate 40% of $60:

\[ 0.40 \times 60 = 24 \]

Now, we subtract the discount from the original total cost to find out how much Davos paid:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

"First, let's calculate the daily earnings from tractors:

- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.

So, the daily earnings from tractors were:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Now, let's calculate the daily earnings from silos:

- They sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.

So, the daily earnings from silos are:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Next, we need to find the increase in earnings:

\[ \$1100 - \$1000 = \$100 \]

To find the percentage increase, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Increase in Earnings}}{\text{Original Earnings}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now."

To find out how much Andrea saved, we subtract the total amount spent and given away from the initial amount she had:

$36 - $15 = $21

Andrea saved $21."
"First, let's calculate the time John spent on each activity:

1. Boating: 6 hours
2. Swimming: Half the time spent boating, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) hours
3. Watching shows: 3 shows, each 2 hours, so \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) hours

Now, let's add up the time spent on these activities:
\[ 6 \text{ (boating)} + 3 \text{ (swimming)} + 6 \text{ (watching shows)} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. To find the total time, we can set up the equation:
\[ 0.30 \times \text{Total Time} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

Solving for the total time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to find out how much time he spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time John spent sightseeing is:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Annabelle earns from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so:

\[ 10 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 20 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much money she earns from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 15 \text{ hours} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add the money she already has in her savings, the money she earned from her first job, and the money she earned from her second job:

\[ 80 \text{ dollars} + 200 \text{ dollars} + 75 \text{ dollars} = 355 \text{ dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so to find out how much more money Annabelle needs to save, we subtract the total amount of money she has from the cost of the phone:

\[ 400 \text{ dollars} - 355 \text{ dollars} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Annabelle still needs to save:

\[ 45 \text{ dollars} \]"
"The shortest tree is 6 feet tall.

The second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so it is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

The combined height of the shortest and second trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined, so it is 17 * 2 = 34 feet tall.

The height of the tallest tree is 34 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the toy cars. Dean bought 6 toy cars at $2 each, so the total cost for the toy cars is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the teddy bears. Dean bought 5 teddy bears at $1 each, so the total cost for the teddy bears is:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find the total amount spent by Dean. The total cost of the toy cars and teddy bears is:
\[ 12 + 5 = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Dean's mother initially gave him $28. After spending $17, the amount of money Dean has left is:
\[ 28 - 17 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Dean's mother then gives him an extra $10. So, the total amount of money Dean has now is:
\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost for one round of mini-golf, the cost for the go-karts, and the cost for the arcade tokens, and then see how much money is left for the friends.

1. **Cost of one round of mini-golf:** $5
2. **Cost of go-karts (2 rides):** $10 per ride × 2 rides = $20
3. **Cost of arcade tokens:** $5

Now, let's add these costs together:
\[ 5 + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

This means that the total cost for Morgan and her friends to play one round of mini-golf, ride the go-karts twice, and have $5 in arcade tokens is $30.

Morgan has a budget of $90. We need to find out how much money is left after accounting for the fixed costs:
\[ 90 - 30 = 60 \]

This $60 is the amount of money left for the friends. If we assume each friend also needs to cover the same costs (one round of mini-golf, two rides on the go-karts, and $5 in arcade tokens), the cost per friend is also $30. Therefore, the number of friends Morgan can invite is:
\[ \frac{60}{30} = 2 \]

So, Morgan can invite 2 friends.

"Marisa gets $5 every day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops every day. So, the total cost of lollipops per day is:

4 lollipops * $0.25 per lollipop = $1.00

This means she spends $1.00 on lollipops each day. Therefore, the amount she saves each day is:

$5.00 - $1.00 = $4.00

If she saves for 5 days, the total amount she saves is:

$4.00 per day * 5 days = $20.00

So, the final numerical answer is:

$20.00"
"First, let's figure out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since gumballs cost $0.05 each and he bought 40 gumballs, the total cost for gumballs is:

\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

This means that before buying the gumballs, Billy had $2 more than what he spent on candy. Let's denote the amount of money Billy spent on candy as \( x \). Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the other half of his change is also $2. Therefore, the total change he had after buying candy is:

\[ 2 + 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

This means that the amount of money he had after buying candy is:

\[ 10 - x = 4 \]

From this equation, we can solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 10 - 4 = 6 \]

So, Billy spent $6 on candy. Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, the number of pounds of candy he bought is:

\[ \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \).

According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. Carver is 45 years old, so we can write the equation as:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels between the three cities in one trip.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs, which is \(75 + 100 = 175\) miles. So, the distance from the third city to the first city is \(175 - 50 = 125\) miles.

Now, let's find the total distance for one complete trip:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide 18,000 miles by the daily travel distance of 900 miles:
\[\frac{18000}{900} = 20\]

So, the train goes between services every \(\boxed{20}\) days."
"First, let's determine how much stuffing is needed for a collie bed. A collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. The average is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:

\[
4 \text{ chihuahua beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per bed} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:

\[
3 \text{ collie beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per bed} = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds:

\[
8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

So, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds."
"To calculate the total time John spent on his trip, we need to find the time for each leg of the journey and then sum them up.

1. **First Leg:**
   - Distance: 220 miles (200 miles to the friend's house + 10 miles detour)
   - Speed: 70 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 220 miles / 70 mph = 3.14 hours

2. **Second Leg:**
   - Distance: 240 miles
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

**Total Time:**
- Total Time = Time for first leg + Time for second leg = 3.14 hours + 3 hours = 6.14 hours

The trip took 6.14 hours."
"First, we need to find out how many fourth-grade boys are at Small Tree School in total. We know there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is:

96 (total students) - 43 (girls) = 53 (boys)

On Friday, 4 fourth-grade boys were absent. So, the number of boys present on Friday is:

53 (total boys) - 4 (absent boys) = 49 boys

So, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 49."
"There are 6 girls in the park. If there are twice the number of boys, then there are 6 * 2 = 12 boys in the park.

"To pass, Jane needs a total of at least 42 points from her three tests. She has already scored 15 points on the first test and 18 points on the second test. 

First, we add the points from the first two tests:
15 (first test) + 18 (second test) = 33 points

Now, we need to find out how many more points she needs to reach at least 42 points:
42 (total needed) - 33 (points already scored) = 9 points

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on her third test to pass.

The minimum number of points she must score on the third test to pass is 9."
"First, let's find out how many people were kicked out for shoplifting. We know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks. The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times that number minus 5. So, we calculate:

\[ 4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

Next, we need to find out how many people were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. This number is three times the number of shoplifters. So, we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we know the total number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence over goods on sale. Adding these together, we get:

\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

The total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is 50. Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:

\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost for the picture frames. Each picture frame costs $20, and there are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the picture frames is:

\[ 44 \times 20 = 880 \]

Next, we need to calculate the additional cost for etching the logo on each picture frame. The etching cost is 20% of the frame's cost, so for each frame, the etching cost is:

\[ 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \]

Therefore, the total etching cost for all 44 frames is:

\[ 44 \times 4 = 176 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost for the pins. There are 2 seniors who will receive pins, and each pin costs $5, so the total cost for the pins is:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost for the cords. One-fourth of the seniors are officers, so the number of officers is:

\[ \frac{44}{4} = 11 \]

Each cord costs $12, so the total cost for the cords is:

\[ 11 \times 12 = 132 \]

Finally, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent on the senior gifts:

\[ 880 + 176 + 10 + 132 = 1298 \]

So, the total amount spent on the senior gifts is:

\[ \boxed{1298} \]"

So, if Ethan made his own hand-painted wallpaper, the total cost would be $320."
"On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday, which is:
\[ 14 \times 2 = 28 \text{ pairs} \]

On the last day of the sale, they sold one-half the amount that they did on Saturday, which is:
\[ 28 \div 2 = 14 \text{ pairs} \]

However, six pairs were returned because they didn't fit, so the actual number of pairs sold on the last day is:
\[ 14 - 6 = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

To find the total number of pairs sold during the sale, we add the pairs sold on each day:
\[ 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \text{ pairs} \]

Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is:
\[ 50 \times 2 = 100 \text{ shoes} \]

Final numerical answer:

So, 15 sheep produce 1 kg of milk each, and 15 sheep produce 2 kg of milk each.

The total milk from the first half (15 sheep) is:
15 sheep * 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg

The total milk from the second half (15 sheep) is:
15 sheep * 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg

Adding both amounts together gives the total milk collected every day:

"First, we find out how many pupils like blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we calculate:

40 pupils / 2 = 20 pupils like blue.

Next, we find out how many pupils are left after accounting for those who like blue:

40 pupils - 20 pupils = 20 pupils.

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so we calculate:

20 pupils / 4 = 5 pupils like green.

The rest of the pupils like yellow. To find out how many that is, we subtract the number of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils:

40 pupils - 20 pupils (blue) - 5 pupils (green) = 15 pupils like yellow.

So, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is 15."
"First, let's find out how many apples Lucy sold on Monday. Since she got $56 from selling the apples at $4 per piece, we can calculate the number of apples sold on Monday by dividing the total amount by the price per apple.

\[ \text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{56}{4} = 14 \]

So, Lucy sold 14 apples on Monday.

Next, we know that on Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday. So, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is:

\[ \text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Now, we add up the number of apples picked over the three days:

\[ \text{Total number of apples picked} = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 \]

Therefore, Lucy picked a total of 50 apples over the three days."
"Lindsay started with 50 socks. She washed 10 pairs of socks, which is 20 socks, and 15 loose socks. So, she washed a total of 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

"To calculate the monthly payment, we need to consider the total amount Karan has to pay back, which includes the principal and the interest. The formula to calculate the total amount to be paid back is:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]

The interest can be calculated using the simple interest formula:

\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Principal (\(P\)) = $3,650
- Rate (\(R\)) = 10% or 0.10
- Time (\(T\)) = 5 months (which is \(\frac{5}{12}\) years, but for simplicity, we can use 5 months directly in the formula as the rate is annual)

First, calculate the interest:

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \]

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \]

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \]

\[ \text{Interest} = 152.085 \]

Now, add the interest to the principal to get the total amount:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.085 \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3802.085 \]

Since Karan has to pay this amount in 5 equal monthly installments, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.085}{5} \]

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.417 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.42 \]

So, Karan has to pay $760.42 per month."
"To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the distance each of them hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Cho hiked = 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 km

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Chloe hiked = 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 km

Now, we find the difference in the distances they hiked:
Difference = Distance Cho hiked - Distance Chloe hiked
Difference = 112 km - 45 km = 67 km

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos.

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos they have together.

For silver pesos:
- Axel: 50
- Anna: 100
- Total silver pesos: \(50 + 100 = 150\)

For gold pesos:
- Axel: 80
- Anna: 120
- Total gold pesos: \(80 + 120 = 200\)

Adding the total silver and gold pesos together:
- Total pesos: \(150 + 200 = 350\)

The total number of pesos they have together is 350."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She has 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, the total number of cups of lemonade is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine how much revenue Millie will generate from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue from selling 36 cups is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost of making the lemonade. Millie spent $18 on supplies. Therefore, her total cost is:

\[ \$18 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she sells all 36 cups, we need to determine how many hours it takes to sell all the lemonade. The total time to sell 36 cups at a rate of 4 cups per hour is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, to find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the total hours:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

So, the profit Millie makes per hour is:

\[ \$2 \]"
"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can follow these steps:

1. Let's assume the total land Mr. Ruther had initially is \( x \) hectares.
2. He sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, so he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left.
3. According to the problem, the remaining land is 12.8 hectares.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{5} x = 12.8 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]
\[ x = 32 \]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 52 * 50% = 52 * 0.5 = 26

The performance is done by the female members, so initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform. However, on the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, the number of girls who can't make it is:

Number of girls who can't make it = 26 * 0.5 = 13

Therefore, the number of girls who actually perform is:

Number of girls who perform = 26 - 13 = 13

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Total number of people who sang = Number of girls who perform + Number of teachers = 13 + 3 = 16

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the erasers and the pencils separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the erasers:
- Each eraser costs $2.
- We have 6 erasers.
- So, the total cost for the erasers is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pencils:
- Each pencil costs $3.
- We have 8 pencils.
- So, the total cost for the pencils is \(8 \times 3 = 24\) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the erasers and the pencils together:
- Total cost = cost of erasers + cost of pencils
- Total cost = \(12 + 24 = 36\) dollars.

Therefore, the total cost for 6 erasers and 8 pencils is 36 dollars."

"David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides. Dasha buys tickets for each ride, and since each ride costs 2 tickets at $2 per ticket, each ride costs her $4. For 9 rides, Dasha spends $4 x 9 = $36. 

David's cost is $30 for the bracelet, and Dasha's cost is $36 for the tickets. The difference in cost, which is how much David saves, is $36 - $30 = $6.

David saves $6."
"First, we need to find the total number of gifts Monica is wrapping. She has 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends, and 2 gifts for her teachers. Adding these together:

6 (family) + 4 (friends) + 2 (teachers) = 12 gifts

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to make bows for all 12 gifts. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total inches of ribbon by the number of gifts:

144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many popsicles each person has based on the given ratio and total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

First, we need to find the total parts of the ratio:
5 (Betty's part) + 6 (Sam's part) = 11 parts

Now, we know that these 11 parts together make up 165 popsicles. To find out how many popsicles one part represents, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
165 popsicles / 11 parts = 15 popsicles per part

Now, we can find out how many popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.
- Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
90 popsicles (Sam) - 75 popsicles (Betty) = 15 popsicles

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services before the bundle discount.

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu costs $10 a month.
- Disney Plus costs $10 a month.

So, the total cost for these three services before the discount is:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount for bundling these services. The discount amount is:
\[ 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we compare this to the cost of the cable package, which is $60 per month. The savings by cancelling the cable package and subscribing to the streaming services is:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 36 \]"
"First, let's calculate the time Carol spends on each activity:

- Writing a song: 4 hours
- Recording: half the time spent writing, which is 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
- Editing: 90 minutes, which is 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours

Now, let's find the total work time:

Total work time = 4 hours (writing) + 2 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7.5 hours

Next, we need to find what percentage of the total work time was spent editing. The time spent editing is 1.5 hours.

The percentage of time spent editing is calculated as:

(1.5 hours / 7.5 hours) * 100 = 20%

So, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing."
"First, we need to find out how many books can fit in the shelving system. The system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total number of spaces available is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books that can fit in the system. So, we need to calculate double the number of spaces and then add 20 to it:

\[ 2 \times 36 = 72 \]
\[ 72 + 20 = 92 \]

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry:

\[ 92 \]

books to complete her task."
"Erica initially made 20 Valentine's cards. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, each containing 15 cards. So, the total number of pre-made cards is:

2 boxes * 15 cards/box = 30 cards

Adding the cards Erica made to the pre-made cards:

20 cards + 30 cards = 50 cards

Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, so the total number of cards she passed out is:

24 cards + 5 cards = 29 cards

She also received 17 cards from family and friends. To find out how many cards Erica now has, we need to subtract the cards she passed out and add the cards she received:

50 cards - 29 cards + 17 cards = 38 cards

So, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards."
"First, let's calculate how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Next, Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. So:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices, so we subtract those from the total:
\[ 12 - 7 - 2 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the number of slices left is:
\[ 3 \]"
"Mark needs to save $300 - $50 = $250 more to buy the bike.

"First, let's find out how many millipedes Nancy saw. Since she saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, and she saw 90 spiders, we can calculate the number of millipedes as follows:

Number of millipedes = 1/3 * 90 = 30

Next, we need to find out how many stink bugs she saw. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, we calculate the number of stink bugs as follows:

Number of stink bugs = (2 * 30) - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48

Now, we add up all the bugs:

Total number of bugs = Number of spiders + Number of millipedes + Number of stink bugs
Total number of bugs = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168

"For a quadruple batch, Mark needs to multiply the normal recipe amounts by 4.

For flour:
- Normal recipe: 3 cups
- Quadruple batch: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
- Flour is sold in 2-cup bags
- Number of bags needed: 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags

For milk:
- Normal recipe: 1 cup
- Quadruple batch: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups
- Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles
- Number of bottles needed: 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles

To find how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy:
- Bags of flour: 6
- Bottles of milk: 2
- Difference: 6 - 2 = 4

Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

"First, let's calculate the energy used by the air conditioner per day before the reduction.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour and is used for 8 hours a day. So, the daily energy usage is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours/day} = 7200 \, \text{watts/day} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the daily energy usage to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts/day} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \]

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he will use it for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours/day} - 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 3 \, \text{hours/day} \]

The new daily energy usage is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours/day} = 2700 \, \text{watts/day} \]
Converting to kilowatts:
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts/day} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \]

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original and the new daily energy usage:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts/day} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts/day} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \]

To find out how much energy is saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

So, the total kilowatts of electric energy saved in 30 days is:
\[ 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]"
"First, let's count the stripes on each zebra:

- Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each, so that's \(2 \times 17 = 34\) stripes.
- There is a zebra with 36 stripes.
- Another zebra has half as many stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes, so that's \(36 \div 2 = 18\) stripes.

Now, let's add up all the stripes:
\[34 + 36 + 18 = 88\]

Next, we need to find the average number of stripes. There are 4 zebras in total, so we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
\[88 \div 4 = 22\]

So, the average number of stripes per zebra is 22."
"To make enough muffaletta sandwiches to serve 20 people, Tyson needs to make 20 / 4 = 5 sandwiches.

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.

So, for 5 sandwiches, he will need 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so for 5 pounds, he will spend 5 * $7.00 = $35.00.

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so for 5 pounds, he will spend 5 * $3.00 = $15.00.

Therefore, the total cost for the meat and cheese will be $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

He would spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people."
"Allan initially has 40 cannolis. Since there is twice as much corn as cannolis, he has 2 * 40 = 80 corns.

After buying 60 more cannolis, he has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.

Allan also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, so he bought 100 - 40 = 60 corns.

Adding the 60 corns to the initial 80 corns, he now has 80 + 60 = 140 corns.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 + 140 = 240.

"Elliott finished half of his 10,000 steps on his walks to and from school. So, he walked 5,000 steps.

He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total steps before his jog were 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. This means he had already taken 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps before his jog.

Therefore, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps.

"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book. The book is 45 pages long, and it averages 200 words per page. So, the total number of words is:

45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Next, we need to find out how long it will take Toby to read the book. Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute. So, the time it will take him to read the book is:

9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

Toby needs to be at the airport in 60 minutes, and it takes him 10 minutes to get there. So, he needs to leave 10 minutes before the 60 minutes to reach on time:

60 minutes - 10 minutes = 50 minutes

Since it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, he will leave 20 minutes before he needs to be at the airport:

50 minutes - 30 minutes = 20 minutes

So, Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, each earning $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. The weekly pay for one employee is:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 600 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Since there are 40 employees, the total weekly pay for all employees is:
\[ 600 \text{ dollars/week} \times 40 \text{ employees} = 24000 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Assuming the company operates for 4 weeks in May, the total amount paid in May is:
\[ 24000 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 96000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in June.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. So, the number of employees whose contracts expired is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ employees} \]

This means the number of employees remaining in June is:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ employees} \]

The weekly pay for one employee in June is still $600. Therefore, the total weekly pay for all employees in June is:
\[ 600 \text{ dollars/week} \times 30 \text{ employees} = 18000 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Assuming the company operates for 4 weeks in June, the total amount paid in June is:
\[ 18000 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 72000 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:
\[ 96000 \text{ dollars} + 72000 \text{ dollars} = 168000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" So, the first pound costs $3, and the second pound is half off, which means it costs $3 / 2 = $1.50. Therefore, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashells, which is $1.50.

Then, we calculate the cost of the magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25, and she bought 4 magnets, so the total cost for the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Taffy: $4.50
- Seashells: $1.50
- Magnets: $1.00

Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

Sally started with $10.00. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is:
$10.00 - $7.00 = $3.00

So, the final numerical answer is:
$3.00"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the second pack of fireworks. Since it's worth twice the first pack, we have:

\[ 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

Next, we add the cost of the first pack and the second pack to find the total cost before the discount:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Now, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the fireworks. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the original cost:

\[ 1200 \times 0.80 = 960 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

So, the total amount Tim spent is:

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many candles will both smell like wet dog and explode. 

First, we need to understand the given percentages:
- 5% of the candles are more dangerous and have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.
- Marcy guarantees that 99% of the candles will not explode, which means 1% of the candles are expected to explode.

Now, let's calculate the number of candles that are more dangerous and have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog:
- 5% of 50,000 candles = 0.05 * 50,000 = 2,500 candles.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 2,500 candles will explode. Since 1% of all candles are expected to explode, we can assume that 1% of the 2,500 more dangerous candles will also explode:
- 1% of 2,500 candles = 0.01 * 2,500 = 25 candles.

So, the final numerical answer is:
25 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode."
"First, we need to find the discount price of each blouse. Since the blouses are 30% off, we calculate 30% of $20.

So, the discount price of each blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so we need to find the total cost for 4 blouses at the discounted price.

Total cost = 4 * $14 = $56

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples.
- Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees, but we don't know the exact number yet.
- Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
- Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
- Joanne's sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.

Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as \(x\).

Now, we can calculate the total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister:

- Joanne's total: \(30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\)
- Joanne's sister's total: \(60 + 45 = 105\)

The combined total of apples gathered by both is 500:

\[45 + x + 105 = 500\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[150 + x = 500\]

Subtract 150 from both sides:

\[x = 500 - 150\]
\[x = 350\]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of heads is 180, which means \( C + D = 180 \).
2. The total number of bumps (humps) is 304, which means \( 2C + D = 304 \).

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + D = 180 \)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \)

To find the number of dromedaries, we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2C + D - C - D = 124 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we know \( C = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( D \):
\[ 124 + D = 180 \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( \boxed{56} \)."
"In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day. So, the total distance for the first 4 days is:
\[ 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \]

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first four days. So, the distance for the next two days is:
\[ 800 \, \text{km} \times 0.30 = 240 \, \text{km} \]

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is:
\[ 0 \, \text{km} \]

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days. So, the total distance for the second week is:
\[ 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \]

Adding all these distances together, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ 800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} = 3140 \, \text{km} \]

So, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:

"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the size of Zack's locker.
2. Use the size of Zack's locker to find the size of Timothy's locker.

First, we know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. So, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we know that Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. So, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2:

\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the size of Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"Stanley's comb fell from an elevation of 10,000 feet to a ledge at 6,000 feet (10,000 feet - 4,000 feet). Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To reach the comb, Oliver must climb from 3,000 feet to 6,000 feet.

To find out how many feet Oliver must climb, we subtract Oliver's current elevation from the elevation of the comb:

6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet

Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

3,000 feet"

4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats

After the boats took away the cats, the number of cats left on the rock is:
50 cats - 20 cats = 30 cats

Then, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. So, the number of cats that ran after the mouse is:
(3/5) * 30 cats = 18 cats

"The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. So, the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means he saved $6 / 3 = $2 from the jogger jeans and $6 - $2 = $4 from the tattered jeans.

The original price of the jogger jeans would be the sale price plus the savings, which is $22 + $2 = $24.

So, the original price of the jogger jeans was $24, and the original price of the tattered jeans was $28.

To find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we need to consider the original prices before the sale. The tattered jeans originally cost $28, and the jogger jeans originally cost $24. However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost, which is a bit confusing since the tattered jeans are more expensive. 

But if we consider the difference in the original prices before the sale, the tattered jeans were $28 and the jogger jeans were $24, so the tattered jeans originally cost $28 - $24 = $4 more than the jogger jeans.

However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost, which is $0 since the tattered jeans were more expensive.

The final numerical answer is:
$0"
"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles.

First, let's calculate the capacity of the buses:
- There are 4 buses, and each bus can hold 60 employees.
- So, the total capacity of the buses is \(4 \times 60 = 240\) employees.

Next, let's calculate the capacity of the minibusses:
- There are 6 minibusses, and each minibus can hold 30 employees.
- So, the total capacity of the minibusses is \(6 \times 30 = 180\) employees.

Then, let's calculate the capacity of the minivans:
- There are 10 minivans, and each minivan can hold 15 employees.
- So, the total capacity of the minivans is \(10 \times 15 = 150\) employees.

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles to get the total capacity for the day trip:
- Total capacity = capacity of buses + capacity of minibusses + capacity of minivans
- Total capacity = \(240 + 180 + 150 = 570\) employees.

So, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others, making a total of 6 bird feeders.

The store-bought bird feeders attract 20 birds each. Since the feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, her homemade feeders attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of birds attracted by each type of feeder:

- For the 3 store-bought feeders: 3 feeders * 20 birds/feeder = 60 birds
- For the 3 homemade feeders: 3 feeders * 30 birds/feeder = 90 birds

Adding these together, Lillian can expect to see 60 + 90 = 150 birds in her garden each day."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, which costs $4. 

To find 25% of $4:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the soup costs:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Next, the cake costs half of the price of the bagel. Since the bagel costs $4:
\[ \text{Cost of the cake} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, we add up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake to find the total cost of the dinner:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay:
\[ 11 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Kenny needs $100 to buy the ticket to the amusement park.
2. He plans to sell his Pokemon cards for $1.5 each.
3. He keeps 1/3 of the cards and has $50 in spending cash after selling the rest.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

- He keeps 1/3 of the cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards.
- The money he gets from selling \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \).

After selling the cards, he has $100 for the ticket and $50 in spending cash, which totals $150. Therefore, the money he gets from selling the cards is $150.

So, we have:
\[ x = 150 \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 150 cards."
"The caterer was supposed to prepare enough hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them getting two hotdogs. So, half of 36 is 18 guests who would get two hotdogs, and the other half would get one hotdog.

For the 18 guests who were supposed to have two hotdogs:
18 guests * 2 hotdogs = 36 hotdogs

For the other 18 guests who were supposed to have one hotdog:
18 guests * 1 hotdog = 18 hotdogs

Total hotdogs prepared:
36 hotdogs + 18 hotdogs = 54 hotdogs

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. That means each of the 40 guests would need 2 hotdogs.

Total hotdogs needed for 40 guests to have 2 each:
40 guests * 2 hotdogs = 80 hotdogs

The caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, so the number of hotdogs short is:
80 hotdogs - 54 hotdogs = 26 hotdogs

Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs to have a second one, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:
26 hotdogs / 2 hotdogs per guest = 13 guests

Final numerical answer:
13 guests did not get a second hotdog."
"First, we find half the number of letters in Indras' name. Indras' name has 6 letters, so half of that is 6 / 2 = 3 letters.

Next, we add 4 more letters to this half to find the number of letters in her sister's name. So, 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, we add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name together. Indras' name has 6 letters, and her sister's name has 7 letters, so 6 + 7 = 13 letters.

Final numerical answer:
13"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Now, add these amounts together to get the total before the discount:

$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Next, calculate the discount. The items are 20% off, so we need to find 20% of $165.00:

20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Now, subtract the discount from the total before the discount to get the final amount:

$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

So, the final amount of Charlotte's order is $132.00."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy. The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. Adding these together:

\[ 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 \]

So, the total cost of the items is $19.

Next, we need to determine how much money Dora has. She has saved $2 from her allowance and her mother gave her $16. Adding these amounts together:

\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]

So, Dora has $18.

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount of money she has from the total cost of the items:

\[ 19 - 18 = 1 \]

Therefore, Dora needs \(\boxed{1}\) more dollar to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, which is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \text{ dragons} \]

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, which is:
\[ 2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ dragons} \]

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \text{ dragons} \]

Prince Bruce has slain 30 dragons."
"First, we need to determine how much gas is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

15 gallons ÷ 5 = 3 gallons per container

Next, we need to find out how much gas Josey needs. Josey needs 1/4 of a container, so we calculate:

3 gallons/container × 1/4 container = 3/4 gallon

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so:

3/4 gallon × 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"First, let's calculate how much money George had left after buying the chips. He spent 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each, so:

\[ 3 \times 40 \text{ cents} = 120 \text{ cents} \]

Since George had 1% of his money left, the 120 cents represent 99% of the $5 he initially had. Let's convert $5 to cents to make the calculation easier:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars} = 500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we know that 99% of 500 cents is 120 cents. We can set up the equation to find the initial amount of money George had before spending:

\[ 0.99 \times \text{initial amount} = 120 \text{ cents} \]

Solving for the initial amount:

\[ \text{initial amount} = \frac{120}{0.99} \approx 121.21 \text{ cents} \]

Since George initially had 500 cents, and he spent 120 cents on chips, the remaining money he had before buying candy bars is:

\[ 500 \text{ cents} - 120 \text{ cents} = 380 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we need to find out how many candy bars he bought. Each candy bar costs 75 cents. Let's denote the number of candy bars he bought as \( x \). The total cost of the candy bars is:

\[ 75x \text{ cents} \]

The remaining money after buying the candy bars is:

\[ 380 \text{ cents} - 75x \text{ cents} \]

Since he had 1% of his initial money left, which is 5 cents (1% of 500 cents), we can set up the equation:

\[ 380 - 75x = 5 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 380 - 5 = 75x \]
\[ 375 = 75x \]
\[ x = \frac{375}{75} \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, he shared 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops with his friends. He has four friends, so we divide the 20 lollipops equally among them.

Each of his friends received 5 lollipops."
"Rory's cake weighs 20 ounces in total. She cuts it into 8 pieces, so each piece weighs:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} \]

Rory and her mom each have one piece, so they have taken 2 pieces in total. The weight of the pieces they have is:

\[ 2 \times 2.5 \text{ ounces} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the remaining cake weighs:

\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

15 ounces"
"First, let's find out the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have together. Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is:

34 + 22 = 56 oranges

Now, they want to share these oranges equally with their 6 other friends. Including Sitti and Juris, there are a total of 8 people (2 of them + 6 friends).

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of people:

56 ÷ 8 = 7 oranges per person

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine needs. He doubles the recipe, so he needs 2 pounds * 2 = 4 pounds of onions.

The cost of onions is $2.00 per pound, so for 4 pounds, the cost is 4 pounds * $2.00/pound = $8.00.

Next, the cost of beef stock: 2 boxes * $2.00/box = $4.00.

The total cost of ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 people = $2.00 per serving.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area of the room to find the width. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, so we can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{width} \]

\[ \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the room. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. So, she has a total of 3 packs of beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. So, she has a total of 7 packs of beads.

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

Elizabeth's total beads: \(3 \times 20 = 60\) pieces.
Margareth's total beads: \(7 \times 20 = 140\) pieces.

To find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth, we subtract Elizabeth's total from Margareth's total:

\(140 - 60 = 80\)

Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking**: Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour.
   - Temperature increase per hour = 5 degrees
   - Total hours baking = 3 hours
   - Total temperature increase = 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees
   - New temperature after baking = 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

3. **Cooling**: Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   - Cooling rate = 2 degrees/10 minutes
   - Total time the window is open = 30 minutes
   - Number of 10-minute intervals in 30 minutes = 30 minutes / 10 minutes = 3 intervals
   - Total temperature decrease = 2 degrees/interval * 3 intervals = 6 degrees
   - Final temperature = 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

The house's final temperature is 49 degrees."
"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, James's swim time is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. So, James's bike time is:
\[ 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Jon won by 10 minutes, so James's total time is:
\[ 170 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we can find out how long it took James to do the run by subtracting his swim and bike times from his total time:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} - 85 \text{ minutes} = 59 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it took James 59 minutes to do the run."
"First, let's find out the length of Movie C. Since Movie C is given in hours, we need to convert it to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

Movie C = 1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Now, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So:

Movie B = Movie C + 5 minutes = 75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. So:

Movie A = Movie B / 4 = 80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

Therefore, Movie A is 20 minutes long."
"First, we need to determine how far the horse runs in 30 minutes. Since the horse runs at 32 miles per hour (MPH), we can calculate the distance covered in 30 minutes (which is half an hour) as follows:

\[ \text{Distance} = 32 \, \text{MPH} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 16 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how much hay the horse eats. The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse will eat:

\[ \text{Hay consumed} = 16 \, \text{miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \, \text{bail per mile} = 8 \, \text{bails} \]

Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost of the hay is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \, \text{bails} \times 3 \, \text{dollars per bail} = 24 \, \text{dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:

\[ \text{Total money} = 6 \times 5 = 30 \, \text{dollars} \]

The change Michael will have after buying the hay is:

\[ \text{Change} = 30 \, \text{dollars} - 24 \, \text{dollars} = 6 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Rozanne uses 4 dozen eggs and 2 additional eggs. Since a dozen is 12, 4 dozen eggs equal 48 eggs. Adding the 2 additional eggs, she has a total of 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs. To find out how many glasses of eggnog she can make, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed per glass:

50 eggs ÷ 5 eggs/glass = 10 glasses

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, the number of trays Rozanne can put out is:

10 glasses ÷ 5 glasses/tray = 2 trays

Rozanne can put out 2 trays."
"First, let's calculate Joey's new score after his turn in Scrabble. Joey originally has 214 points and scores an additional 26 points.

\[ 214 + 26 = 240 \]

So, Joey's new score is 240 points.

Next, let's calculate Marcy's new score after her turn. Marcy originally has 225 points and scores an additional 10 points.

\[ 225 + 10 = 235 \]

So, Marcy's new score is 235 points.

Now, to find out by how many points Joey is winning, we subtract Marcy's new score from Joey's new score.

\[ 240 - 235 = 5 \]

Joey is now winning by 5 points."
"First, let's calculate the cost per sneaker. The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576, so the cost per sneaker is:

\[ \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars per sneaker} \]

Next, we calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday. The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each:

\[ 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many sneakers were sold to the department store. Since he sold 17 sneakers on Monday, the remaining sneakers are:

\[ 48 - 17 = 31 \text{ sneakers} \]

The revenue from selling these 31 sneakers to the department store at $25 each is:

\[ 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars} \]

The total revenue from all the sneakers sold is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the revenue from the department store:

\[ 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars} \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. The total cost is $576, so the profit is:

\[ 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the salesman's profit is:

\[ \boxed{539} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets that each had eight pieces:

4 packets * 16 pieces/packet = 64 pieces

Now, let's add the two totals together to find the total number of crayons Beatrice bought:

48 pieces + 64 pieces = 112 pieces

So, Beatrice bought a total of 112 colors of crayons."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Super Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $20
   - Popcorn with soda: $1 extra
   - Total cost with super ticket: $20 + $1 = $21

2. **Regular Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $12
   - Popcorn: $x (unknown)
   - Soda: $3
   - Total cost without super ticket: $12 + $x + $3 = $15 + $x

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - Therefore, the cost of the regular ticket option minus the cost of the super ticket option equals $2.
   - $15 + $x - $21 = $2
   - Simplify the equation: $15 + $x - $21 = $2
   - $x - $6 = $2
   - $x = $2 + $6
   - $x = $8

So, the regular price of the popcorn is $8."
"First, let's find the cost of filling one helium balloon on the first day. We know that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900. So, the cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons at the new price. The total cost for 170 balloons is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 170 \times 65 = 11050 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{11050} \]"
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance for each part of the trip:
- For the first part, the car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours. So, the distance is \(60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}\).
- For the second part, the car drives at 30 mph for 1 hour. So, the distance is \(30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}\).

Now, let's add the distances to get the total distance:
- Total distance = \(120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}\).

Next, let's calculate the total time taken:
- Total time = \(2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}\).

Finally, we can find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
- Average speed = \(\frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph}\).

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."
"Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. 

First, let's calculate the value of the sapphires she trades:
3 sapphires * $800 per sapphire = $2400

After the trade, she has 5 sapphires left:
5 sapphires * $800 per sapphire = $4000

The value of the 2 rubies she receives is:
2 rubies * $1200 per ruby = $2400

Now, let's add the value of the remaining sapphires and the rubies:
$4000 (remaining sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $6400

So, the total value of all her jewels is $6400."

"First, we need to calculate the volume of soil needed for one raised bed. The volume of a raised bed is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Width} \times \text{Length} \times \text{Height} \]

For one raised bed, the dimensions are 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. So, the volume of one raised bed is:

\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 32 \times 10 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bags of potting soil are required. Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost of the potting soil is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

So, the total cost of the potting soil is:

\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"First, let's find out how many green cards there are. If there are 15 red cards and there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we calculate the number of green cards as follows:

\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + (0.60 \times 15) \]

\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + 9 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many yellow cards there are. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:

\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Now, we add up all the cards:

\[ \text{Total number of cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} + \text{Number of yellow cards} \]

\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \]

So, the total number of cards is 78."

"First, let's find the total number of puppies from both Jennifer and Brandon.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. So, the total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

Next, let's find the total number of puppies that have spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. So, the total number of puppies with spots is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

To find the percentage of puppies that have spots, we use the formula for percentage:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

Now, let's calculate the value:
\[ \frac{7}{20} = 0.35 \]
\[ 0.35 \times 100 = 35 \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:
\[ 35\% \]

Final answer:
\[ 35\% \]"
"First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed the farmer is buying:

1. **Sugar Cubes**: 2 boxes at 1 pound each = 2 pounds
2. **Carrots**: 4 bags at 12 pounds each = 48 pounds
3. **Hay**: 42 bales at 75 pounds each = 3150 pounds
4. **Oats**: 20 sacks at 65 pounds each = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed:

\[ 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 \text{ pounds} \]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips the farmer needs, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number because even a fraction of a trip means an additional trip is needed.

\[ \frac{4500}{2250} = 2 \]

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"Grayson recycles 3 aluminum cans and 5 plastic bottles each week.

For the aluminum cans:
3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week

For the plastic bottles:
5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week

Total earnings per week:
6 cents (from cans) + 15 cents (from bottles) = 21 cents/week

21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents

Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month."
"First, let's find out how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

\[ \text{Toni's plants} = \text{Frederick's plants} + 60\% \times \text{Frederick's plants} \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 0.60 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 16 \]

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate the number of plants Shondra has as follows:

\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = \text{Toni's plants} - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 16 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 9 \]

So, Shondra has 9 plants."
"Leila gave Ali half of her $100, which is $50. 

Ali originally had $21. 

So, Ali now has $21 + $50 = $71.

Ali has $71 now."
"First, we need to calculate the tip amount. The tip is 1/5 of the amount she ordered, which is $15.

To find 1/5 of $15, we divide $15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15}{5} = 3 \]

So, the tip amount is $3.

Now, we add the tip to the original cost of the pizza to find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man:

\[ 15 + 3 = 18 \]

Therefore, the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man is $18."
"Finley started in first place. She fell back 5 spots, so she was in 6th place. Then she moved ahead 2 spots, so she was in 4th place. She then fell behind 3 spots, so she was in 7th place. Finally, she jumped ahead 1 spot to finish in 6th place.

Finley finished the race in 6th place."
"Miss Maria has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck, so she has a total of \(6 \times 25 = 150\) basketball cards. She also has five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box, so she has a total of \(5 \times 40 = 200\) baseball cards. In total, she has \(150 + 200 = 350\) cards. She keeps 50 cards for herself, so she gives away \(350 - 50 = 300\) cards to her students. If each student gets 10 cards, then the number of students she has is \(300 \div 10 = 30\).

Miss Maria has 30 students."
"First, let's calculate how much Becky paid for her apples.

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each:
\[ 20 \times 0.45 = 9.00 \text{ dollars} \]

After receiving a $1 discount, Becky paid:
\[ 9.00 - 1.00 = 8.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for her apples.

Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Kelly received a 10 percent discount on her total purchase. To find the discount amount:
\[ 10.00 \times 0.10 = 1.00 \text{ dollar} \]

So, after the discount, Kelly paid:
\[ 10.00 - 1.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky:
\[ 9.00 - 8.00 = 1.00 \text{ dollar} \]

Therefore, Kelly paid $1.00 more than Becky."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Sheets per room**: Each room has 2 sheets.
2. **Comforter per room**: Each room has 1 comforter.
3. **Pillow cases per room**: Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pillow cases.
4. **Towels per room**: Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so \(2 \times 4 = 8\) towels.

Now, let's calculate the total number of each type of laundry for one room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforters: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

Total laundry per room = \(2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15\)

For 80 rooms, the total laundry would be:
\(15 \times 80 = 1200\)

Final numerical answer:
1200"
"Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes. Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, he initially has 200 / 2 = 100 pairs.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs, so he now has 100 + 5 = 105 pairs.

On Wednesday, he gains 15 more pairs, making it 105 + 15 = 120 pairs.

On Friday, he gains another 30 pairs, so he has 120 + 30 = 150 pairs.

By Saturday, he has 150 pairs and then gets rid of 180 shoes. Since he has 150 pairs, he has 150 * 2 = 300 shoes.

After getting rid of 180 shoes, he has 300 - 180 = 120 shoes left.

Final numerical answer:
120"
"First, we need to find out how many cupcakes Mary can decorate with all her sprinkles. Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and she has 6 jars, we multiply 8 by 6:

8 cupcakes/jar * 6 jars = 48 cupcakes

Next, we need to determine how many pans of cupcakes she should bake. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold:

48 cupcakes / 12 cupcakes/pan = 4 pans

So, Mary should bake 4 pans worth of cupcakes. 

4 pans"
"First, let's find the cost of the piece of paper. The pen costs $2. Three times the price of the pen is 3 * $2 = $6. The piece of paper costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen, so it costs $6 - $1 = $5.

Now, let's add the cost of the pen and the piece of paper to find the total cost. The total cost is $2 + $5 = $7.

Theo gave the cashier $10. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount given to the cashier. So, the change Theo received is $10 - $7 = $3.

The amount of change Theo received is $3."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pencils at the start of the year. There are 30 students, and each student started with 10 pencils. So, the total number of pencils is:

\[ 30 \times 10 = 300 \]

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. So, the number of pencils used is:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \]

This means the number of pencils remaining after two months is:

\[ 300 - 60 = 240 \]

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. So, the number of pencils left is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80 \]

Therefore, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is:

\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. So, we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"First, we need to find the combined length of the remoras. Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the total length of the remoras is:

\[ 6 \text{ inches} \times 2 = 12 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to convert the shark's body length from feet to inches to make the units consistent. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the shark's body length in inches is:

\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents. The formula to find the percentage is:

\[ \left( \frac{\text{part}}{\text{whole}} \right) \times 100 \]

Here, the ""part"" is the combined length of the remoras (12 inches), and the ""whole"" is the shark's body length (120 inches). So, we have:

\[ \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{12}{120} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

Therefore, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"
"Let's denote the total number of students at that grade level as \( x \).

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have desktop computers. This means that one-fourth of the students do not have desktop computers. We know that 20 students do not have desktop computers. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{1}{4}x = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:

\[
x = 20 \times 4
\]

\[
x = 80
\]

So, the total number of students at that grade level is 80."

First, calculate the total number of days he can walk:
3 weeks * 4 days/week = 12 days

Now, divide the total minutes by the number of days to find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day:
240 minutes / 12 days = 20 minutes/day

So, Jason has to spend 20 minutes walking each day."
"To find out how many books Sarah bought, we divide the total amount spent by the price of each book:

\[ \text{Number of books} = \frac{\$300}{\$15 \text{ per book}} = 20 \text{ books} \]

Sarah gave an equal number of these books to her 4 kids. To find out how many books each child got, we divide the total number of books by the number of kids:

\[ \text{Books per child} = \frac{20 \text{ books}}{4 \text{ kids}} = 5 \text{ books per child} \]

Each child got 5 books."
"To find out how many kids aren't allergic to anything, we need to first figure out how many kids are allergic to at least one of the substances (dairy or peanuts).

We know that:
- 9 kids are allergic to dairy.
- 6 kids are allergic to peanuts.
- 3 kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts.

When we add the number of kids allergic to dairy and peanuts, we count the kids allergic to both twice. So, we need to subtract the number of kids allergic to both to avoid double-counting.

The number of kids allergic to at least one of the substances is:
\[ 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

Now, we know there are 32 kids in total. To find out how many kids aren't allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to at least one substance from the total number of kids:
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \]

So, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is:
\[ 20 \]"
"There are 3 groups of 200 employees each, so the total number of employees is 3 * 200 = 600 employees.

Each group has 7 tour guides, but since the question asks for the total number of people going on the tour, we do not include the tour guides in the total number of people. Therefore, the total number of people going on the tour is just the employees.

Total number of people going on the tour: 600

"First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel during the busy weekend. The normal price is $1500 per day, and it is 20% more expensive during the busy weekend.

To find 20% of $1500:
\[ 1500 \times 0.20 = 300 \]

So, the increased price per day is:
\[ 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Each ticket costs $5000, and there are two tickets:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

So, the total cost of the trip is:
\[ 15400 \]"
"Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint.

Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, so:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ tubes of blue paint} \]

Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ tubes of yellow paint} \]

To find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we add the tubes of blue and yellow paint:
\[ 2 + 9 = 11 \]

Jasper has 11 tubes of paint."
"The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains.

The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. So, we calculate its weight as follows:

\[
\text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \text{ grains} = 36 \text{ grains}
\]

Now, we add the weights of both pennies to find the combined weight:

\[

The combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains."
"To find out how much more Keegan and Tashay need to earn to reach their goal, we first add the amounts they have already earned:

Keegan's earnings: $83
Tasha's earnings: $91

Total earnings by 3 pm: $83 + $91 = $174

Their goal is to raise $200. So, we subtract the total earnings from their goal:

$200 - $174 = $26

They need to earn $26 more to reach their goal."
"First, let's determine how many songs Luri has on her player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we can calculate the number of songs Luri has as follows:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

So, Luri has 60 songs on her player.

Next, we need to find out how many more songs each can add to their players. Since each player can store up to 100 songs, we subtract the number of songs each currently has from 100.

For Gabriel:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]

For Luri:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]

Now, to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add to her player than Gabriel can add to his, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:
\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Therefore, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to her player than Gabriel can add to his."
"First, we need to find out how many oranges Stetson ate. Since he ate 2/5 of the oranges they picked, and they picked 60 oranges, we can calculate the number of oranges he ate as follows:

\[
\text{Number of oranges Stetson ate} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60
\]

\[
\text{Number of oranges Stetson ate} = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

Stetson ate 24 oranges. Since he gives up $10 for each orange he eats, the total amount of money he gave up is:

\[
\text{Total amount of money} = 24 \times 10 = 240
\]

So, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is $240."
"To find out how much Jillian's handbag cost, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of 3 times the cost of her shoes.
2. Subtract $20 from that amount to find the cost of her handbag.

First, we know that her shoes cost $80. So, 3 times the cost of her shoes is:
\[ 3 \times 80 = 240 \]

60 miles/week ÷ 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

So, James runs 6 hours a week."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of oats one horse consumes in a day. Since each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal and is fed twice a day, one horse eats:

\[ 5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of oats all four horses consume in a day. Since there are four horses, the total consumption is:

\[ 10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much oats the horses consume in five days. The total consumption over five days is:

\[ 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to determine how many bags are required to provide 200 pounds of oats. The number of bags needed is:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags} \]

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days."
"Jana has 27 puppies. Two thirds of these puppies are Pomeranians. So, the number of Pomeranians is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \]

Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians."
"To find the average highest temperature of these three countries, we need to add the highest temperatures together and then divide by the number of countries.

The highest temperature in Southlandia is -48 degrees Fahrenheit.
The highest temperature in Northlandia is 21 degrees Fahrenheit.
The highest temperature in Midlandia is -3 degrees Fahrenheit.

First, we add these temperatures together:
-48 + 21 + (-3) = -30

-30 / 3 = -10

The average highest temperature of these three countries is -10 degrees Fahrenheit."
"The toy car costs $12 and the child already has $4 saved. So, the remaining amount he needs to save is:

$12 - $4 = $8

If the child saves $2 each day, we can calculate the number of days it will take to save the remaining $8 by dividing the remaining amount by the daily savings:

$8 ÷ $2/day = 4 days

It will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money."
"Jaime has 64 eggs and 2 trays that can each hold 24 eggs. 

First, calculate the total capacity of the 2 trays:
2 trays * 24 eggs/tray = 48 eggs

$8 + $24 = $32.

Sally spends $32 in all."
"First, let's calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors before any discounts.

Each pack costs $4.00, so 2 packs would normally cost:
\[ 2 \times \$4.00 = \$8.00 \]

Since the razors are on sale with a ""buy one get one free"" offer, Heather only needs to pay for 1 pack to get the second one free. Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is:
\[ \$4.00 \]

Next, we apply the $2.00 coupon to the $4.00 cost:
\[ \$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00 \]

Now, we need to find the cost per razor. Since 2 packs contain 8 razors (4 razors per pack):
\[ 2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors/pack} = 8 \text{ razors} \]

The cost per razor is:
\[ \frac{\$2.00}{8 \text{ razors}} = \$0.25 \text{ per razor} \]

To convert this to cents:
\[ \$0.25 = 25 \text{ cents} \]

So, the cost per individual razor is:
\[ 25 \text{ cents} \]"
"First, let's determine the height of the shortest cheerleader, which is 60 inches. In a human pyramid, the shortest cheerleader would be at the top. The height of the human pyramid would be the height of this cheerleader since no other cheerleaders are mentioned to be added to this height.

The height of the human pyramid is 60 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

\[ \frac{60}{12} = 5 \]

So, the height of the human pyramid is 5 feet."
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour. She works for 8 hours each day. So, each day she walks:

"Let's break it down step by step.

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.
3. At that time, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now.

So, in four years, Angela will be 3 * 14 = 42 years old.

4. To find out how old Angela is right now, we subtract the four years from her future age.

Angela's current age = 42 - 4 = 38 years old.

Angela is currently 38 years old."
"Paul drives his car twice a day for 14 days. 

For the morning rides, he spends $6 each day. So, for 14 days, he spends:
\[ 6 \times 14 = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

For the afternoon rides, he spends $2 each day. So, for 14 days, he spends:
\[ 2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the costs of the morning and afternoon rides together, we get:
\[ 84 + 28 = 112 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Paul spent a total of $112 on driving his car during these two weeks."
"Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so Ashley brought a total of \(5 \times 10 = 50\) oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne brought \(50 + 20 = 70\) oranges.

Together, Ashley and Brianne brought \(50 + 70 = 120\) oranges.

Since one greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, the number of pies they can make is \(120 \div 3 = 40\).

They can make 40 greek orange pies."
"To find the number of guests where the two venues cost the same, we need to set up an equation for each venue's total cost and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests as \( x \).

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) where the costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]
Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20x \]
Divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( 10 \).

"Let's denote the number of insects David found as \(D\), the number of insects Bodhi found as \(B\), and the number of insects Lily found as \(L\).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \(L + D + B = 43\)
2. \(L = D + 7\)
3. \(D = \frac{1}{2}B\)

First, we can express \(B\) in terms of \(D\):
\[B = 2D\]

Now, we substitute \(L\) and \(B\) in terms of \(D\) into the first equation:
\[L + D + B = 43\]
\[(D + 7) + D + 2D = 43\]
\[4D + 7 = 43\]
\[4D = 36\]
\[D = 9\]

Now that we know \(D = 9\), we can find \(L\) and \(B\):
\[L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16\]
\[B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18\]

So, Lily found \(16\) insects.

"First, we need to calculate how much yarn Mariah used. Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, we can find out how many yards Mariah used by calculating 1/4 of 364:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards} \]

Next, we calculate how much yarn Mariah's grandma used. Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn. So, we find out how many yards she used by calculating 1/2 of 364:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma to find the total amount of yarn used:

\[ 91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards} \]

So, they used 273 yards of yarn altogether."

"Suzie bought four packs of gum in total. She bought two packs of strawberry gum and one pack each of grape and green apple gum.

Let's denote the cost of a pack of strawberry gum as \( x \) dollars.

The cost of a pack of grape gum is given as $2. The cost of a pack of green apple gum is half the cost of a pack of grape gum, which is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.

The total cost of all the gum packs is $7. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total cost as:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

Each pack of strawberry gum costs $2."
"Frederick should buy the 2 x 4 pieces of wood because they are cheaper. Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks and costs $4. With $24, he can buy 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood.

"First, we need to determine the total number of legs Mario's sled dogs have. Since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, we can calculate the total number of legs as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many pairs of snowshoes are required. Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we can calculate the number of pairs needed as follows:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs} \]

Finally, we need to calculate the total cost. Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost is:

"Janet takes two bus trips each day, and she does this five days a week. So, the total number of trips she makes in a week is:

2 trips/day * 5 days/week = 10 trips/week

The cost of each bus trip is $2.20. Therefore, the total cost of her bus trips for the week without a pass is:

10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $22.00/week

If she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, the cost of her bus trips for the week would be $20. To find out how much she would save, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of her trips without the pass:

$22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00

So, Janet would save $2.00 by buying a weekly bus pass."
"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. 

The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, but the farm only has 30 cows, so this part of the statement is not relevant to the actual number of cows on the farm.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's add up all the animals:
- The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 20 sheep.

So, the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo combined is:
40 (from the farm) + 20 (from the zoo) = 60 animals.

"Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought, we can find out how many Sophia bought by dividing the quantities Rose bought by 4.

For onions:
12 onions / 4 = 3 onions

For potatoes:
4 potatoes / 4 = 1 potato

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:
3 onions + 1 potato = 4 items

"Andy wants to lose 30 lbs. and needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound. So, the total calories he needs to burn is:

30 lbs. * 3500 calories/lb. = 105,000 calories

The time from December 31st to July 19th is approximately 6 months and 18 days, which is about 218 days.

To find out the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories by the number of days:

105,000 calories / 218 days ≈ 481.92 calories/day

So, Andy needs to have a calorie deficit of about 482 calories each day to reach his goal."
"Gerald earns $30 every day. There are 7 days in a week, so he earns $30 x 7 = $210 for the entire week.

He spent a total of $100.

He has $110 left."
"First, we need to calculate the total distance Hannah will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she runs 8 laps, we can find the total distance by multiplying the number of laps by the distance per lap:

\[ 8 \text{ laps} \times 0.25 \text{ km/lap} = 2 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to determine how much water Hannah needs to drink. Since she needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs, we can find the total amount of water by multiplying the total distance by the amount of water per kilometer:

\[ 2 \text{ km} \times 60 \text{ ml/km} = 120 \text{ ml} \]

So, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water.

"Julie spent 20% of $500 on clothes. That's 0.20 * $500 = $100 on clothes.

After buying clothes, she had $500 - $100 = $400 left.

Then, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs. That's 0.25 * $400 = $100 on CDs.

So, the amount of money Julie had left is $400 - $100 = $300.

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting \( H = 3L \) into the equation \( H + L = 120,000 \), we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house \( H \):
\[ H = 3L \]
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost is $90,000."
"Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each for $4. So, the total number of bags she bought is 8 packs * 5 bags/pack = 40 bags.

The total cost for the bags is 40 bags * $4/bag = $160.

She sold each bag for $8, so the total revenue from selling the bags is 40 bags * $8/bag = $320.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $320 - $160 = $160.

So, the profit Tara earned on her bags is $160."
"Joe throws 25 punches per minute. A fight lasts 5 rounds of 3 minutes each, so the total time is 5 * 3 = 15 minutes.

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has.

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. So, the total amount from the $10 bills is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount from the $20 bills is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Ali has:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister. So, the amount given to his sister is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

The remaining amount of money Ali has after giving half to his sister is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is:
\[ 32 \text{ dollars} \]"
"First, we need to convert Rob's time into minutes. Rob takes 2 hours, and since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Rob takes \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes to shingle a house.

Next, we need to calculate double the time Rob takes. Double the time is \(2 \times 120 = 240\) minutes.

Royce takes 40 minutes more than double Rob's time. So, we add 40 minutes to 240 minutes. This gives us \(240 + 40 = 280\) minutes.

Therefore, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house."

"On Monday, Chris completes 12 problems. 

On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is \(3 \times 12 = 36\) problems.

So, by the end of Tuesday, he has completed \(12 + 36 = 48\) problems.

The total number of problems is 100, so the number of problems left after Tuesday is \(100 - 48 = 52\).

On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining problems, which is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 52 = 13\) problems.

So, by the end of Wednesday, he has completed \(48 + 13 = 61\) problems.

Therefore, the number of problems left for Thursday is \(100 - 61 = 39\).

"First, let's figure out how many quarts each person can pick per hour.

Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby can pick:
6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries as Bobby, so Kathy can pick:
2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky can pick:
10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up the total number of quarts they can pick per hour together:
Tony (6) + Bobby (5) + Kathy (10) + Ricky (8) = 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 quarts per hour.

So, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is 29."
"The bakers started with 200 loaves of bread.

- They sold 93 loaves in the morning.
- They sold 39 loaves in the afternoon.
- A grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves.

First, calculate the total number of loaves sold:
93 (morning) + 39 (afternoon) = 132 loaves sold.

Subtract the loaves sold from the initial amount:
200 (initial) - 132 (sold) = 68 loaves left.

Then add the returned loaves:
68 (left) + 6 (returned) = 74 loaves.

So, they had 74 loaves of bread left.

"First, we need to determine how many rows of red tulips Jackson can plant. Since he can fit 6 red tulips in a row and he has 36 red tulips, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips per row:

36 red tulips / 6 tulips per row = 6 rows of red tulips

Next, we calculate the number of rows of blue tulips. Since he can fit 8 blue tulips in a row and he has 24 blue tulips, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips per row:

24 blue tulips / 8 tulips per row = 3 rows of blue tulips

Now, we add the number of rows of red tulips and the number of rows of blue tulips to find the total number of rows:

6 rows of red tulips + 3 rows of blue tulips = 9 rows of flowers

Therefore, Jackson will plant 9 rows of flowers."
"Heather has 27 cups of raisins in total. She wants to divide these equally among making oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix. This means each category will get:

"First, let's calculate Ada's current daily electric consumption and cost.

Ada's current daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. If we assume she uses this for 24 hours a day, her daily consumption is:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh} \times 24 \, \text{hours} = 288 \, \text{kWh} \]

The cost per kilowatt-hour is $1.50, so her daily cost is:
\[ 288 \, \text{kWh} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$432 \]

Now, let's calculate her weekly cost before adding the new device. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ \$432 \times 7 = \$3024 \]

Next, let's calculate her new daily consumption after adding the device. The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour, so her new daily consumption is:
\[ (12 + 2) \, \text{kWh} \times 24 \, \text{hours} = 14 \, \text{kWh} \times 24 \, \text{hours} = 336 \, \text{kWh} \]

The new daily cost is:
\[ 336 \, \text{kWh} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$504 \]

Now, let's calculate her new weekly cost:
\[ \$504 \times 7 = \$3528 \]

Finally, the difference between her weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device is:
\[ \$3528 - \$3024 = \$504 \]

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is:

"First, let's figure out how long it takes one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take them 10 days to paint a whole house.

Now, if one person takes 10 days to paint a whole house, we can calculate how much of the house 5 people can paint in one day. Since 5 people working together would be 5 times as efficient, they can paint a whole house in 10 days / 5 = 2 days.

To find out how many hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we need to convert the 2 days into hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"Ophelia has 20 sofas. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

"First, let's determine Jame's current age. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, then his current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\).

Next, we need to find out how old Jame will be in 8 years. In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\).

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, we calculate twice Jame's age in 8 years and then subtract 5:
\[2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55.\]
This means that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 55 years old.

To find out Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55:
\[55 - 8 = 47.\]

Now, we need to find out how many years separate Jame's current age from his cousin's current age:
\[47 - 22 = 25.\]

So, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Errol paid $1,100 for the computer. The printer cost $400 less than the computer, so the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

The total cost for the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We can subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from this total to find the cost of the 2 monitors.

$2,400 - $1,100 (computer) - $700 (printer) = $600

This $600 is the total cost for the 2 monitors. To find the cost of one monitor, we divide this amount by 2.

"To solve this, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of days in April**: April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves**: The first half of April has 15 days, and the second half also has 15 days.

3. **Define the daily savings for the first half**: Let's say Elvis saves $x$ dollars each day in the first half of April. Therefore, for 15 days, he saves a total of $15x$ dollars.

4. **Define the daily savings for the second half**: According to the problem, Elvis saves twice as much each day in the second half. So, he saves $2x$ dollars each day in the second half. For 15 days, he saves a total of $15 \times 2x = 30x$ dollars.

5. **Set up the equation for the total savings**: The total savings for the month of April should be $1125. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   15x + 30x = 1125
   \]

6. **Solve for \(x\)**:
   \[
   45x = 1125
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25

7. **Calculate the daily savings for the second half**: Since \(x = 25\), the daily savings for the second half is \(2x = 2 \times 25 = 50\).

So, Elvis has to save $50 each day in the second half of the month.

**Final Answer**: Elvis has to save $50 each day in the second half of the month."

So, Daniel has to spend $27.00 on all the items he wants to buy."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Carly ordered.

- The cost of the hamburgers: \(5 \text{ hamburgers} \times \$4 \text{ each} = \$20\)
- The cost of the packs of potato fries: \(10 \text{ packs} \times \$0.30 \text{ each} = \$3\)
- The cost of the cans of fruit drinks: \(5 \text{ cans} \times \$2 \text{ each} = \$10\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost:
\[
\$20 + \$3 + \$10 = \$33
\]

Carly gives a fifty-dollar bill, so we need to find out how much change she gets back:
\[
\$50 - \$33 = \$17
\]

Therefore, the change Carly gets back is:
\[
\$17

"First, we calculate the commission for the first $1000 of sales. At 30%, the commission is:
\[ 1000 \times 0.30 = 300 \]

Next, we calculate the commission for the sales over $1000. Since Antonella sold $2500 worth of goods, the amount over $1000 is:
\[ 2500 - 1000 = 1500 \]
The commission for this amount is 10%, so:
\[ 1500 \times 0.10 = 150 \]

Now, we add the two commissions together to find the total amount Antonella earned:
\[ 300 + 150 = 450 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Antonella earned is:
\[ 450 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many water bottles Bill already has. He has 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he has is:

2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

Next, we need to find out how many bottles Bill wants to have for his guests. He has 70 guests and wants to provide 2 bottles per guest. So, the total number of bottles needed is:

70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

Now, to find out how many additional bottles Bill needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs:

140 bottles needed - 48 bottles he has = 92 additional bottles

So, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water."
"First, let's figure out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does in cold water. In cold water, he swims a mile in 16 minutes. So, twice that time is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes. Adding 2 minutes to that gives us \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes for a mile in warm water.

Next, we calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in each condition.

In cold water, it takes him 16 minutes per mile. So, for 3 miles, it would be \(16 \times 3 = 48\) minutes.

In warm water, it takes him 34 minutes per mile. So, for 3 miles, it would be \(34 \times 3 = 102\) minutes.

To find out how much longer it takes him to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day, we subtract the time it takes in cold water from the time it takes in warm water. That is \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."
"First, let's calculate how much John earns in a day. He earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so:

\[ 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \]

Next, we calculate how much he earns in a week. He works 4 days a week, so:

\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:

\[ \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."
"You pay $40 for the foot-long fish sub. The six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs three times that amount, so it costs 3 * $40 = $120.

"First, let's find out how many buttons had four holes. We know there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have two holes. So, the number of buttons with four holes is:

21 (total buttons) - 7 (buttons with two holes) = 14 (buttons with four holes)

Now, let's calculate the total number of holes:

- For the buttons with two holes: 7 buttons * 2 holes = 14 holes
- For the buttons with four holes: 14 buttons * 4 holes = 56 holes

Adding these together gives us the total number of holes:

14 (holes from two-hole buttons) + 56 (holes from four-hole buttons) = 70 holes

So, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70."
"Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so we calculate its size as follows:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 \text{ cubic inches} = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, so we calculate its size as follows:

\[ \text{Peter's locker size} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \text{ cubic inches} = 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches."
"Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, which is 2 cups (since the daily recommendation is 4 cups).

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks \(10 \times 2 = 20\) cups of coffee daily.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by \(20 - 4 = 16\) cups.

"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of hamsters:
- There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each.
- So, the total number of hamsters is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Next, let's calculate the number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- So, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to get the total number of rodents:
- Total number of rodents = Number of hamsters + Number of guinea pigs
- Total number of rodents = \(30 + 15 = 45\).

Therefore, the pet shop had a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's find Susan's weight. Since Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, and Mark weighs 150 pounds, we can calculate Susan's weight as follows:

Susan's weight = Mark's weight - 20 pounds
Susan's weight = 150 pounds - 20 pounds
Susan's weight = 130 pounds

Next, we need to find Bob's weight. Since Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, we can calculate Bob's weight as follows:

Bob's weight = 2 × Susan's weight
Bob's weight = 2 × 130 pounds
Bob's weight = 260 pounds

Now, to find the average weight of the three friends, we add their weights together and divide by 3:

Total weight = Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight
Total weight = 150 pounds + 130 pounds + 260 pounds
Total weight = 540 pounds

Average weight = Total weight / Number of friends
Average weight = 540 pounds / 3
Average weight = 180 pounds

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground. The sun moves 5 degrees an hour straight upward. Over 10 hours, the sun will move:

\[ 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \]

Starting from 32 degrees, after 10 hours, the angle from the ground to the sun will be:

\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the final answer is:

"The first son is 12 years old. The second son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old. The total number of candles needed is 12 + 8 = 20 candles. A pack of 5 candles costs $3, so the number of packs needed is 20 / 5 = 4 packs. Therefore, the total cost is 4 packs * $3/pack = $12. 

James spends $12 on candles."
"First, let's calculate how many minutes Judy read each night in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night and there are 7 nights in a week, she read for a total of \(15 \times 7 = 105\) minutes in the first week.

Next, we need to find out how many pages she read in the first week. Given that she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the reading speed as \(\frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4 \text{ pages}}{3 \text{ minutes}}\). Therefore, in 105 minutes, she read \(\frac{4}{3} \times 105 = 140\) pages.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week and the second week: \(140 + 100 = 240\).

So, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is 240."
"Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, so he ate \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) sandwiches.

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, so he ate \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \) sandwiches.

Together, they ate \( 4 + 3 = 7 \) sandwiches.

So, the number of sandwiches left is \( 12 - 7 = 5 \).

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

Given:
- Shiloh's current age, \( S = 44 \) years.
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( 44 + 7 = 51 \) years.

Let's denote the nephew's age in 7 years as \( N + 7 \).

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age:
\[ 51 = 3 \times (N + 7) \]

Now, solve for \( N \):
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.

For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave $1.00 for each tooth. So, for three teeth, the tooth fairy gave:
\[ 3 \times 1.00 = 3.00 \]

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of money per tooth as for the previous three teeth. Since the previous amount was $1.00, half of that is $0.50. So, for two teeth, the tooth fairy gave:
\[ 2 \times 0.50 = 1.00 \]

Adding all the amounts together:
\[ 5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00 \]

So, the tooth fairy left Sharon a total of $9.00."
"Richie scored 80 goals.

Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can find out how many goals Mark scored by subtracting 20 from Richie's total:
\[ \text{Mark's goals} = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna, so we can find out how many goals Anna scored by subtracting 45 from Richie's total:
\[ \text{Anna's goals} = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add up the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:
\[ \text{Total goals} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

"To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made compared to Liam, we need to calculate the total earnings for both of them and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate Mitchell's earnings:
- Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each.
- So, Mitchell's total earnings = 21 lemonades * $4/lemonade = $84.

Next, we know Liam's earnings:
- Liam made $63.

Now, we find the difference between Mitchell's and Liam's earnings:
- Difference = Mitchell's earnings - Liam's earnings = $84 - $63 = $21.

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam that weekend."
"Peter has $70 to spend over one week, which is 7 days. He spends an equal amount each day, so he spends $70 / 7 = $10 each day.

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spends his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. That's 4 days. So, he spends 4 days * $10/day = $40 on wooden action figures. Since each wooden action figure costs $5, he buys $40 / $5 = 8 wooden action figures.

After Wednesday, he has $70 - $40 = $30 left. For the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. He has 4 days left, so he can spend $10 each day, which totals $40. With $30 left, he can buy $30 / $2 = 15 plastic action figures.

In total, by the end of the week, Peter will have 8 wooden action figures + 15 plastic action figures = 23 action figures.

"Ford grows 40 roses every week. The flower shops order a total of 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses per week. 

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to know the number of weeks in a month. Typically, a month is considered to have about 4 weeks.

So, in a month, Ford grows 40 * 4 = 160 roses.
The flower shops order 65 * 4 = 260 roses in a month.

Therefore, Ford lacks 260 - 160 = 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

"Katina removes $100 from her savings account every month. There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are 24 months.

To find out how much she removes in 2 years, we multiply the monthly amount by the number of months in 2 years:
$100 * 24 = $2400

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from her initial savings:
$3000 - $2400 = $600

After 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her savings account."
"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total cost and the total revenue, then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

1. **Calculate the cost of bread:**
   - Each loaf of bread costs $3.00 and makes 10 sandwiches.
   - Therefore, the cost of bread per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30.

2. **Calculate the total cost of bread for 10 sandwiches:**
   - Since each sandwich costs $0.30 in bread, 10 sandwiches will cost 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

3. **Calculate the total cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches:**
   - The cost is $30.00 for 10 sandwiches.

4. **Calculate the total cost for 10 sandwiches:**
   - Total cost = Cost of bread + Cost of cheese and condiments
   - Total cost = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00.

5. **Calculate the total revenue for 10 sandwiches:**
   - They sell each sandwich for $7.00.
   - Therefore, the total revenue for 10 sandwiches is 10 * $7.00 = $70.00.

"First, let's calculate the total number of crayons Kate has. She has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each, so:

\[ 3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ crayons} \]

Next, we need to determine how many crayon muffins Kate can make. Since she uses 8 small pieces of crayon for each muffin, we divide the total number of crayons by 8:

\[ 192 \div 8 = 24 \text{ muffins} \]

Now, if Kate sells each muffin for $1.50, we can calculate the total amount of money she can make by multiplying the number of muffins by the price per muffin:

\[ 24 \times 1.50 = 36 \]

So, Kate can make $36."
"First, let's calculate the area of the bedroom. The area is found by multiplying the length by the width, so:

\[ \text{Area} = 18 \, \text{feet} \times 12 \, \text{feet} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the new carpet, including the padding. The cost per square foot for the carpet and padding is:

\[ \text{Cost per square foot} = \$12 + \$2 = \$14 \]

So, the total cost for the carpet and padding is:

\[ \text{Total cost for carpet and padding} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \times \$14 = \$3024 \]

Now, we calculate the cost for removing the old carpet. The contractor charges $4 per square foot for removal, so:

\[ \text{Cost for removal} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \times \$4 = \$864 \]

Finally, we calculate the cost for installing the new carpet. The contractor charges $34 per square foot for installation, so:

\[ \text{Cost for installation} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \times \$34 = \$7344 \]

To find the total cost, we add the cost for the carpet and padding, the cost for removal, and the cost for installation:

- Day 1 and Day 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Day 4 and Day 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

Now, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days:

Average number of birds per day = Total number of birds / Number of days
Average number of birds per day = 280 / 7
Average number of birds per day = 40

So, Mack saw an average of 40 birds per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Diane starts with a number, which is 20.
2. She adds half of this number to it. Half of 20 is 10, so we add 10 to 20, which gives us 30.
3. Next, she divides this result by 5. So, 30 divided by 5 is 6.
4. Then, she multiplies this result by the starting value minus 12. The starting value is 20, so 20 minus 12 is 8. Now, we multiply 6 by 8, which gives us 48.

So, the final value of the number train is 48."

"Herb's house is worth $76,000. Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's. To find the value of Juan's house, we first calculate 30% of $76,000.

30% of $76,000 = 0.30 * $76,000 = $22,800

Now, we subtract this amount from the price of Herb's house to find the price of Juan's house.

$76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

So, Juan's house is worth $53,200.

To find the combined value of the two houses, we add the value of Juan's house to the value of Herb's house.

$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy brought. Judy brought 24 dishes, so her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups brought by both Judy and her friend is 12 (Judy's cups) + 40 (friend's cups) = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes brought by both Judy and her friend is 24 (Judy's dishes) + 44 (friend's dishes) = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils brought by the two is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120 utensils.

"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount. 

To find the discount amount:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the discounted price of one box is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost will be:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes will contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per contact is $1.00. Since the question asks for the cost per pair of contacts, and assuming a pair is two contacts, the cost per pair would be:
\[ 1.00 \times 2 = 2.00 \]

Final numerical answer:

So, John earned $40 more than Jill."
"First, we need to calculate the total calories Hannah burns from aerobics and running.

For aerobics:
- She burns 500 calories/hour.
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 500 calories/hour * 2 hours = 1000 calories.

For running:
- She burns 600 calories/hour.
- She spends 1 hour running.
- Total calories burned from running = 600 calories/hour * 1 hour = 600 calories.

Now, we add the calories burned from both activities:
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories (aerobics) + 600 calories (running) = 1600 calories.

Next, we calculate the amount of water Hannah needs to drink based on the calories burned. She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned.

- Water needed = (Total calories burned / 200 calories) * 100 ml
- Water needed = (1600 calories / 200 calories) * 100 ml
- Water needed = 8 * 100 ml
- Water needed = 800 ml

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the note, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans. So, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) can be expressed as:
\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]

Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. So, the number of green jelly beans \( G \) can be expressed as:
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]
Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \), we get:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]
Solving for \( B \), we get:
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

So, the number of more green jelly beans than red jelly beans is:

To find the average of these three measurements, we add them together and then divide by 3:

(47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52 WPM

The average of the three measurements is 52 WPM."
"To find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and donuts for breakfast, we need to calculate the weight change for each option and then find the difference.

1. **Cheerios:**
   - Weight loss per week: 1.25 pounds
   - Over 5 weeks: \(1.25 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 6.25 \text{ pounds}\)

2. **Donuts:**
   - Weight gain per week: 1.75 pounds
   - Over 5 weeks: \(1.75 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds}\)

3. **Difference in weight:**
   - Weight gain from donuts: 8.75 pounds
   - Weight loss from Cheerios: -6.25 pounds
   - Difference: \(8.75 \text{ pounds} - (-6.25 \text{ pounds}) = 8.75 \text{ pounds} + 6.25 \text{ pounds} = 15 \text{ pounds}\)

The difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating donuts and Cheerios for breakfast is 15 pounds."
"First, let's calculate the number of people invited via email. Alex invited 100 people, and each of these people will also invite 2 friends. So, the total number of people invited via email and their friends is:

100 (initial invites) + 100 * 2 (friends of the initial invites) = 100 + 200 = 300 people.

Next, Alex calls 10 of her friends and invites them. So, that adds 10 more people:

300 (from email invites and their friends) + 10 (called friends) = 310 people.

Out of these 10 friends, 8 will be bringing their spouses. So, we need to add 8 more people for the spouses:

310 (total so far) + 8 (spouses) = 318 people.

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats."
"The Affenpinscher weighed 10 pounds.

The Dachshund weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so:
\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ pounds} \]

The Papillon weighed one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so:
\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

The Mastiff weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so:
\[ 5 \times 44 = 220 \text{ pounds} \]

The Mastiff weighed 220 pounds."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the boots on Amazon.com. The boots cost $16 and the shipping costs $4. So, the total cost on Amazon.com is:

\[ 16 + 4 = 20 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the boots on eBay. The boots cost $13 and the shipping costs twice as much as it does on Amazon. Since the shipping on Amazon is $4, the shipping on eBay is:

\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

So, the total cost on eBay is:

\[ 13 + 8 = 21 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon. We subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay:

\[ 21 - 20 = 1 \]

So, the boots are \(\boxed{1}\) dollar more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand how the height of the beanstalk changes over time. The beanstalk starts at 4 feet tall and doubles in height every day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than 20 feet.

Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk day by day:

- Day 0: 4 feet
- Day 1: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
- Day 2: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
- Day 3: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

On Day 3, the beanstalk reaches 32 feet, which is taller than 20 feet. Therefore, it takes 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

Final answer:
3"
"First, let's determine how much protein John gets from 200 grams of mushrooms per day. Since 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein, 200 grams would contain twice as much protein because 200 grams is double 100 grams.

So, 200 grams of mushrooms would contain:
\[ 3 \, \text{grams} \times 2 = 6 \, \text{grams of protein} \]

Next, we need to find out how much protein John gets in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7:
\[ 6 \, \text{grams/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 42 \, \text{grams/week} \]

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms daily."
"Let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's say Jerry's current age is \( x \) years.
2. Five years ago, Jerry's age was \( x - 5 \) years.
3. According to the problem, Jerry is currently twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation: \( x = 2(x - 5) \).

Now, let's solve the equation:

\[ x = 2(x - 5) \]
\[ x = 2x - 10 \]
\[ x - 2x = -10 \]
\[ -x = -10 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old.

4. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

1. The base price for 2 implants is $2000 each, so:
   \[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

2. For one of the implants, there is an extra cost for a porcelain crown, which is $500. So, the total cost for the dental work is:
   \[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

3. George has already put down a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
   \[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

4. George makes $15 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
   \[ 3900 \div 15 = 260 \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees.

According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 2x \) degrees.

Another angle is three times the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Colby has in each type of coin:

- Quarters: 8 quarters × $0.25 = $2.00
- Dimes: 6 dimes × $0.10 = $0.60
- Nickels: 14 nickels × $0.05 = $0.70
- Pennies: 15 pennies × $0.01 = $0.15

Now, let's add up all the money Colby has:

$2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45

Since each gumball costs a nickel ($0.05), we can find out how many gumballs Colby can buy by dividing the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:

$3.45 ÷ $0.05 = 69

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"To find the total number of legs the pets in the store have, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

- Dogs: 5 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 20 legs
- Cats: 2 cats * 4 legs/cat = 8 legs
- Birds: 10 birds * 2 legs/bird = 20 legs

Adding these together gives us the total number of legs:

20 legs (from dogs) + 8 legs (from cats) + 20 legs (from birds) = 48 legs

So, the total number of legs the pets in the store have is 48."
"Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He increases the weight by 50%. 

To find the new weight, we calculate 50% of 8 pounds:
50% of 8 = 0.50 * 8 = 4 pounds

Adding this to the original weight:
8 + 4 = 12 pounds

The new weight is 12 pounds, but it turns out to be too heavy. So, he uses a weight that is 2 pounds lighter than 12 pounds.

12 - 2 = 10 pounds

The weight that he now uses is 10 pounds."
"Steve starts with 5 games for his birthday. 

For the first year, he buys 1 game per month, so that's 12 games. 
For the second year, he buys 2 games per month, so that's 24 games. 
For the third year, he buys 4 games per month, so that's 48 games. 

He also gets 5 games for Christmas every year, so that's 5 games for each of the 3 years, which totals 15 games.

Now, let's add everything up:

5 (initial games) + 12 (first year) + 24 (second year) + 48 (third year) + 15 (Christmas games) = 104 games.

So, after 3 years, Steve has 104 games."
"First, we need to find the speed of the plane. The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. So, the speed of the plane is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. Using the formula for time:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles.

"First, let's find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour

Now, Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz does. So, we calculate Marissa's hourly production as follows:

60 pounds * 3/4 = 45 pounds per hour

If they worked for 12 hours in a day, we can calculate the total amount of chocolate they made together by adding their hourly production and then multiplying by the number of hours worked.

Ruiz's total production in 12 hours:
60 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds

Marissa's total production in 12 hours:
45 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 540 pounds

Now, we add both totals to find the combined production:
720 pounds + 540 pounds = 1260 pounds

So, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is 1260 pounds."
"On Monday, Howard spends $8.

On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.

On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he spent on Tuesday, which is \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

The total amount spent over the three days is \(8 + 16 + 64 = 88\) dollars.

If Howard originally had $100, the amount of money he has left is \(100 - 88 = 12\) dollars.

"First, let's calculate how much money Patrick earned in the first four hours. He sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup.

For the first four hours:
15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup * 4 hours = $30

Next, let's calculate how much money he earned in the next two hours. He sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.

For the next two hours:
10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup * 2 hours = $12

Now, let's add the earnings from both periods to find the total amount of money Patrick earned.

Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42

Patrick earned $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"To find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations per tire for Jeremy's monthly driving.
2. Determine the total number of rotations per tire over a year.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations per tire for Jeremy's monthly driving.**

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. So, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
\[ \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/rotation cycle}} \times 725 \text{ rotations} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of rotations per tire over a year.**

Since there are 12 months in a year, the number of rotations per tire in a year is:
\[ 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.**

To find out how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations, we divide the total number of rotations by the number of rotations per year:
\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

So, the tire will need to be replaced in \(\boxed{6}\) years."
"First, we need to determine the total number of washings per pump. According to the directions, 2 pumps of shampoo give 120 washings. Therefore, 1 pump would give half of that:

120 washings / 2 pumps = 60 washings per pump

Next, we need to find out the cost per washing. The jumbo bottle costs $24.00 and gives 120 washings:

$24.00 / 120 washings = $0.20 per washing

Since Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the cost per pump is the same as the cost per washing:

$0.20 per washing = $0.20 per pump

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100 (since 1 dollar = 100 cents):

$0.20 * 100 = 20 cents

Therefore, each pump costs 20 cents."
"First, let's calculate the discount on the shirt and the shorts.

The shirt originally costs $25, and there is a 30% discount on it. To find the discount amount, we calculate 30% of $25:
\[ 0.30 \times 25 = 7.50 \]

So, the discounted price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

Next, the shorts originally cost $35. There is no discount mentioned for the shorts, so the price remains $35.

Now, we add the discounted price of the shirt and the price of the shorts to find the total cost:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. Since the total cost of the items is $52.50, which is more than what Joe has, he cannot afford to buy both items. However, if we assume the question is asking hypothetically or there's a mistake in the problem setup, we can still calculate how much he would be short:
\[ 52.50 - 50 = 2.50 \]

But since the question asks how much money Joe will have left, and he cannot make the purchase, the answer is that he will have:
\[ 0 \]

Final answer:
\[ 0 \]"
"To find out how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a day.
2. Calculate the total number of dozens he wants to make in a week.
3. Calculate the total amount of butter needed based on the number of dozens.

Step 1: Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day.

Step 2: Since he wants to make these croissants for a week, we need to multiply the daily amount by 7 (the number of days in a week).
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 28 \text{ dozen/week} \]

Step 3: It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. So, for 28 dozen croissants, we need:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 28 dozen croissants in a week."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we need to calculate the cost of repaving each street and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:
- The cost per meter is $194.
- Monica's street is 150 meters long.
- Therefore, the cost to repave Monica's street is \( 194 \times 150 \).

\[ 194 \times 150 = 29100 \]

So, it costs $29,100 to repave Monica's street.

Next, let's calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:
- The cost per meter is $194.
- Lewis' street is 490 meters long.
- Therefore, the cost to repave Lewis' street is \( 194 \times 490 \).

\[ 194 \times 490 = 95060 \]

So, it costs $95,060 to repave Lewis' street.

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between repaving Lewis' street and Monica's street:
- The cost to repave Lewis' street is $95,060.
- The cost to repave Monica's street is $29,100.
- The difference in cost is \( 95060 - 29100 \).

\[ 95060 - 29100 = 65960 \]

So, it costs $65,960 more to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street."
"John initially gets funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months. The research takes 10 times that long, so it takes 50 months in total. The first 5 months cost $100,000, and every month after that costs 50% more than the previous month.

The final cost of the research is approximately $1,105,733,228,453.09."
"The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that's 8 ounces.
The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, that's 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these together: 6 + 8 + 16 = 30 ounces.

The total amount of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days in March.
2. Calculate the total number of posts per day for the group.
3. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in March.

March has 31 days.

Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day. With 1000 members, the total number of posts per day is:
\[ 1000 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ posts/member/day} = 3000 \text{ posts/day} \]

Now, to find the total number of posts in March:
\[ 3000 \text{ posts/day} \times 31 \text{ days} = 93000 \text{ posts} \]

So, the total number of posts in March is 93,000."
"Gary does laundry twice a week. There are 52 weeks in a year, so he does laundry 52 * 2 = 104 times a year.

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so for 104 loads, he uses 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons of water.

A gallon of water costs $0.15, so for 2080 gallons, he spends 2080 * $0.15 = $312.

Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year."
"Let's break down the costs:

1. Aquarium: $10.00
2. Rocks: 2 bags at $2.50 each = 2 * $2.50 = $5.00
3. Coral: 3 pieces at $2.00 each = 3 * $2.00 = $6.00
4. Fish: 20 fish at $0.50 each = 20 * $0.50 = $10.00
5. Fish food: $2.00

Now, let's add all these costs together:

$10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00

So, Scarlett spent a total of $33.00."
"After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

In the second week, it doubled in height, so it became 3 inches * 2 = 6 inches tall.

In the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so it became 6 inches + 4 inches = 10 inches tall.

The beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks."
"Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day. So, the amount of meat he sells in a day is:

15kg/hour * 10 hours/day = 150kg/day

The bull weighs 750kg. To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell all the meat from the bull, we divide the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat he sells in a day:

750kg / 150kg/day = 5 days

It will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"First, let's calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, so the total number of seats is:

4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Next, we need to find out how many seats were occupied by the administrators. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, so:

72 seats * 1/4 = 18 seats

Now, we subtract the seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats to find out how many seats were left:

72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents, so:

54 seats * 1/3 = 18 seats

Now, we subtract the seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats to find out how many seats were left for the students:

54 seats - 18 seats = 36 seats

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is:

36 students

"Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. So, the number of street lights at one intersection is:

\[ 4 \text{ lights/pole} \times 6 \text{ poles} = 24 \text{ lights} \]

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is:

\[ 24 \text{ lights/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ lights} \]

If 20 street lights are not working, then the number of functioning street lights is:

\[ 96 \text{ lights} - 20 \text{ lights} = 76 \text{ lights} \]

Final numerical answer:

"Each DVD can be played 1000 times before it breaks.

The first DVD has been played 356 times, so it can be played \(1000 - 356 = 644\) more times.

The second DVD has been played 135 times, so it can be played \(1000 - 135 = 865\) more times.

To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we add the remaining play counts together:

\(644 + 865 = 1509\)

Both DVDs can be played a total of 1509 times before they break."
"John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks, and each week he went twice for 2 hours at a time. So, each week he had 2 sessions of 2 hours each, which totals 4 hours per week.

The cost per hour for the sessions is $125. Therefore, the cost for 4 hours per week is 4 hours * $125/hour = $500 per week.

Since he went for 6 weeks, the total cost is 6 weeks * $500/week = $3000.

The total cost for the physical therapy is $3000."
"Jim chews 1 piece of gum every 2 hours at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces} \]

He also chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so that's:

\[ 1 + 1 = 2 \text{ pieces} \]

Adding the pieces chewed at school, on the way home, and after dinner:

\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces} \]

Jim started with 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has:

\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Before bed, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is:

\[ 14 - 7 = 7 \text{ pieces} \]

**Final Answer: 7 pieces**"
"Charmaine will be 16 years old in 12 years. So, we need to find out her current age first. If she will be 16 in 12 years, she is currently 16 - 12 = 4 years old.

Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now."
"First, let's calculate how much the baseball coach spent. The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs at $3 each. So, the total cost for the baseballs is:

9 baseballs * $3/baseball = $27

Next, let's calculate how much the basketball coach spent. The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs at $14 each. So, the total cost for the basketballs is:

8 basketballs * $14/basketball = $112

Now, to find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we subtract the amount spent by the baseball coach from the amount spent by the basketball coach:

$112 - $27 = $85

The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"Arianna's garden has 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row. So, the total number of flowers planted is:

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb/s to Mb/s.
2. Convert the speed from Mb/s to Mb/h.

Step 1: Convert kb/s to Mb/s
Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can convert 20 kb/s to Mb/s by dividing by 1000.
\[ 20 \, \text{kb/s} = \frac{20}{1000} \, \text{Mb/s} = 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \]

Step 2: Convert Mb/s to Mb/h
There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply the speed in Mb/s by 3600 to get the speed in Mb/h.
\[ 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \times 3600 \, \text{s/h} = 72 \, \text{Mb/h} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"On the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. So, for three days, it pulled:
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

On the remaining four days, it pulled four fewer cars than the first three days, which means it pulled:
10 cars/day - 4 cars/day = 6 cars/day

For the remaining four days, it pulled:
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Adding the cars pulled on the first three days and the last four days gives:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

So, the total number of cars it towed that week is:
54 cars"
"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.

First, let's convert Adam's current height from inches to feet. Adam is 40 inches tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert his height as follows:
\[ \text{Adam's height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how much taller Adam needs to be to meet the 4 feet requirement:
\[ \text{Height difference} = 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:
\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, we can calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet:
\[ \text{Years needed} = \frac{\frac{2}{3} \text{ feet}}{\frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year}} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"First, let's calculate the total cost the company paid to acquire the cars. Since the company paid 30% of the price of each car, and each car cost $25,000, the cost per car is:

\[ 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]

Since James sold 10 cars, the total cost for the company is:

\[ 7,500 \times 10 = 75,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the cars. Since each car was sold for $25,000 and he sold 10 cars, the total revenue is:

\[ 25,000 \times 10 = 250,000 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profit. So, his commission is:

\[ 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 17,500 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate:

25% of 100 riders = 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders

Next, we need to find out how many of these riders are men. We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, so the remaining 40% must be men. Therefore, we calculate:

40% of 25 riders = 0.40 * 25 = 10 men

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10."
"First, let's find the price of the gold jewel. Since the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel, and the diamond jewel costs $2000, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

\[ \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \]

Next, we need to find the price of the silver jewel. The problem states that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. So, we subtract $400 from the price of the gold jewel:

\[ \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200 \]

Now, we need to find the total price for all three jewels. We add the prices of the diamond jewel, the gold jewel, and the silver jewel:

\[ \text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800 \]

So, the total price for all three jewels is:

\[ \boxed{4800} \]"
"Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of each type of stamp together:

16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45 stamps.

Max bought 45 stamps in all."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob. 

First, we calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Since Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour and Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour, the difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour.

Next, we need to find out how long it will take Tom to cover the 75-mile gap at this rate. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

5 hours"
"Naomi caught 17 fish.

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish."
"First, we need to find out the cost per class. Manny signed up for Karate classes for $60, and there are 10 total classes. So, the cost per class is $60 / 10 = $6.

Now, we need to determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10. If the cost per class is to stay at or below $10, we need to find out how many classes he can attend to keep the cost per class at $10.

Let's say Manny attends \( x \) classes. The cost per class would then be \( \frac{60}{x} \). We need this to be less than or equal to $10, so we set up the inequality:

\[ \frac{60}{x} \leq 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides by \( x \) and then divide both sides by 10:

\[ 60 \leq 10x \]
\[ 6 \leq x \]

This means Manny can attend at least 6 classes to keep the cost per class at or below $10. Since there are 10 total classes, the number of classes he can miss is:

\[ 10 - 6 = 4 \]

So, Manny can miss 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"First, let's determine how many customers Julie processes daily. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, and Jewel processes 50 customers daily, Julie processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers daily.

Next, we calculate the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in one day. This is \(50 + 100 = 150\) customers.

Since they work all days of the week, we need to find out how many customers they process in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly production is \(150 \times 7 = 1050\) customers.

Final numerical answer:

"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

First, let's find the cost of one apple:
- Four apples cost $5.20.
- So, the cost of one apple is $5.20 ÷ 4 = $1.30.

Next, let's find the cost of one orange:
- Three oranges cost $3.30.
- So, the cost of one orange is $3.30 ÷ 3 = $1.10.

Now, we can calculate the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
- The cost for 5 apples is 5 × $1.30 = $6.50.
- The cost for 5 oranges is 5 × $1.10 = $5.50.

Adding these together gives us the total cost:
- $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

So, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume of a rectangular hole is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and depth.

Volume = Length × Width × Depth
Volume = 6 feet × 4 feet × 3 feet
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Now, if it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can calculate the total time it will take him to dig the hole by multiplying the volume of the hole by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot.

Total time = Volume × Time per cubic foot
Total time = 72 cubic feet × 3 seconds/cubic foot
Total time = 216 seconds

So, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole."
"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so \( \frac{7500}{3} = 2500 \) dollars
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so \( 2500 - 500 = 2000 \) dollars
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1500

Now, let's add all these costs together:

So, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $41,500."
"First, let's calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise.

1. Calculate the raise amount:
\[ \text{Raise amount} = 20000 \times \frac{5}{100} = 1000 \]

2. Calculate the new monthly salary:
\[ \text{New monthly salary} = 20000 + 1000 = 21000 \]

Next, let's calculate the bonus he receives, which is half a month's salary.

3. Calculate the bonus:
\[ \text{Bonus} = 21000 \times \frac{1}{2} = 10500 \]

Now, let's calculate Tim's total monthly income including the bonus.

Finally, let's calculate Tim's annual income.

5. Calculate the annual income:
\[ \text{Annual income} = 31500 \times 12 = 378000 \]

So, Tim will make \(\boxed{378000}\) dollars in a year."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the suits. James buys 10 suits at $750 each:
\[ 10 \times 750 = 7500 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the dress pants. Each dress pant costs 1/5 the cost of a suit, so:
\[ \frac{750}{5} = 150 \]
Since he buys 10 dress pants:
\[ 10 \times 150 = 1500 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts. He buys 3 dress shirts per suit, and he has 10 suits, so he buys:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]
Each dress shirt costs $60, so:
\[ 30 \times 60 = 1800 \]

Finally, we add up all the costs:
\[ 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800 \]

So, the total cost of everything is:

"To find out how many miles Alisa and Stanley biked in total, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add those distances together.

First, let's calculate the distance Alisa biked:
- Alisa's speed: 12 miles per hour
- Alisa's time: 4.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Alisa biked = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Stanley biked:
- Stanley's speed: 10 miles per hour
- Stanley's time: 2.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Stanley biked = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances together to find the total distance biked by both:
Total distance = Distance Alisa biked + Distance Stanley biked
Total distance = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

Therefore, the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"First, we need to calculate the time it takes for Bill to dig through the soil. He can dig 4 feet per hour through soil. Since he has to dig through 24 feet of soil, we can calculate the time as follows:

\[ \text{Time through soil} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for Bill to dig through the clay. He digs through clay at half the speed he digs through soil, which means he digs at 2 feet per hour. Since he has to dig through 8 feet of clay, we can calculate the time as follows:

\[ \text{Time through clay} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay to get the total time:

\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time it will take Bill to dig the well is 10 hours."
"Howie is buying cupcakes for himself, his teacher, and 25 classmates. That makes a total of 26 people (25 classmates + 1 teacher + 1 Howie).

Since Howie wants to get one vanilla and one chocolate cupcake for each person, that means each person will get 2 cupcakes.

So, for 26 people, the total number of cupcakes Howie should buy is:

26 people * 2 cupcakes/person = 52 cupcakes

Howie should buy 52 cupcakes."
"Fishio initially received 2000 likes on her selfie.

Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes. So, the number of likes at that time would be:
\[ 2000 \times 70 = 140000 \]

Recently, she received 20000 more new likes. So, the total number of likes now would be:
\[ 140000 + 20000 = 160000 \]

Therefore, the total number of Instagram likes is:
\[ 160000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost Clara paid for the pomegranates on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the voucher was:
\[ 20 \text{ pomegranates} \times \$20 \text{ per pomegranate} = \$400 \]

She got a $2 discount, so the final amount she paid was:
\[ \$400 - \$2 = \$398 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost Sheila paid for the pomegranates on Wednesday.

The price per pomegranate on Wednesday was $30, so the total cost before the discount was:
\[ 20 \text{ pomegranates} \times \$30 \text{ per pomegranate} = \$600 \]

Sheila got a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount was:
\[ 10\% \times \$600 = 0.10 \times \$600 = \$60 \]

Therefore, the final amount Sheila paid was:
\[ \$600 - \$60 = \$540 \]

Now, we find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
\[ \$540 - \$398 = \$142 \]

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
\[ \$142 \]"
"First, let's find out how much Ariadne made from selling green hats in the first month. We know that the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. So, the sales from green hats would be:

\[ 400 \times 2 = 800 \]

So, in the first month, Ariadne made a total of:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

In the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month would be:

\[ 1200 \times \frac{3}{4} = 900 \]

Now, to find the total amount she made in two months, we add the sales from the first month and the second month:

\[ 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

So, the total amount she made in two months is:

\[ 2100 \]"
"James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The first paid hour costs $15. Each hour after that costs twice the first hour, so the second and third hours each cost $15 * 2 = $30.

So, the total cost is:
- First hour: $15
- Second hour: $30
- Third hour: $30

Total cost = $15 + $30 + $30 = $75

James paid $75."
"Sally's bank account increased from $200 to $420 this week. The difference in her bank account balance is $420 - $200 = $220. Since her weekly wage should be $300 and she only has $220 in her account, the amount withheld from her wage is $300 - $220 = $80. 

The final numerical answer is:

"Lori needs 1 whole egg for 2 deviled egg halves. If each guest eats 3 deviled egg halves, then each guest will need:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ halves}}{2 \text{ halves/egg}} = 1.5 \text{ eggs per guest} \]

With 16 guests, the total number of eggs needed is:

\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 1.5 \text{ eggs/guest} = 24 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the number of dozens of eggs needed is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozen} \]

"First, let's calculate the cost of the plane. The plane cost $150,000.

Next, we need to calculate the monthly costs for the hanger and fuel. The hanger rental is $5000 a month. The fuel cost is twice the hanger rental, so it's $5000 * 2 = $10,000 a month.

Now, let's add the monthly costs for the hanger and fuel: $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 a month.

To find the total cost for the first year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12: $15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

Finally, we add the cost of the plane to the yearly maintenance cost: $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000.

So, the total cost for the first year is $330,000."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. It took 30 minutes to cook rice.
2. It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice.
3. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.

From point 1, we know the time to cook rice is 30 minutes.

From point 2, the time to cook pork is 20 minutes more than the time to cook rice:
\[ \text{Time to cook pork} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

From point 3, the time to cook beans is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice:
\[ \text{Combined cooking time of pork and rice} = 50 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ \text{Time to cook beans} = \frac{80 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add up the cooking times for all the food:
\[ \text{Total cooking time} = \text{Time to cook rice} + \text{Time to cook pork} + \text{Time to cook beans} \]
\[ \text{Total cooking time} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 50 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it took to cook all the food is 120 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars.

So, the first mixture costs $3 more than the second mixture."
"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given about the number of legs and heads of the animals on Lee's farm.

1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we have two equations:
1. The total number of heads is 20: \( S + G = 20 \).
2. The total number of legs is 70: \( 4S + 2G = 70 \).

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To find \( S \) and \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

Therefore, the apple pie cost $7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

Total newspapers delivered in a day = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers - (Newspapers to District A + Newspapers to District C)

Let's do the math:

Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - (198 + 209)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 407
Newspapers delivered to District B = 193

James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John spends in the cooking class.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time. So, the total hours per week are:
\[ 4 \text{ times/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/time} = 8 \text{ hours/week} \]

The class lasts for 6 weeks, so the total hours spent in the class are:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find out how many recipes he learns, we divide the total hours by 1.5:

"First, we need to find out how many of the 150 teachers are math teachers. We know that 60% of the teachers are history teachers, so the remaining 40% are math teachers.

To find the number of math teachers, we calculate 40% of 150:
\[ 0.40 \times 150 = 60 \]

So, there are 60 math teachers on the court.

Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:
\[ 60 \text{ teachers} \times 6 \text{ hours/teacher} = 360 \text{ hours} \]

The total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours."
"First, let's find out how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, we know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's money as follows:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, we add the money of Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia together:

\[ \text{Total money} = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360 \]

If they decide to share the money equally, each person would get:

\[ \text{Each person's share} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \]

So, each person would have \(\boxed{120}\) dollars."

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 14."
"Let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Janey has 21 books.
2. The problem states that Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. So, if we let the number of books Sally has be \( S \), then Janey has \( 2S + 3 \) books.
3. We know Janey has 21 books, so we can set up the equation: \( 2S + 3 = 21 \).
4. To find \( S \), we need to solve the equation. First, subtract 3 from both sides: \( 2S = 18 \).
5. Then, divide both sides by 2: \( S = 9 \).

So, Sally has 9 books.

Sally has 9 books."
"First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can calculate the current height in inches as follows:

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

The target height is 600 inches. To find out how much more the bamboo needs to grow to reach this height, we subtract the current height from the target height:

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

The bamboo grows 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take to grow the additional 360 inches, we divide the total inches needed by the daily growth rate:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches.

12 days"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are now 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is 4 + 8 = 12 dogs. Therefore, James needs to buy 8 more toys, making the total 4 + 8 = 12 toys.
3. After buying the toys, the number of dogs doubles. So, the new number of dogs is 12 * 2 = 24 dogs. This means James needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys, making the total 12 + 12 = 24 toys.
4. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone. So, the number of dogs is now 24 - 3 = 21 dogs. This means James needs 21 toys in total.

"First, we need to calculate the total weight of the 9 people (Jack and 8 other adults) in the elevator.

Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg. So, the total weight of the 8 other adults is:
\[ 80 \, \text{kg/adult} \times 8 \, \text{adults} = 640 \, \text{kg} \]

Adding Jack's weight to this, the total weight is:
\[ 640 \, \text{kg} + 80 \, \text{kg} = 720 \, \text{kg} \]

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much the total weight exceeds the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 \, \text{kg} - 700 \, \text{kg} = 20 \, \text{kg} \]

So, they will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"Katarina has 68 cookies.

Max has 5 more cookies than Katarina, so Max has \(68 + 5 = 73\) cookies.

The Cookie Monster has 12 fewer cookies than Max, so the Cookie Monster has \(73 - 12 = 61\) cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has \(73 + 23 = 96\) cookies.

To find the total number of cookies, we add up the cookies each person has:

Katarina: 68
Max: 73
Cookie Monster: 61
Summer: 96

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the extension is \( 0.5x \) cm. She also adds 20 cm with a lace trim. Therefore, the total length of the dress after these modifications is:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 \]

We know that the final length of the dress is 140 cm. So, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]

\[ x = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

The final answer is:

"In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour, which is 60 minutes. So, in ""turtle"" mode, he mows \(\frac{1}{60}\) of the lawn per minute.

In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. So, in ""rabbit"" mode, he mows \(\frac{1}{40}\) of the lawn per minute.

Today, Chris mowed half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's calculate the time it took to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode:
\[
\text{Time in ""turtle"" mode} = \frac{1}{2} \div \frac{1}{60} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time it took to mow the other half of the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode:
\[
\text{Time in ""rabbit"" mode} = \frac{1}{2} \div \frac{1}{40} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Adding these times together gives the total time Chris spent mowing the lawn:
\[
30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}

"Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as \( x \). Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of that twin would be \( x + 7 \).

The other triplet and the other twin would be the same age as the younger triplet and the younger twin, respectively, because they are part of a set of twins and a set of triplets. So, the age of the other triplet is also \( x \), and the age of the other twin is also \( x + 7 \).

The combined ages of all four individuals are given as 44. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 7) + x + (x + 7) = 44 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 4x + 14 = 44 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):

\[ 4x = 44 - 14 \]
\[ 4x = 30 \]
\[ x = \frac{30}{4} \]
\[ x = 7.5 \]

So, the age of the younger triplet is 7.5 years. The age of one of the twins, who is 7 years older than the younger triplet, is:

\[ x + 7 = 7.5 + 7 = 14.5 \]

Therefore, the age of one of the twins is 14.5 years."

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 lollipops. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, 10 lollipops will cost $0.40 * 10 = $4.00.

Now, we calculate the cost of 10 candies. Since each candy costs $0.80, 10 candies will cost $0.80 * 10 = $8.00.

Finally, we add the cost of the lollipops and the candies to find the total cost. So, $4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00.

The final numerical answer is:
$12.00"
"First, let's calculate how many coins Rong saves each month. Rong saves 20 coins per month.

Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong each month. To find out how many more coins Neil saves, we calculate 2/5 of 20:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

So, Neil saves 8 more coins than Rong each month. Therefore, Neil saves:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each has saved after 10 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, over 10 years, there are:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong saves 20 coins per month, so in 120 months, he saves:
\[ 20 \times 120 = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil saves 28 coins per month, so in 120 months, he saves:
\[ 28 \times 120 = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding the coins saved by Rong and Neil together, we get:
\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \]

So, the total number of coins they have after 10 years is:
\[ 5760 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Each vaccine costs $20, and the dog needs 2 vaccines. So, the total cost for the vaccines is:

\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Next, let's denote the cost of the heartworm check as \( x \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check. Therefore, we can write the total bill as:

\[ 40 + x \]

Since the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, we can write:

\[ x = 0.6 \times (40 + x) \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, distribute the 0.6:

\[ x = 24 + 0.6x \]

Next, isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.6x \) from both sides:

\[ x - 0.6x = 24 \]

\[ 0.4x = 24 \]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.4:

\[ x = \frac{24}{0.4} = 60 \]

So, the cost of the heartworm check is $60. Now, we can find the total bill by adding the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:

\[ 40 + 60 = 100 \]

John brought $125 with him. After paying the total bill of $100, the amount he leaves with is:

\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of each type of fruit per piece:
- One apple costs $0.5.
- One banana costs twice as much as an apple, so a banana costs $0.5 * 2 = $1.
- One orange costs three times as much as a banana, so an orange costs $1 * 3 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:
- There are 12 apples, so the total cost for apples is 12 * $0.5 = $6.
- There are 5 bananas, so the total cost for bananas is 5 * $1 = $5.
- There are 7 oranges, so the total cost for oranges is 7 * $3 = $21.

Finally, let's add up the costs to find the total price for the crate:
- Total cost = $6 (apples) + $5 (bananas) + $21 (oranges) = $32.

The price for such a crate of fruit is $32."
"First, let's find out how many squares of each color Brittany's comforter has.

1. Red squares: 14
2. Blue squares: 4 more than red squares, so \(14 + 4 = 18\)
3. Green squares: 6 more than blue squares, so \(18 + 6 = 24\)
4. White squares: 12 fewer than green squares, so \(24 - 12 = 12\)

Now, let's add up all the squares to find the total number of squares in the comforter:
\[14 \text{ (red)} + 18 \text{ (blue)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 12 \text{ (white)} = 68\]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is the same as the total number of squares. Therefore, the total area of Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet.

68"
"First, let's determine the number of regular chairs Mia's restaurant currently has. Since the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

\[ \text{Number of regular chairs} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of chairs currently available in the restaurant:

\[ \text{Total current chairs} = \text{Number of regular chairs} + \text{Number of high chairs} = 40 + 8 = 48 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs needed for the function. There will be 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of chairs required is:

\[ \text{Total chairs needed} = 42 + 15 = 57 \]

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the number of chairs currently available from the total number of chairs needed:

\[ \text{Additional chairs needed} = 57 - 48 = 9 \]

Therefore, Mia has to get \(\boxed{9}\) more chairs."
"First, we need to find out how many bucks there are in the field. Since 50 percent of the 50 deer are bucks, we calculate:

50 deer * 50% = 25 bucks

Next, we need to find out how many of these bucks are 8 points. Since 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points, we calculate:

25 bucks * 20% = 5

So, there are 5 eight-point bucks in the field."
"First, let's calculate the points collected by each student:

1. Adam has 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. So, Betty's points are:
   \[
   50 + (0.30 \times 50) = 50 + 15 = 65 \text{ points}
   \]
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom's points are:
   \[
   65 - 30 = 35 \text{ points}
   \]
4. Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. So, Martha's points are:
   \[
   3 \times 35 = 105 \text{ points}
   \]

Now, let's sum up the points collected by all the students:
\[
50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 \text{ points}
\]

The class needs a minimum of 400 points to go on the trip. Therefore, the points the class is missing are:
\[
400 - 255 = 145 \text{ points}
\]

Final answer:
\[

"First, let's calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400.00 paycheck into her retirement account.

\[ 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

So, she puts $1200.00 into her retirement account.

Next, we calculate how much she uses for her monthly car payment. She uses 20% of her $2400.00 paycheck for her car payment.

\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

So, she uses $480.00 for her car payment.

Now, we subtract the amounts she put into her retirement account and used for her car payment from her total paycheck to find out how much money she has left to spend.

\[ 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

So, Greta has $720.00 left to spend."
"There are 20 - 4 = 16 pencils in the box.

"First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks set off by the city. The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each. So, the total number of fireworks from the city is:

\[ 15 \times 20 = 300 \]

Hannah's house is at the right angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks. So, the number of fireworks Hannah will see from the city is:

\[ 300 \times 0.40 = 120 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard. Hannah is setting off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each. So, the total number of fireworks from Hannah's backyard is:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Now, we add the fireworks Hannah will see from the city and the fireworks she will set off in her backyard to find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see:

\[ 120 + 15 = 135 \]

So, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is:

\[ \boxed{135} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:

13 + 7 = 20

Each person saves a seat and buys drinks and snacks for the seat. Each seat requires 2 drinks and 3 snacks. Since drinks and snacks cost $2 each, we can calculate the cost for drinks and snacks per seat:

Cost of drinks per seat = 2 drinks * $2/drink = $4
Cost of snacks per seat = 3 snacks * $2/snack = $6

Total cost per seat = Cost of drinks + Cost of snacks = $4 + $6 = $10

Since there are 20 seats, the total cost for all seats is:

Total cost = 20 seats * $10/seat = $200

So, the group has spent $200 overall on snacks and drinks."
"Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so:
4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

When Gary's truck joins, the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds. So, to find out how much Gary's truck can haul, we subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity:
11,600 - (4,000 + 4,800) = 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel."
"Each female ate 3 dumplings. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is 8 * 4 = 32 dumplings.

There are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is 6 * 3 = 18 dumplings.

The total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings eaten by the males and the females, which is 32 + 18 = 50 dumplings.

If Gerald spent $10 on a book, he has $60 - $10 = $50 left.

Therefore, Gerald has $50 left."
"First, we need to determine the speed of the turtle. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and the cat can run 15 feet/second, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we need to calculate how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We do this by multiplying the turtle's speed by the time.

\[ \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find out how many more hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we first need to determine how much more money they need to reach their goal. The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount they need to raise is:

$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Next, we need to find out how much money they raise per hour. From the first 3 hours, they raised $2100. So, the amount raised per hour is:

$2100 ÷ 3 hours = $700 per hour

Now, to find out how many more hours they need to raise the remaining $4200, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour:

$4200 ÷ $700 per hour = 6 hours

So, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours to reach their goal.

Total hours needed to reach the goal = 3 hours (already fundraised) + 6 hours (needed) = 9 hours

Therefore, they have to fundraise for a total of 9 hours to reach their goal."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.
2. 80% of that 40% is used for industrial purposes.

To find out how much of the river's water is used for industrial purposes, we calculate 80% of 40%:
\[ 0.80 \times 40\% = 0.80 \times 0.40 = 0.32 \]
So, 32% of the river's total water is used for industrial purposes.

Now, to find out how much of the river's water is used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial usage from the total usage by the city:
\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

Therefore, 8% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the production rate for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream and then calculate the total production in 48 hours.

First, let's find the production rate for chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Next, let's find the production rate for vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Now, we calculate the total production in 48 hours for both types of ice cream:
- For chocolate ice cream: \( 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).
- For vanilla ice cream: \( 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Finally, we add the production of both types of ice cream to get the total production in 48 hours:
- Total production = \( 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \).

Therefore, the total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 3000."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Marcus ordered:

- Croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each = 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each = 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each = 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost before the discount:
$15.00 (croissants) + $10.00 (cinnamon rolls) + $12.00 (mini quiches) + $13.00 (blueberry muffins) = $50.00

Next, we apply the 10% discount:
10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Subtract the discount from the total:
$50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

So, Marcus' total bill is $45.00."
"Erin has $6.00 and each scoop costs $1.50. With the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. 

First, let's calculate how many scoops she can buy with her $6.00 if she just buys them without the deal:
\[ \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

With the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 free. So, for every 3 scoops, she only pays for 2. 

If she buys 4 scoops, she would get 1 free (since 4 scoops is more than 3 but less than 6, which would give her 2 free scoops). 

So, the total number of scoops she would get is:
\[ 4 \text{ (bought)} + 1 \text{ (free)} = 5 \text{ scoops} \]

"First, we need to find out how much area Mr. Boarden wants to cover. He wants to cover two thirds of his 36 square feet bathroom.

To find two thirds of 36 square feet, we calculate:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we know that for every square foot, Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles. So, to find out how many tiles he needs for 24 square feet, we multiply:
\[ 24 \text{ square feet} \times 24 \text{ tiles per square foot} = 576 \text{ tiles} \]

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 square feet bathroom.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries. James paid a flat fee of $20 to go picking and then $1.5 per pound for the blueberries he picked. Since he picked 30 pounds, the cost for the blueberries is:

\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

Adding the flat fee, the total cost for picking the blueberries is:

\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost if James had bought the same amount of blueberries at the store. The store price is $2.5 per pound, so for 30 pounds, the cost would be:

\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

To find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking the blueberries from the cost of buying them at the store:

\[ \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \]

So, James saved \(\boxed{10}\) dollars."
"First, we need to find the new price of each computer. The original price was $700, and it increased by 10%. To find the new price, we calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

10% of $700 = 0.10 * 700 = $70

So, the new price of each computer is $700 + $70 = $770.

Now, we need to find out how much the company paid for 500 computers at the new price.

Total cost = 500 * $770 = $385,000

The total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is $385,000."
"First, let's calculate the calories from the eggs. John uses 6 eggs, and each egg is 75 calories. So, the total calories from the eggs are:
\[ 6 \text{ eggs} \times 75 \text{ calories/egg} = 450 \text{ calories} \]

Next, let's calculate the calories from the cheese. John uses 2 oz of cheese, and each ounce of cheese is 120 calories. So, the total calories from the cheese are:
\[ 2 \text{ oz} \times 120 \text{ calories/oz} = 240 \text{ calories} \]

Now, let's calculate the calories from the ham. John uses an equal amount of ham as cheese, which is 2 oz, and each ounce of ham is 40 calories. So, the total calories from the ham are:
\[ 2 \text{ oz} \times 40 \text{ calories/oz} = 80 \text{ calories} \]

Finally, we add up all the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham to get the total calories in the omelet:

"To find the total number of taps Helga makes, we need to calculate the taps for each foot separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the taps when her arms are not raised. She dances for \(5 - 2 = 3\) minutes with her arms not raised.

- Right foot: 300 taps per minute
- Left foot: 250 taps per minute

For 3 minutes without arms raised:
- Right foot: \(300 \times 3 = 900\) taps
- Left foot: \(250 \times 3 = 750\) taps

Next, let's calculate the taps when her arms are raised. She dances for 2 minutes with her arms raised.

- Right foot: 200 taps per minute
- Left foot: 200 taps per minute

For 2 minutes with arms raised:
- Right foot: \(200 \times 2 = 400\) taps

"To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of having the city fix it and the total cost of Ron fixing it himself, then find the difference.

1. **Cost of having the city fix the pothole:**
   - The pothole will do $450 worth of damage to Ron's car if it's not fixed.
   - The city council will fine Ron $120 for fixing it himself.
   - Total cost if the city fixes it: $450 (damage to car) - $120 (fine) = $330.

2. **Cost of Ron fixing the pothole himself:**
   - Ron needs to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, each costing $25.
   - Total cost of asphalt: 3 buckets * $25/bucket = $75.
   - Ron does not incur a fine for fixing it himself.
   - Total cost if Ron fixes it: $75 (asphalt).

3. **Savings by fixing the pothole himself:**
   - Cost if the city fixes it: $330.
   - Cost if Ron fixes it: $75.
   - Savings: $330 - $75 = $255.

Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself."

"First, let's calculate how many slices each person ate and how many were left from each pizza.

Each pizza has 12 slices.

Bryce and two of his friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas:
- 2/3 of 12 slices = 8 slices per pizza.
- So, each of these 3 people ate 8 slices.

The two remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas:
- 3/4 of 12 slices = 9 slices per pizza.
- So, each of these 2 people ate 9 slices.

Now, let's calculate the total slices eaten and the total slices left.

Total slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends:
- 3 people * 8 slices = 24 slices.

Total slices eaten by the two remaining friends:
- 2 people * 9 slices = 18 slices.

Total slices eaten:
- 24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices.

Total slices from 5 pizzas:
- 5 pizzas * 12 slices = 60 slices.

Total slices left:
- 60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices.

Final numerical answer:

"First, we need to convert the length of one of Topher’s shoes into inches. Topher’s shoe length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 8 feet to inches as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Adding the 4 inches, we get:

\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of one of Topher’s shoes is 100 inches.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher’s shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby’s shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby’s shoes as \( x \) inches. The relationship can be expressed as:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby’s shoes is 10 inches.

Final answer:
\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars. There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows. Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The number of students' cars' windows smashed is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 64 \times 4 = 64 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows. Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows.

The number of teachers' cars' windows smashed is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 32 \times 2 = 48 \]

Now, we add the number of windows smashed for both the students' and teachers' cars to get the total number of windows smashed:
\[ 64 + 48 = 112 \]

So, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:
\[ 112 \]"
"First, let's add up all the spools of thread Candy has:

- Light blue: 15 spools
- Dark blue: 45 spools
- Light green: 40 spools
- Dark green: 50 spools

Total spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 spools

Next, we need to find out how many of these spools are blue. The blue spools are the light blue and dark blue ones:

- Light blue: 15 spools
- Dark blue: 45 spools

Total blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60 spools

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\% \]

So, 40% of Candy's spools are blue."
"At 8:00, 5000 people lined up to vote.

By midday (12:00), 2/5 of the people had voted. So, the number of people who had voted by midday is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \]

The number of people remaining after 2000 had voted is:
\[ 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \]

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining 3000 people had voted. So, the number of people who had voted by 16:00 is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \]

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:
\[ 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \]

So, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. To find out how many pieces he needs for 30 days, we multiply the number of pieces he chews per day by the number of days:

4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces

Now, we need to find out how many packs of gum he will need. Since each pack contains 15 pieces of gum, we divide the total number of pieces he needs by the number of pieces per pack:

120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs

Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total number of smores needed.

For the kids:
9 kids * 2 smores per kid = 18 smores

For the adults:
6 adults * 1 smore per adult = 6 smores

Total smores needed:
18 smores (for kids) + 6 smores (for adults) = 24 smores

Now, let's find out how many smores can be made from one box of graham crackers.

Each sleeve makes 8 smores, and there are 3 sleeves in a box:
3 sleeves * 8 smores per sleeve = 24 smores per box

Since they need 24 smores and one box provides 24 smores, they will need:
24 smores / 24 smores per box = 1 box

Final numerical answer:
1 box"
"First, let's find out Dora's father's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, and her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age, we can calculate her father's age as follows:

Father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
Father's age = 2 * 15 + 8
Father's age = 30 + 8
Father's age = 38

Next, we calculate Dora's mother's age. Since Dora's mother is four years younger than her father:

Mother's age = Father's age - 4
Mother's age = 38 - 4
Mother's age = 34

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:

Total combined age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34
Total combined age = 87

The total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds."
"Candidate A got 20% of the votes. So, the number of votes for candidate A is:
20% of 100 = 20 votes

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes. So, the number of votes for candidate B is:
50% of 20 = 10 votes
Therefore, candidate B got:
20 votes + 10 votes = 30 votes

The total number of votes is 100. The votes for candidate C would be the remaining votes after subtracting the votes for candidates A and B:
100 votes - 20 votes (A) - 30 votes (B) = 50 votes

Candidate C got 50 votes."
"First, let's find out how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, Beck has:

\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Now, if Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Boris will have:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]

And Beck will have:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \]

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now."

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the packs Mark bought. He bought 3 packs at $1800 each, so the total cost is:

\[ 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \]

Next, let's calculate the total value of the cards he got. He got 1 card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000, so the value of these two cards is:

\[ 4000 + 1000 = 5000 \]

There are 30 more cards, each worth an average of $50, so the total value of these cards is:

\[ 30 \times 50 = 1500 \]

Adding the value of all the cards together, we get:

\[ 5000 + 1500 = 6500 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:

"The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day. He used to buy them for $0.5 each, but now he buys them for $0.4 each. 

First, let's calculate the daily savings:
- Cost per tomato with the old vendor: $0.5
- Cost per tomato with the new vendor: $0.4
- Savings per tomato: $0.5 - $0.4 = $0.1

Now, let's calculate the daily savings for 500 tomatoes:
- Daily savings: 500 tomatoes * $0.1 = $50

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the weekly savings:
- Weekly savings: $50 * 7 = $350

So, the vendor saves $350 a week."

"To find out how many chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays in one 4-week month:
- There are 5 weekdays in a week.
- In 4 weeks, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays.
- Each weekday, 60 chairs are rented.
- So, in one 4-week month, \(20 \times 60 = 1200\) chairs are rented during weekdays.

Next, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during weekends in one 4-week month:
- There are 2 weekend days in a week.
- In 4 weeks, there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.
- Each weekend day, 100 chairs are rented.
- So, in one 4-week month, \(8 \times 100 = 800\) chairs are rented during weekends.

Now, let's add the chairs rented during weekdays and weekends in one 4-week month:
- Total chairs rented in one 4-week month = \(1200 + 800 = 2000\).

Since we need to find out the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we multiply the total for one 4-week month by 2:
- Total chairs rented in two 4-week months = \(2000 \times 2 = 4000\).

So, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is 4000."

"First, let's break down the trades Lorraine makes.

1. **Small Stickers to Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers.
   - She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 is \( 0.9 \times 30 = 27 \) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so she gets 27 small buttons.

2. **Large Stickers to Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 40 large stickers.
   - She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 is \( 0.5 \times 40 = 20 \) large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so she gets \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) large buttons.

3. **Remaining Large Stickers to Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 40 large stickers initially and traded 20 of them.
   - She has \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) large stickers left.
   - She trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so she gets \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

4. **Total Buttons:**
   - From small stickers to large buttons, she gets 27 small buttons.
   - From large stickers to large buttons, she gets 60 large buttons.

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which means the sum of the votes in favor and against the regulation is 33. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house be \( x \).
2. The first house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles.
3. The third house will need double the amount of the first house, so it will need \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. So, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
\frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250
\]

Convert \( 2x \) to a fraction with a common denominator:

\[
\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = 250
\]

Add the fractions:

\[
\frac{5}{2}x = 250
\]

To solve for \( x \), multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{5} \):

\[
x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} = 100
\]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs the same amount as the second house, which is:

\[
x = 100
\]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles."

Each kilogram of oranges costs $3. Therefore, for 20 kilograms of oranges, Sam would have to spend 20 times $3.

20 * $3 = $60

Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice."
"Ezra read 300 books in one hour and decided to read 150 more. So, the total number of books Ezra read is:
300 + 150 = 450 books

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour, Ahmed read half the number of books Ezra read in that hour. So, Ahmed read:
300 / 2 = 150 books

Altogether, they have read:
450 (Ezra) + 150 (Ahmed) = 600 books

600"
"First, let's calculate Tanya's earnings for Monday. She taught 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, her earnings for the hours worked are:

\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$75 \]

Since she taught more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5:

\[ \$75 + \$5 = \$80 \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings for Wednesday. She taught 2 classes for 2 hours. Her earnings for the hours worked are:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$30 \]

Since she did not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5. So, her total earnings for Wednesday are:

\[ \$30 \]

Now, we add her earnings from both days to find her total earnings for the two days:

\[ \$80 + \$30 = \$110 \]

Therefore, Tanya earned \(\$110\) for these two days of teaching."
"First, let's calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold. Since they sold 5 of each of the 4 vanilla scents, the total number of vanilla scents sold is:

5 * 4 = 20

Next, let's calculate the total number of fruity scents sold. Since they sold 2 of each of the 8 fruity scents, the total number of fruity scents sold is:

2 * 8 = 16

Now, to find out how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold:

20 - 16 = 4

So, 4 more vanilla scents were sold compared with the fruity scents."
"First, we calculate how much money Bennet makes from selling the eggplants. He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so:

20 eggplants * $3/eggplant = $60

Bennet wants to make a total of $135. We subtract the money he already made from selling the eggplants to find out how much more he needs to make from selling the corn:

$135 - $60 = $75

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the total amount he needs to make from the corn by the number of ears of corn:

$75 / 25 ears = $3/ear

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

$3/ear"
"First, let's calculate the total time Tatiana has for her weekend activities. She has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, so the total time is:

\[ 7 + 5 = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know she reads for 3 hours. So, the remaining time after reading is:

\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Tatiana plays video games for \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the remaining 9 hours. So, the time spent on video games is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can find out how much time she spends playing soccer by subtracting the time spent on reading and video games from the total remaining time:

\[ 9 - 3 - 3 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

To find the percentage of her weekend that she spends playing soccer, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \left( \frac{\text{time spent on soccer}}{\text{total time}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{3}{12} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the percentage of her weekend that Tatiana spends playing soccer is:

\[ 25\% \]"
"Anthony had 50 pencils initially.

First, he gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]
So, Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon.

Now, he has:
\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \]
pencils left.

Next, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15 \]
So, Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie.

Now, he has:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]
pencils left.

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils."
"Jack drives 150 miles to the museum at 75 mph. The time to get there is 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours. The time to get back is also 2 hours. He spends 6 hours at the museum. So, the total time he is gone from home is 2 hours (to the museum) + 6 hours (at the museum) + 2 hours (back home) = 10 hours.

He is gone from home for 10 hours."
"To find out how many wheels Henry will need, we first calculate the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles separately.

For the cars:
57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels

For the motorcycles:
73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels

Now, we add the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles:
228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after he assembles all the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels used from the total number of wheels he has:
650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels

So, the final number of wheels left is:
276 wheels"
"To find out how much you have to pay after a 20% discount, first calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the original price.

1. Calculate the discount amount: \(20\% \times 1000 = 0.20 \times 1000 = 200\)
2. Subtract the discount from the original price: \(1000 - 200 = 800\)

So, you have to pay $800."
"First, let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. **Total number of movies**: 600

2. **Movies in series**: A third of the movies are in series.
   \[
   \text{Movies in series} = \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200
   \]

3. **Cost of series movies**: Each series movie costs $6.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for series movies} = 200 \times 6 = 1200
   \]

4. **Remaining movies**: Subtract the series movies from the total.
   \[
   \text{Remaining movies} = 600 - 200 = 400
   \]

5. **Older movies**: 40% of the remaining movies are older movies.
   \[
   \text{Older movies} = 0.4 \times 400 = 160
   \]

6. **Cost of older movies**: Each older movie costs $5.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for older movies} = 160 \times 5 = 800
   \]

7. **Normal movies**: The rest of the remaining movies are normal movies.
   \[
   \text{Normal movies} = 400 - 160 = 240
   \]

8. **Cost of normal movies**: Each normal movie costs $10.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for normal movies} = 240 \times 10 = 2400
   \]

9. **Total cost**: Add the costs of all the movies.
   \[

"To find out how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost for each type of fruit he picked and then add them together.

1. **Peaches**: 
   - Price per pound: $2.00
   - Pounds picked: 6
   - Total cost for peaches: \( 6 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$12.00 \)

2. **Plums**: 
   - Price per pound: $1.00
   - Pounds picked: 8
   - Total cost for plums: \( 8 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \)

3. **Apricots**: 
   - Price per pound: $3.00
   - Pounds picked: 6
   - Total cost for apricots: \( 6 \text{ pounds} \times \$3.00/\text{pound} = \$18.00 \)

Now, we add the total costs for each type of fruit to find the overall amount spent:

- Total cost: \( \$12.00 + \$8.00 + \$18.00 = \$38.00 \)

So, Winston spent $38.00 on fruit."
"First, let's calculate the distance they hiked. They hiked for 1.5 hours at an average speed of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.

Half of their driving speed is:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, their hiking speed is:
\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance they hiked:
\[ \text{Distance hiked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how long they drove. The total time spent traveling (driving and hiking) is 6 hours, and they spent 1.5 hours hiking, so the time spent driving is:
\[ 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance they drove:
\[ \text{Distance driven} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \times 4.5 = 225 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, the total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 225 + 30 = 255 \text{ miles} \]

So, the distance to their vacation spot is:
\[ 255 \text{ miles} \]"
"Let's break down the points for both Ava and Emma based on the given information.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( E_e \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( E_b \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( E_t \) be the time left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.

From the problem, we know:
- Ava jumps on \( E_e + 8 \) enemies.
- Ava collects \( E_b + 3 \) berries.
- Ava finishes the level \( E_t + 4 \) seconds later.

Now, let's calculate the points for each:
- Points for enemies: \( 10 \times (E_e + 8) \) for Ava and \( 10 \times E_e \) for Emma.
- Points for berries: \( 5 \times (E_b + 3) \) for Ava and \( 5 \times E_b \) for Emma.
- Points for time: \( 30 \times E_t \) for Ava and \( 30 \times (E_t + 4) \) for Emma.

Now, let's calculate the total points for each:
- Emma's total points: \( 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \).
- Ava's total points: \( 10(E_e + 8) + 5(E_b + 3) + 30(E_t + 4) \).

Simplify Ava's total points:
\[ 10(E_e + 8) + 5(E_b + 3) + 30(E_t + 4) = 10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120 = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215 \]

Now, we find the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores:
\[ (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215) - (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t) = 215 \]

So, the difference between their two scores is:
\[ \boxed{215} \]"
"The total cost of the four pizzas is 64 dollars. Two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars in total. So, the cost of these two pizzas is 30 dollars.

To find the cost of the remaining two pizzas, we first subtract the cost of the two pizzas from the total cost:
64 - 30 = 34 dollars.

Since the remaining two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2:
34 / 2 = 17 dollars.

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars.

Each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars."
"Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days. So, for those 5 days, they ride:

3 rides/day × 5 days = 15 rides

On the other two days, they ride twice the times they do on the usual days. So, on those days, they ride:

2 × 3 rides/day = 6 rides/day

For the two days, they ride:

6 rides/day × 2 days = 12 rides

Adding the rides from both sets of days:

15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides

So, they ride their bikes 27 times a week.

"Bob originally had 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he ended up with twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as \(W\) and the number of orange fish he bought as \(O\).

Before buying, Bob had 4 white fish and 3 orange fish. After buying, he had \(4 + W\) white fish and \(3 + O\) orange fish. According to the problem, after buying, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish, so we can write the equation:
\[3 + O = 2(4 + W)\]

Simplifying the equation:
\[3 + O = 8 + 2W\]
\[O = 2W + 5\]

We also know that the total number of fish he bought was 17, so:
\[O + W = 17\]

Substituting \(O = 2W + 5\) into the equation \(O + W = 17\):
\[2W + 5 + W = 17\]
\[3W + 5 = 17\]
\[3W = 12\]
\[W = 4\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store."
"First, let's calculate the total distance Andy travels to work in a week. Since he travels 5 miles one way, the round trip is 10 miles. He does this from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days a week. So, the total distance is:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many gallons of gas Andy uses in a week. His car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon, so the gallons of gas used per week is:

\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles/week}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons/week} \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost of the gas. The price of gas is $3 per gallon, so the cost per week is:

\[ 5 \text{ gallons/week} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received from her aunt.

Carrie received ten twenties, which is:

She also received 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount from the quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Carrie received is:
\[ 200 + 35 = 235 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Carrie spent. She spent 3/5 of the twenties and all the quarters.

The amount spent on the twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount spent on the quarters is:
\[ 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:
\[ 120 + 35 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

Final answer:

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25."
"First, we need to determine the total cost of the trip. The trip costs $300.

Next, we calculate how much the school will contribute. Since the school is covering half the cost, we divide the total cost by 2:
\[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

So, the school will contribute $150.

Now, we need to find out how much John still needs to raise. We know John has $50, and the school will contribute $150, so the total amount covered by John and the school is:
\[ 50 + 150 = 200 \]

The total cost of the trip is $300, so the amount John is still missing is:
\[ 300 - 200 = 100 \]

"First, we need to determine the temperature during the night. If it's 33 degrees colder at night compared to the day, and the day temperature is 45 degrees, then the night temperature is:

45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

Next, we need to find out how much the temperature needs to be raised to prevent the pipes from freezing. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. So, we need to raise the temperature from 12 degrees to 32 degrees:

32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees

Since each log of wood burns and heats the house up by 5 degrees, we need to find out how many logs are required to raise the temperature by 20 degrees:

20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing."
"First, we need to determine how many groups of 9 people can be formed from 90 people. We do this by dividing the total number of people by the group size:

\[ \frac{90}{9} = 10 \]

So, there are 10 groups.

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups each brought back 2 seashells. According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the groups brought back seashells. We calculate this as follows:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]

So, 6 groups each brought back 2 seashells. To find the total number of seashells brought back, we multiply the number of groups that brought seashells by the number of seashells each group brought:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is:

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy as \( x \). After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. So, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Then, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. That's 7 days, so:
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the hours together:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. So, the hours she still needs to play are:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

She still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours and then find the difference between these distances.

1. The first car travels at 60 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it will travel:
   \[
   60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. The second car travels at 70 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it will travel:
   \[
   70 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 140 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. The difference in distance between the second car and the first car after 2 hours is:
   \[
   140 \text{ miles} - 120 \text{ miles} = 20 \text{ miles}
   \]

So, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car. 

Final answer:
20 miles"
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the materials before the premium. The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300. So, the total cost of the materials is:

\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

Next, we need to calculate the 30% premium on the total cost of the materials. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.30:

\[ 900 \times 0.30 = 270 \]

Now, we add the premium to the original cost of the materials to find the total amount James paid:

\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

So, the final amount James paid is:

\[ \boxed{1170} \]"
"First, let's calculate the pass rates for each grade.

For third graders:
- 340 out of 500 passed.
- Pass rate = 340 / 500 = 0.68 or 68%.

For fourth graders:
- 40 out of 100 passed.
- Pass rate = 40 / 100 = 0.40 or 40%.

For fifth graders:
- The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders.
- Pass rate = 2 * 0.40 = 0.80 or 80%.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students and the total number of students who passed.

Total number of students:
- Third graders: 500
- Fourth graders: 100
- Fifth graders: 400
- Total = 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000

Total number of students who passed:
- Third graders: 340
- Fourth graders: 40
- Fifth graders: 0.80 * 400 = 320
- Total = 340 + 40 + 320 = 700

Now, we can calculate the overall pass rate:
- Overall pass rate = Total number of students who passed / Total number of students
- Overall pass rate = 700 / 1000 = 0.70 or 70%.

The school's overall pass rate is 70%."
"First, let's calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, we multiply 72 by 2:

\[ 72 \times 2 = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to determine how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12:

\[ 144 \div 12 = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long the mosaic can be, we need to divide the total square inches by the height in inches:

\[ 12 \div 3 = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. 

The final answer is:

\[ 4 \text{ inches} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts, so:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts, so:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 10 quarts left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party was:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ quarts/gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons} \]"
"Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 butterscotch candies, which means he needed to order more to meet the demand. He then ordered 100 more candies.

So, the total number of candies Dale has now is:
100 (initial order) + 100 (additional order) = 200 candies

Dale has already sold 150 candies, so the number of candies he still needs to sell is:
200 (total candies) - 150 (sold candies) = 50 candies

Dale still needs to sell 50 candies."
"At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students on campus.

- By the end of the first month (let's say January), the number of students doubles, so there are \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students.
- By the end of the second month (February), the number of students doubles again, so there are \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students.
- By the end of the third month (March), the number of students doubles again, so there are \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students.
- By the end of the fourth month (April), the number of students doubles again, so there are \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students.
- By the end of the fifth month (May), the number of students doubles again, so there are \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students.

To find the additional students that joined by the end of May, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:

\[320 - 10 = 310\]

So, by the end of May, 310 additional students would have joined above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. During the week, he made $105. To find out the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25} = 420 \]

Next, we need to find out how many branches he climbed on average per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \]

So, on average, Felix climbed 60 branches per day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picked:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\]

Next, we account for the flowers she drops. She drops 1 of each type of flower:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\]

Subtracting the petals of the dropped flowers from the initial total:
\[101 - 22 = 79\]

So, the total number of petals in the vase is:
\[79\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John made 9 S'mores and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so together they used:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Next, we need to account for the marshmallows that were dropped on the ground. They dropped 3 marshmallows, so we subtract these from the total number of marshmallows initially in the bag:

\[ 35 - 3 = 32 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Now, we subtract the marshmallows used by John and DeSean from the remaining marshmallows:

\[ 32 - 18 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

These 14 marshmallows are the ones left to make more S'mores. Since John and DeSean are sharing these remaining marshmallows equally, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2:

\[ 14 \div 2 = 7 \text{ S'mores each} \]

So, each kid can have 7 more S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

Final answer:
\[ 7 \text{ S'mores each} \]"
"Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter. 

Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for 10 minutes each with 1 quarter.

The better friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for 30 minutes with 1 quarter.

They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.

Let's calculate how many quarters each person uses:

- Jack plays for 20 minutes per quarter. In 240 minutes, he can play 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.
- Each of the two friends who play for half as long as Jack can play for 10 minutes per quarter. In 240 minutes, each of them can play 240 / 10 = 24 quarters. Since there are two of them, that's 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.
- The better friend plays for 30 minutes per quarter. In 240 minutes, they can play 240 / 30 = 8 quarters.

Now, let's add up all the quarters:

12 (Jack) + 48 (two friends) + 8 (better friend) = 68 quarters.

So, the total amount of money used is 68 quarters."
"Let's break down the ingredients and their relationships:

1. Let the amount of citrus zest be \( x \) ounces.
2. Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( x \) ounces.
3. The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so the amount of salt is \( 2x \) ounces.
4. The amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt, so the amount of sugar is also \( 2x \) ounces.
5. The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2 \times 2x = 4x \) ounces.

The total amount of all ingredients is 10 ounces. So, we can write the equation:

\[ x + x + 2x + 2x + 4x = 10 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 10x = 10 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 1 \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil, which is \( 4x \):

\[ 4x = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

So, the amount of oil Tanya uses is 4 ounces.

The final numerical answer is:

"John bought 3 goats at $500 each, so the cost for the goats is 3 * $500 = $1500.
He also bought 2 cows at $1500 each, so the cost for the cows is 2 * $1500 = $3000.
The total amount of money John spent is $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

$4500"
"Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. 

First, we add the cupcakes he already has:
8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48 cupcakes

Now, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number he needs:
63 (total needed) - 48 (already has) = 15 cupcakes

Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"First, let's find out how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. So, the number of cars he sells is:

\[ 20\% \times 40 = 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. So, the number of cars he gives away is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving some away. Initially, Joe had 40 cars. After selling 8 cars and giving away 16 cars, the number of cars he remains with is:

\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final number of cars Joe remains with is:

\[ 16 \]"
"First, we need to find out how much money the students raised. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. So, the amount raised by the students is:

$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

Now, we need to divide this amount equally among the 20 students. So, we divide $125,000 by 20:

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

Each student raised $6,250."
"On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as the first day, which is \(8 \div 2 = 4\) hours.

So, the total time Sandy walked over the two days is \(8 + 4 = 12\) hours.

To convert the total time into minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\(12 \times 60 = 720\) minutes.

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars entered, making the total:

50 + 20 = 70 cars

When he got out for lunch, half of the cars left the parking lot. So, the number of cars that left is:

70 / 2 = 35 cars

Therefore, the total number of cars left in the parking lot during lunch break is:

70 - 35 = 35 cars

35"
"John does 30 cycles of work a day. Each cycle has 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20.

First, calculate the earnings per cycle:
5 tasks/cycle * $1.20/task = $6.00/cycle

Next, calculate the daily earnings:
30 cycles/day * $6.00/cycle = $180.00/day

Finally, calculate the weekly earnings for a 7-day week:
$180.00/day * 7 days/week = $1260.00/week

He makes $1260.00 in a full 7-day week."
"In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game. 

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her scores from each game: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

18"
"First, we calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. Since she bought 8 packages of cat food and each package contained 11 tins, we multiply 8 by 11:

\[ 8 \times 11 = 88 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. Since she bought 6 packages of dog food and each package contained 6 tins, we multiply 6 by 6:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food:

\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food."
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \).

Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.

Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have:

Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.

Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards."
"Cindy had 5 green eggs.

She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.

She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.

She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had \(\frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3\) yellow eggs.

To find the total number of eggs, we add the number of each color of egg together:

\(5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27\)

Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"First, let's calculate the refund Milly will receive from Amazon. The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of this amount.

\[ \text{Refund} = 32 \times 0.75 = 24 \]

Next, we need to calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound and $0.08 per mile. The book weighs 4 pounds and needs to be returned 20 miles.

\[ \text{Cost per pound} = 4 \times 0.35 = 1.40 \]
\[ \text{Cost per mile} = 20 \times 0.08 = 1.60 \]
\[ \text{Total shipping cost} = 1.40 + 1.60 = 3.00 \]

Now, we can determine how much money Milly will lose. This is the difference between the book's purchase price and the refund, plus the shipping cost.

\[ \text{Money lost} = 32 - 24 + 3 = 11 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Mulan starts with $40 and her father gives her $100, so she has:

$40 + $100 = $140

She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the cost for the jeans is:

2 * $30 = $60

She also buys a bag for $20. So the total cost of her purchases is:

$60 + $20 = $80

To find out how much money Mulan has left, we subtract the total cost of her purchases from the amount of money she had:

$140 - $80 = $60

Mulan has $60 left."
"Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month.

First week: 8,000 bars
Second week: Half of the first week, so 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars
Third week: Three times the first week, so 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars

Now, let's calculate the total production for the first three weeks:
8,000 (first week) + 4,000 (second week) + 24,000 (third week) = 36,000 bars

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, the production for the fourth week is:
50,000 (total monthly production) - 36,000 (production for the first three weeks) = 14,000 bars

So, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week."
"First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on each activity per week:

1. **Recording TikTok videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Total time spent recording videos per week = \(18 \times 4 = 72\) minutes.

2. **Writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - 2 hours = 120 minutes.

3. **Doing makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week.
   - Total time spent on makeup per week = \(15 \times 6 = 90\) minutes.

Now, let's add up the time spent on all activities per week:
- Total time per week = \(72 + 120 + 90 = 282\) minutes.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly total by 4:
- Total time per month = \(282 \times 4 = 1128\) minutes.

So, Britany spends 1128 minutes on TikTok in a month."
"First, let's break down the costs:

- The base installation cost for 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures is $129.00.
- Angela needs 6 mirrors, which is 2 more than the base 4 mirrors, so that's 2 additional items at $15.00 each.
- Angela also needs 2 chandeliers, which is 1 more than the base 1 chandelier, so that's 1 additional item at $15.00.
- Angela needs 20 pictures, which is 10 more than the base 10 pictures, so that's 10 additional items at $15.00 each.

Now, let's calculate the additional costs:

- Additional mirrors: 2 * $15.00 = $30.00
- Additional chandeliers: 1 * $15.00 = $15.00
- Additional pictures: 10 * $15.00 = $150.00

Adding these to the base cost:

- Total additional cost: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00
- Total cost: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00

The final cost for Angela is $324.00."
"First, let's find out how much Anthony has saved. Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

Eva's savings: $20.00
Anthony's savings: $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find out how much more that is, we calculate 40% of Anthony's savings:

40% of Anthony's savings: 0.40 * $30.00 = $12.00

So, Roy has saved $12.00 more than Anthony. Therefore, Roy's savings are:

Roy's savings: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

Therefore, Roy has $42.00."
"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to follow the chain of relationships given in the problem.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. So, Saskay can lift a mountain \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches high.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. So, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches high.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. So, Naruto can lift a mountain \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches high.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 480 inches to feet by dividing by 12:
\[ \frac{480}{12} = 40 \]

So, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

"Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour. 

For the first part of his journey, he travels for 4 hours. So, the distance covered in the first part is:
8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles

After resting, he travels for another 6 hours. The distance covered in the second part is:
8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

To find the total distance traveled, we add the distances from both parts of the journey:
32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

So, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles."
"First, let's determine the speed of the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can calculate the time it would take for one kangaroo to do the same distance. Since the speed is the same for all kangaroos, the time for one kangaroo would also be 18 hours.

Now, if one kangaroo takes 18 hours to cross the highway, and each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, it means that each turtle will take twice as long to cross the same distance. Therefore, each turtle will take \(18 \times 2 = 36\) hours to cross the highway.

Since the question asks for the time it will take four turtles to cross the highway, and since they are all traveling at the same speed and the distance is the same, the time it takes for four turtles to cross the highway is the same as the time it takes for one turtle, which is 36 hours.

Final answer:

"Kora made 20 dishes.

Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

Together, they made 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140 dishes.

"First, let's calculate the reduced price of the laptop after the trade-in:

Original price of the laptop: $600
Trade-in discount: $200

Reduced price = $600 - $200 = $400

Now, let's add up all the money Erika has:

Money from her part-time job: $150
Money from her mom: $80
Extra money she needs: $50

Total money Erika has, excluding the money in her purse: $150 + $80 + $50 = $280

Since the reduced price of the laptop is $400 and she has $280, the amount of money she has in her purse is:

$400 (reduced price) - $280 (total money she has) = $120

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

Erika has $120 in her purse."
"First, let's calculate the total number of apple slices Adam gets from slicing the apples.

For the large apples:
- Adam has 3 large apples.
- Each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces.
- So, from the large apples, Adam gets \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices.

For the small apples:
- Adam has 5 small apples.
- Each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces.
- So, from the small apples, Adam gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.

Now, let's add the slices from the large and small apples to find the total number of slices:
- Total slices = slices from large apples + slices from small apples
- Total slices = \(15 + 15 = 30\)

Adam eats 15 slices, so we subtract the slices he ate from the total number of slices:
- Slices left = total slices - slices eaten
- Slices left = \(30 - 15 = 15\)

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is 15."
"The farmer currently gets 5 liters of milk a day from one cow. So, from 3 cows, he gets:

5 liters/cow * 3 cows = 15 liters/day

He wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how many more liters he needs:

25 liters/day - 15 liters/day = 10 liters/day

Since each cow produces 5 liters a day, to get the additional 10 liters, he needs:

10 liters/day ÷ 5 liters/cow = 2 cows

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

2"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and then sum these portions.

1. The first glue stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left, so the unused portion is \( 1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6} \). Since the original length of each glue stick is 12 millimeters, the unused length of the first glue stick is \( 12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \) millimeters.

2. The second glue stick has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left, so the unused portion is \( 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \). The unused length of the second glue stick is \( 12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \) millimeters.

3. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left, so the unused portion is \( 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \). The unused length of the third glue stick is \( 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \) millimeters.

Now, we add the unused lengths of all three glue sticks:
\[ 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \]

So, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 millimeters."
"Gabriel wants to buy a car for $10000 and a phone for $800. The total cost is $10000 + $800 = $10800.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200. So, he has a total of $5000 + $200 = $5200.

To find out how much more money Gabriel needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

Gabriel still needs $5600."
"Thea gave the craftsman four $20 bills, which totals to \(4 \times 20 = 80\) dollars.

"Craig starts with 2 twenty dollar bills, which means he has $40.

He buys six squirt guns at $2 each, so the total cost for the squirt guns is:
6 * $2 = $12

He also buys 3 packs of water balloons at $3 each, so the total cost for the water balloons is:
3 * $3 = $9

The total amount spent is:
$12 + $9 = $21

To find out how much money Craig has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
$40 - $21 = $19

Craig has $19 left."
"Jack collected 60 dishes. Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, we can calculate the number of socks Jack has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of socks Jack has} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Peter has twice as many socks as Jack:

\[ \text{Number of socks Peter has} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Peter also has half as many dishes as Jack:

\[ \text{Number of dishes Peter has} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

\[ \text{Total number of socks} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Total number of dishes} = 60 + 30 = 90 \]

\[ \text{Total number of socks and dishes} = 90 + 90 = 180 \]

"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

- 5 students are good at math only.
- The rest of the students are good at both math and English. Since there are 20 students in total and 5 are good at math only, the number of students who are good at both is \(20 - 5 - 8 = 7\).

So, the total number of students good at math is the sum of those good at math only and those good at both math and English.

Total students good at math = 5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12.

"First, let's calculate the total time each group needs to perform, including the time to get on stage and exit the stage. Each group needs 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage. So, the total time for each group is:

\[2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes}\]

Next, we need to account for the intermission. The intermission is 10 minutes long. The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is:

\[2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes}\]

Now, we subtract the intermission time from the total concert time to find out how much time is available for the groups to perform:

\[120 - 10 = 110 \text{ minutes}\]

To find out how many groups can perform, we divide the available time by the time each group needs:

\[110 \div 10 = 11\]

So, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:

\[\boxed{11}\]"
"Brenda's scheme accumulates simple interest at a rate of three-quarters of the original amount per year. The original amount is $300.

First, calculate the interest for one year:
\[ \text{Interest per year} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \]

Since the interest is simple, it will be the same each year. So, for 3 years, the total interest will be:
\[ \text{Total interest for 3 years} = 225 \times 3 = 675 \]

Now, add the total interest to the original amount to find the total amount after 3 years:
\[ \text{Total amount} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

So, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[ 975 \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

- The clothing store has 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts.
- Half of the white shirts have collars, so the number of white shirts with collars is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).
- This means the number of white shirts without collars is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

- Out of the 50 floral shirts, 20 have buttons. Therefore, the number of floral shirts without buttons is \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

Now, we need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars:

- Number of floral shirts with no buttons: 30
- Number of white shirts with no collars: 20

The difference is \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

So, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

"The farmer has 900 eggs. Each tray holds 30 eggs. To find out how many trays he can fill, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

900 eggs ÷ 30 eggs/tray = 30 trays

If he sells each tray for $2.5, then the total earnings will be:

30 trays × $2.5/tray = $75

The farmer will earn $75."
"Mr. Smith initially has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y.

He sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is:
55 - 10 = 45 goats

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X, which means he sold:
2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y

So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
45 - 20 = 25 goats

Altogether, the number of goats left in the two farms is:
45 (from Farm X) + 25 (from Farm Y) = 70 goats

"James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month. In a year, there are 12 months, so he buys:

2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

He spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find out how much he pays on average for each pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the number of pairs:

$2640 / 24 pairs = $110 per pair

So, on average, he pays $110 for each pair of shoes."
"First, calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food:

"First, we need to find out how many rooms make up one-half of the total rooms at KozyInn Motel. Since there are 90 rooms in total, one-half of the rooms would be:

\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total time it would take to clean these 45 rooms. Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, the total time in minutes would be:

\[ 45 \text{ rooms} \times 20 \text{ minutes/room} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

So, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms."
"In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.

By the end of the second year, the total number of homes built is \(12 + 36 = 48\) homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built by the end of the second year, which is \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Therefore, the total number of homes built over the next three years is \(48 + 96 = 144\) homes.

"Let's define the variables for the ages:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( M \) be the age of the mom.
- Let \( A \) be the age of the person asking the question.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The person is three years younger than their brother: \( A = B - 3 \).
2. The person is two years older than their sister: \( A = S + 2 \).
3. The mom's age is one less than three times the brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all their ages is 87: \( A + B + S + M = 87 \).

First, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( A \):
\[ S = A - 2 \]

Next, we substitute \( A \) and \( S \) in terms of \( B \) into the sum of ages equation:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 3 - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]
\[ 6B = 96 \]
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, we can find the age of the person asking the question:

"First, we need to find out how many glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs in total. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we can calculate the total number of glue sticks required as follows:

27 students * 2 glue sticks per student = 54 glue sticks

Next, we need to determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy. Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks per pack = 6.75 packs

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and he expects to have some extra glue sticks left over, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles, so it becomes:
4000 gallons * 2 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so the new amount is:
8000 gallons + 6000 gallons = 14000 gallons.

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons."
"On the first day, the 10 infected people will each infect 6 others, so the number of new infections is 10 * 6 = 60. 

After the first day, the total number of infected people is 10 (initial) + 60 (new) = 70.

On the second day, the 70 infected people will each infect 6 others, so the number of new infections is 70 * 6 = 420.

After the second day, the total number of infected people is 70 (from the first day) + 420 (new) = 490.

On the third day, the 490 infected people will each infect 6 others, so the number of new infections is 490 * 6 = 2940.

"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as \( F \), Anne has as \( A \), and Sofie has as \( S \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \)

3. \( A = F - 12 \)

First, we can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation. Since \( S = A + 25 \) and \( A = F - 12 \), we can express \( S \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \]

Now, substitute \( S \) and \( A \) in the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

"Isaias plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his 300 chickens. First, we calculate how many chickens he plans to sell:

\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens}
\]

Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000 by selling these 180 chickens at $50 each. The total revenue from selling 180 chickens at $50 each is:

\[
180 \times 50 = 9000 \text{ dollars}
\]

This $9000 is the total revenue after accounting for the cost of buying the chickens. Let's denote the cost of buying one chicken as \( x \). The total cost for 180 chickens is \( 180x \). The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[
9000 - 180x = 2000
\]

To find the cost per chicken, we solve for \( x \):

\[
9000 - 2000 = 180x
\]
\[
7000 = 180x
\]
\[
x = \frac{7000}{180} = \frac{700}{18} = \frac{350}{9} \approx 38.89
\]

So, the cost Isaias bought the chickens for is:

\[
\boxed{38.89}

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the total number of glasses they sold by 2 to find out how many Micah sold:
18 / 2 = 9

So, Micah sold 9 glasses of lemonade. To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold:
14 - 9 = 5

Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah."

Next, we need to determine the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and we need to know how many meters of the new rope Sarah plans to buy. Since the problem does not specify the length of the new rope, we will assume she buys the same length as the original rope, which is 20 meters.

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5 \text{ per meter} = \$30 \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the money Sarah gets from selling the original rope to find out how much money she will have left over.

\[ \$40 - \$30 = \$10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$10 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age. If in 10 years she will be 18 years old, then her current age is:

18 - 10 = 8 years old.

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Three times her current age is:

3 * 8 = 24 years old.

Let's denote the number of years from now when her age will be 24 as \( x \). So, in \( x \) years, her age will be:

8 + \( x \) = 24.

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\( x \) = 24 - 8
\( x \) = 16.

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item:

1. **Bacon**: Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total. So, the cost per pack of bacon is:
   \[
   \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]

2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. So, the cost per packet of chicken is:
   \[
   2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet}
   \]
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for chicken is:
   \[
   6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4. Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, so the total cost for strawberries is:
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Apples**: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. So, the cost per pack of apples is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for apples is:
   \[
   7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[
10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. So, the amount of money she has left in her budget is:
\[
65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
5

"Let's denote the usual length of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes.

According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, plus a 15-minute encore. So, the total runtime of the final concert is \( 2x + 15 \) minutes.

We are given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes.

"Argo starts with 200 toys.

He gives away:
- 40 toys to Alyssa
- 80 toys to Bonnie
- 30 toys to Nicky

To find out how many toys Argo has left, we subtract the total number of toys given away from the initial number of toys.

200 - 40 - 80 - 30 = 50

Argo has 50 toys now."
"On Tuesdays, the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesdays, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Fridays, they make twice as many as on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, which is 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

To find the total number of chimichangas made on these three days, we add the number of chimichangas made each day:

125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday) = 500 chimichangas.

500"
"First, we need to find out how many microphones will not find any space to fit in. Since 20% of the 50 microphones won't fit, we calculate 20% of 50:

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 microphones

This means 10 microphones won't find any space to fit in. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs is:

50 - 10 = 40 microphones

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:

40 / 2 = 20 pairs

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage."
"Jerry counts six birds nesting in the bushes. 

2/3 of that number of birds flying overhead is:
2/3 * 6 = 4 birds.

He also counts 3 groups of eight birds each feeding, which is:

"Lani baked 55 cookies and ate 5 of them. So, the number of cookies left is:

55 - 5 = 50 cookies

She then placed these 50 cookies equally into 5 jars. To find out how many cookies are in each jar, we divide the number of cookies by the number of jars:

50 ÷ 5 = 10 cookies

So, there are 10 cookies in each jar."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. So, the total number of petals on the orchids is:

5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. So, the total number of petals on the daisies is:

4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of orchid petals from the total number of daisy petals:

40 petals (daisies) - 25 petals (orchids) = 15 petals

So, the daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids.

"First, let's find out how many indoor plants there are. Since one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we need to find out how many plants are left after removing the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of the remaining 75 plants are outdoor plants. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. To find out how many flowering plants there are, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants is:

\[ 25\% \]"
"A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, and it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. So, we can find the speed of a thingamabob by dividing the speed of a whatchamacallit by 11.

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. So, we can find the speed of a whirligig by multiplying the speed of a thingamabob by 5.

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \times 5 = 55 \text{ meters per second} \]

The whirligig spins at 55 meters per second."
"Let's break down the costs:

1. The salad costs $6.
2. The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, so it costs $6 / 2 = $3.
3. The total cost for the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.
4. Ellen pays $11 in total for her goods, so the cost for the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.
5. Ellen eats 2 carrots a day, so the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

Therefore, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day."
"First, we need to calculate Mark's new hourly wage. He used to make $10 an hour and his pay was raised by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is:

\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week. So, the total number of hours he works in a week is:

\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate his weekly earnings by multiplying his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week:

\[ 12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. We need to find out how much she made from mowing lawns and then subtract that from $80 to find out how much she made from lemonade sales.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

**First Week:**
- Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. So, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
- Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.

**Second Week:**
- Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's. So, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.
- Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.

The total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is the sum of the money she earned from Joe, Kamala, and Alba. Since Joe paid her $6 each week, and she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times and Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times, we can write the total earnings from mowing lawns as:
\[ 6 + 6 + 6 \cdot 3x + 6 \cdot 5x = 12 + 18x + 30x = 12 + 48x \]

We know that the total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is $12 + 48x. Since the total amount she made from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns is $80, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 80 = 12 + 48x + \text{(amount from lemonade sales)} \]

To find the amount from lemonade sales, we need to solve for \( x \) first. Since the total from mowing lawns is $12 + 48x, we can isolate the lemonade sales amount:
\[ \text{Amount from lemonade sales} = 80 - (12 + 48x) = 68 - 48x \]

However, we need to find the value of \( x \) to proceed. Since the total from mowing lawns is $12 + 48x, and we know the total earnings are $80, we can solve for \( x \) by assuming the simplest case where the total from mowing lawns is just the sum of the payments from Joe, Kamala, and Alba:
\[ 12 + 48x = \text{total from mowing lawns} \]

Since the total from mowing lawns is part of the $80, we can directly find the lemonade sales amount:
\[ \text{Amount from lemonade sales} = 80 - 12 = 68 \]

So, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"
"First, let's find Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we add 16 kg to Martin's weight of 55 kg.

Carl's weight = Martin's weight + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 55 kg + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 71 kg

Next, we find Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so we add 8 kg to Carl's weight of 71 kg.

Christian's weight = Carl's weight + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 71 kg + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 79 kg

Finally, we find Harry's weight. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so we subtract 5 kg from Christian's weight of 79 kg.

Harry's weight = Christian's weight - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 79 kg - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 74 kg

The weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"John rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so he rents it out for a total of \(10 \times 3 = 30\) hours a month.

He gets paid $25 an hour, so his total earnings from renting the car are \(30 \times 25 = 750\) dollars a month.

His car payment is $500 a month.

To find his profit, we subtract his car payment from his total earnings: \(750 - 500 = 250\).

So, his profit is \(250\) dollars."
"First, we need to determine how many notebooks Martha originally had. Since Martha ended up with 7 notebooks after buying 5 more, we can find out how many she originally had by subtracting 5 from 7:

Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. Since Martha originally had 2 notebooks, Joseph had:

3 * 2 = 6 notebooks

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph after she bought more notebooks. Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph still has 6 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:

"Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages.

Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.

So, the total pages read by Denise are \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.

Daniel did not read any pages today, so his total remains \(13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract Daniel's total from Denise's total: \(28 - 13 = 15\).

Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.

"Calvin's pot can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. Since Calvin and his wife are adults, they will each have one bowl, which is equivalent to 2 adult bowls. This leaves us with 2 adult bowls of soup (4 total - 2 used by Calvin and his wife).

Since 4 adult bowls are equivalent to 8 child's bowls, 2 adult bowls would be equivalent to 4 child's bowls (8/4 = 2, so 2 adult bowls = 4 child's bowls).

Calvin has two children, and there are 4 child's bowls of soup left. If each child eats one bowl, they will each have 2 bowls of soup (4 bowls / 2 children = 2 bowls per child).

So, each child will be able to have 2 bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we can calculate the material needed for the small and large masks separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the material needed for 20 small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 small mask, she needs \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards of material.
- For 20 small masks, she would need \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards of material.

Next, let's calculate the material needed for 8 large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 large mask, she needs \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards of material.
- For 8 large masks, she would need \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards of material.

Now, we add the material needed for the small and large masks:
- Total material needed = material for small masks + material for large masks
- Total material needed = 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards

So, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."

"To calculate the profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Step 1: Total number of lollipops sold
- Each of the 30 students sold 10 lollipops.
- Total lollipops sold = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops.

Step 2: Total revenue from selling the lollipops

"Martha started collecting shells when she was 5 years old and continued until her 10th birthday. To find out how many shells she collected, we need to calculate the number of months from age 5 to age 10.

From age 5 to age 10 is a span of 5 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 5 years by 12 months per year:

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell every month, she would have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

60 shells"
"Lana has 27 cups in total. She divides these into 3 rows, so each row has:

\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. This means that in each row, the 9 cups are split equally between chamomile and mint tea. Therefore, the number of mint tea cups in each row is:

\[ \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \]

So, the number of mint tea cups in each row is 4.5.

4.5"
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to determine how many trips he can make in 8 hours and then divide the total number of berries by the number of trips.

1. First, calculate the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours:
   - Each trip takes 4 hours.
   - In 8 hours, the sloth can make \( \frac{8}{4} = 2 \) trips.

2. Next, determine how many berries the sloth needs to pick per trip to collect 24 berries in total:
   - The sloth needs to collect 24 berries in total.
   - If he makes 2 trips, he needs to pick \( \frac{24}{2} = 12 \) berries per trip.

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is 12."
"First, we need to determine how much water is in the tank after Anthony and his father fill it. The tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool. Since the pool has 10000 gallons, the tank will have:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water is left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. Over 6 days, the total amount of water emptied from the tank is:

\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Subtracting the amount of water emptied from the initial amount in the tank, we get:

\[ 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ 2000 \text{ gallons} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Colby has spent so far this month.

1. **Movies on Fridays and Saturdays:**
   - He saw 5 movies on Fridays and Saturdays.
   - Each ticket costs $10.
   - Total spent on these movies: \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars.

2. **Movies on other days:**
   - He saw 8 movies on other days.
   - Each ticket costs $7.
   - Total spent on these movies: \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars.

3. **Popcorn:**
   - He had 2 tubs of popcorn.
   - Each tub costs $8.
   - Total spent on popcorn: \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.

4. **Candy:**
   - He had 4 boxes of candy.
   - Each box costs $2.
   - Total spent on candy: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
\[50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = 130\] dollars.

Colby's parents give him $150 each month to spend. So, the remaining money is:
\[150 - 130 = 20\] dollars.

On the last day of the month, it's a Friday, and he wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy. The cost for these items is:
\[8 + 2 = 10\] dollars.

After buying the popcorn and candy, the remaining money is:
\[20 - 10 = 10\] dollars.

Since each movie ticket on a Friday or Saturday costs $10, with $10 remaining, he can see:
\[10 \div 10 = 1\] movie.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[1\] movie."
"First, let's calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. Since a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, each mini cinnamon roll has:
\[ 600 \div 3 = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are:
\[ 200 \times 200 = 40,000 \text{ calories} \]

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. Since a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, each mini blueberry muffin has:
\[ 450 \div 3 = 150 \text{ calories} \]

Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are:
\[ 300 \times 150 = 45,000 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we add the calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins to get the total calories:
\[ 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 \text{ calories} \]

The total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is:
\[ 85,000 \]"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

1. On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
2. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, so that's \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs each day.
3. On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
4. On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's add up the total number of Junebugs removed:

- Monday: 39
- Tuesday: 78
- Wednesday: 78
- Thursday: 48
- Friday: 57

Total Junebugs removed = \(39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57\)

Let's do the addition:

\[39 + 78 = 117\]
\[117 + 78 = 195\]
\[195 + 48 = 243\]
\[243 + 57 = 300\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we need to find the average number of Junebugs removed per day. There are 5 days in the week (Monday to Friday).

Average = \(\frac{\text{Total Junebugs}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{300}{5} = 60\)

The average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance the bus traveled:
- The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance (bus) = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance the car traveled:
- The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance (car) = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, we find the difference in distance:
- Difference = Distance (bus) - Distance (car)
- Difference = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of all the other toys and then subtract that total from the overall number of toys.

1. The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
2. The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
3. The tower of stacking rings has 9 rings.
4. The total number of toys is 62.

First, we add up the number of building blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings:
31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (rings) = 48

Next, we subtract this total from the overall number of toys to find out how many bouncy balls there are:
62 (total toys) - 48 (other toys) = 14

So, the tube of bouncy balls contains 14 bouncy balls.

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: \( P + Pa + J = 100 \).
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: \( Pa = J + 10 \).
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: \( P = Pa + J \).

First, we can substitute the second equation into the third equation:
\[ P = (J + 10) + J \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 \]

Now, we substitute \( Pa = J + 10 \) and \( P = 2J + 10 \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's and Peter's ages:
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is \( 50 \) years.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 50 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of water balloons each person initially received. Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, and she had 1 for herself. So, the initial number of balloons is:

\[ 4 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ balloons per friend} + 1 \text{ balloon for Maria} = 8 + 1 = 9 \text{ balloons} \]

Next, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), the additional number of balloons is:

\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ balloons per person} = 15 \text{ balloons} \]

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons to find the total number of balloons:

\[ 9 \text{ initial balloons} + 15 \text{ additional balloons} = 24 \text{ balloons} \]

So, the total number of balloons the girls had is:

\[ 24 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated and already owned by the charity group.

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so that's \(10 \times 5 = 50\) boxes.
They also have 10 boxes already, so the total number of boxes is \(50 + 10 = 60\) boxes.

Each table can fit 2 boxes worth of stuff. To find out how many tables are needed, we divide the total number of boxes by the number of boxes each table can hold:
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

They already own 15 tables, so the number of new tables they need is:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \]

Final numerical answer:
15"
"To find the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance each person spat their seeds and then find the average of these distances.

First, let's calculate the total distance Zoey spat her seeds:
- Zoey has 40 seeds.
- Each seed is spat 10 feet.
- Total distance for Zoey = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.

Next, let's calculate the total distance Sydney spat her seeds:
- Sydney has 35 seeds.
- Each seed is spat 12 feet.
- Total distance for Sydney = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.

Now, we find the average total distance spat by both:
- Total distance spat by both = 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.
- Number of people = 2.
- Average total distance = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet.

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"First, let's calculate the number of widgets each machine can produce in a month.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
- It makes 60 widgets per hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day.
- In a month with 30 days, it will run \(24 \times 30 = 720\) hours.
- So, the total number of widgets produced in a month is \(60 \times 720 = 43200\) widgets.

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
- It makes 45 widgets per hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day.
- In a month with 30 days, it will run \(24 \times 30 = 720\) hours.
- So, the total number of widgets produced in a month is \(45 \times 720 = 32400\) widgets.

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling these widgets. Each widget sells for $6.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
- Revenue = \(43200 \times 6 = 259200\) dollars.

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
- Revenue = \(32400 \times 6 = 194400\) dollars.

Finally, let's find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000.

Difference in revenue = \(259200 - 194400 = 64800\) dollars.

So, Fern will make \(\boxed{64800}\) dollars more from the Widgeteer 3000 than from the WidgetMaster 9000."
"Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. This means he will stay for 17 hours.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron pays for 24 hours:
- The cost for 24 hours is 1600 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron pays for the first 12 hours and then adds 70 pesos for each additional hour:
- The cost for the first 12 hours is 1000 pesos.
- Cameron stays for 17 hours, so he needs to add 70 pesos for each of the additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5).
- The cost for the additional 5 hours is 5 * 70 pesos = 350 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for 17 hours is 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

Now, let's find out how much Cameron would save by choosing the 17-hour option:
- The cost for 24 hours is 1600 pesos.
- The cost for 17 hours is 1350 pesos.
- The savings is 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos.

Cameron would save 250 pesos."
"First, let's figure out how much hay each sheep needs. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, twice that amount is 10 pounds. So, each sheep needs 10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each needs 5 pounds, so the total for the goats is 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds.

Next, we calculate the total hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each needs 7 pounds, so the total for the sheep is 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds.

Finally, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep to get the total hay needed. So, 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds.

Nate needs 159 pounds of hay."
"First, let's calculate how much money John earned in the week. He earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to account for the expenses. John spends 50 dollars on gas, so his remaining money is:
\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John also wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so his remaining money after the deposit is:
\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to subtract the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs 10 dollars and he buys 5 pencils, so the total cost for the pencils is:
\[ 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} \times 5 \text{ pencils} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from his remaining money gives:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with the remaining 100 dollars. The number of pens he can buy is:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ dollars}}{25 \text{ dollars/pen}} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled out. Craig has spelled out 20 words, each with 15 letters. So, the total number of letters Craig has spelled is:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Next, we need to find out how many letters Craig's brother has spelled. According to the problem, Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled is:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

Now, to find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the number of letters Craig has spelled to the number of letters his brother has spelled:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

So, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

\[ 650 \]"

2. There are 7 rows for each of the 5 different schools.

First, calculate the number of children for one school:
\[ 8 \text{ children/row} \times 7 \text{ rows} = 56 \text{ children/school} \]

Next, calculate the total number of children for all 5 schools:
\[ 56 \text{ children/school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 280 \text{ children} \]

So, the total number of children in the drill is:
\[ 280 \]"
"The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles of apple juice from the coupons is:

9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

There are 29 pupils in the class, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

29 students * 2 bottles/student = 58 bottles

To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles:

900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself."
"Patty's Plumbing charges a fixed visit fee of $40, plus $35 per hour for labor, and the cost of parts.

First, calculate the labor cost:
- The job took 2.25 hours.
- Labor cost is $35 per hour, so for 2.25 hours, the labor cost is \(2.25 \times 35 = 78.75\) dollars.

Next, add the cost of parts:
- The parts cost $60.

Finally, add the visit fee:
- The visit fee is $40.

Now, sum up all the costs:
- Visit fee: $40
- Labor cost: $78.75
- Parts cost: $60

Total cost: \(40 + 78.75 + 60 = 178.75\)

Therefore, Patty charged $178.75."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. James gets 10 CDs, and each CD costs $15. So, the total cost is:

\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount. A 40% discount means James pays 60% of the original price. So, the cost after the discount is:

\[ 150 \times 0.60 = 90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each. The total amount he gets from selling these 5 CDs is:

\[ 5 \times 40 = 200 \]

Now, we need to determine how much money James was out after selling the CDs. The amount he was out is the cost of the CDs after the discount minus the money he got from selling the CDs:

\[ 90 - 200 = -110 \]

Since the result is negative, it means James actually gained $110. However, the question asks how much money he was out, which in this context means the absolute value of the loss, if any. Since he gained money, the answer is:

\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To find out how much Jen will earn, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of root crop and then sum them up.

1. **Yams:**
   - Jen has 6 yams.
   - Each yam is sold for $1.5.
   - Total earnings from yams = 6 yams * $1.5/yam = $9.

2. **Sweet Potatoes:**
   - Jen has 10 sweet potatoes.
   - Each sweet potato is sold for $2.
   - Total earnings from sweet potatoes = 10 sweet potatoes * $2/sweet potato = $20.

3. **Carrots:**
   - Jen has 4 carrots.
   - Each carrot is sold for $1.25.
   - Total earnings from carrots = 4 carrots * $1.25/carat = $5.

Now, we sum up the earnings from all the root crops:
- Total earnings = Earnings from yams + Earnings from sweet potatoes + Earnings from carrots
- Total earnings = $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

So, Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything."
"First, let's calculate the distance James swims before resting. He swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is:

\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes to swim this distance. Since he swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time to swim 12 miles is:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

After swimming, James rests for half as long as his swimming time. So, his rest time is:

\[ \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, James has to swim the remaining 40% of the lake, which is:

\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times 0.40 = 8 \text{ miles} \]

Since he swims the remaining distance at half his original speed, his new speed is:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour} \]

The time to swim the remaining 8 miles is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we add up all the times to find the total time to get across the lake:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:

\[ 17 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, we need to find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has based on the information given.

The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday. 

If Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday, we can calculate seven times that amount:
\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]

Now, we need to subtract 40 from this amount to find out how many loaves the bakery has:
\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \]

So, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread. 

The final numerical answer is:
450"

"First, let's calculate the commission Cayley earns from the New York Times. Each copy of the New York Times costs $5, and he gets a 10% commission on each copy. So, the commission per copy of the New York Times is:

\[ 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \]

Since he sells 6 copies, the total commission from the New York Times is:

\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal. Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15, and he gets an 8% commission on each copy. So, the commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is:

\[ 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \]

Since he sells 10 copies, the total commission from the Wall Street Journal is:

\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \]

Now, we add the commissions from both newspapers to find the total commission:

\[ 3.00 + 12.00 = 15.00 \]

So, the total commission Cayley earns is:

\[ 15.00 \]"
"Deanna is 26 years old.

Since Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old.

Marcus is half of Leo’s age, so Leo’s age is 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as B, A, and D respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. B + A + D = 45 (since the total points scored by the team is 45)
2. B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)
3. B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)

We can use the second equation to express A in terms of B:
A = B - 20

And the third equation to express D in terms of B:
D = B - 10

Now, substitute A and D in the first equation:
B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45

Combine like terms:
3B - 30 = 45

Add 30 to both sides:
3B = 75

Divide by 3:
B = 25

Now, we can find A:
A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

Azibo scored 5 points."
"To find the number of pages in the book, we need to consider the thickness of the book and the number of pages per inch.

Given:
- The book is 1.5 inches thick.
- There are 100 pages per inch.

To find the total number of pages, we multiply the thickness of the book by the number of pages per inch:

\[ 1.5 \text{ inches} \times 100 \text{ pages/inch} = 150 \text{ pages} \]

So, the book has 150 pages."
"First, let's calculate how many hours Vince was stapling reports. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we need to convert these hours into minutes because Vince's stapling rate is given in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals there are in 900 minutes, we divide:

900 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:

60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports

So, Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether."
"Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. That means she usually sleeps for 8 hours. 

On the day in question, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m.

She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

To find out how many minutes she slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time from when she went to sleep until she woke up at 5:55 a.m., and then subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

From 10 p.m. to 2:15 a.m. is 4 hours and 15 minutes, which is 255 minutes.

From 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. is 23 minutes.

From 2:38 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 3 hours and 17 minutes, which is 197 minutes.

So, the total time from when she went to sleep until she woke up is 255 minutes.

Subtracting the 23 minutes she was sleepwalking, we get:

255 minutes - 23 minutes = 232 minutes.

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 232 minutes that day."
"Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. He has two dozen cups, which is 24 cups.

First, calculate the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has:
\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Next, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons:
\[ \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining:
\[ \text{Total utensils} = \text{Number of measuring cups} + \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 24 + 10 = 34 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 34 \]"
"Initially, the hospital has 1000 beds with 1/5 occupied. So, the number of occupied beds is:

1000 * 1/5 = 200 beds

This means the number of unoccupied beds is:

1000 - 200 = 800 beds

Each day, 50 patients are admitted. Over 2 weeks (14 days), the number of new admissions is:

50 * 14 = 700 patients

After 2 weeks, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital would be:

800 - 700 = 100 beds

Final answer:

"Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day.

Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the remainder is:
16 - 7 = 9 emails.

Two-thirds of the remainder (9 emails) are to family:
(2/3) * 9 = 6 emails to family.

The other emails (after accounting for work and family) are:
9 - 6 = 3 emails.

One-third of these other emails are to her boyfriend:
(1/3) * 3 = 1 email to her boyfriend.

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

"First, we need to find out how old Shawna is. Since Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9

Now, we know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. So, we can calculate Shawna's father's age as follows:

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"If Courtney overstated the number of people by 20%, we can calculate the actual number of people who attended the concert by finding the original number before the 20% increase.

Let's denote the actual number of people who attended the concert as \( x \).

According to Kelly, Courtney reported 20% more than the actual number, which means Courtney reported \( x + 0.20x = 1.20x \).

Courtney reported 48 people, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.20x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. If we let the number of balls Jeffrey carried be \( J \), then Jason carried \( 2J \) balls.
2. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.
3. The total number of balls carried by all three boys is the sum of the balls carried by Jeffrey, Jason, and Jordan. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   J + 2J + 4J = 7J
   \]
4. According to the problem, if Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, then Jeffrey would have picked up and carried 1 ball (since Jason carried twice as many as Jeffrey). Therefore, \( J = 1 \).
5. Substituting \( J = 1 \) into the total number of balls equation, we get:
   \[
   7J = 7 \times 1 = 7
   \]

So, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes by the end of the third day after filling in two holes.
3. Use the information that the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day to find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

Let's start with the first step:

- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes.

So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29 \]

By the end of the third day, they had 29 holes. According to the problem, by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes was four times the number of holes at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day was 10. Therefore, by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes was:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Since they had 29 holes at the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \]

So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips. So, the total number of corn chips they got together is:

\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]

Collins got 15 more corn chips than Amora or Lainey, which means Collins got:

\[ 70 + 15 = 85 \]

To find the total number of corn chips, we add the corn chips that Amora, Lainey, and Collins got:

\[ 140 + 85 = 225 \]

So, the total number of corn chips is 225."
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets. The tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The supplies cost $400, so we calculate 50% of $400:

\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

Now, we add this amount to the cost of the supplies to find the total cost of the tickets:

\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

So, the total cost of the tickets is $600.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 600 \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught as \( A \).

According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught. So, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught can be expressed as \( 4A - 13 \).

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokemon Alex has caught can be expressed as \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \).

Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Adding 21 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 9A = 360 \]

Dividing both sides by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokemon, we can find out how many Pokemon Stan has caught. Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon:
\[ 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

So, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is \(\boxed{147}\)."
"Each episode is 20 minutes long. There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, so there are 20 / 2 = 10 episodes in total.

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird flew in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction.

1. The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour:
   \[
   10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. The bird then flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour:
   \[
   2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour:
   \[
   5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles}
   \]

The total distance flown south is the sum of the first and third segments:
\[
300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles}
\]

The total distance flown north is the second segment:
\[
36 \text{ miles}
\]

The net distance flown south is the difference between the southward and northward distances:
\[
410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles}
\]

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[
374 \text{ miles}

"Greta initially made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 12 brownies.

At her office party, she received an additional 1/2 dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.

When she got home, there were 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies.

So, before the surprise party, Greta had a total of:
12 (initial brownies) + 6 (office party brownies) + 48 (surprise party brownies) = 66 brownies.

During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. Since 1 dozen is 12 brownies, 1 1/2 dozen is 18 brownies.

After the surprise party, the number of brownies left is:
66 (total brownies) - 18 (brownies eaten) = 48 brownies.

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day."
"Nani is 8 years old.

His brother is twice Nani's age, so his brother is \(8 \times 2 = 16\) years old.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find 25% of Nani's age, we calculate \(8 \times 0.25 = 2\). So, Nani's sister is \(8 - 2 = 6\) years old.

Now, we add up the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister to find the total age:
\[8 + 16 + 6 = 30\]

The total age of all three family members is 30."
"To find out how long it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and then sum them up.

1. For the 3 racquets strung with synthetic gut:
   - Time = 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes

2. For the 5 racquets strung with polyester string:
   - Time = 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes

3. For the 4 racquets strung with a hybrid set:
   - Time = 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Now, we add up all the times:
- Total time = 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes

So, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all the racquets."
"John needs to buy 4 phones in total. The first 2 phones are at full price, and the remaining 2 phones are at half price.

The cost of the first 2 phones is:
2 phones * $600/phone = $1200

The cost of the next 2 phones (at half price) is:
2 phones * ($600/phone * 0.5) = 2 phones * $300/phone = $600

So, the total cost for all 4 phones is:
$1200 + $600 = $1800

He paid $1800 for all the phones."
"First, we need to find out how many players are on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = \text{Number of players on Carlton's team} + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 13 + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 20 \]

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

\[ \text{Total number of players} = \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} + \text{Number of players on Carlton's team} \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 20 + 13 \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 33 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Total slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Total slats} = 100 \]

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"Mrs. Harrington initially bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave away 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes given away. This leaves her with 12 - 4 = 8 boxes of oranges.

She then kept 1/4 of the remaining 8 boxes for herself. So, she kept 1/4 * 8 = 2 boxes.

This means she sold the rest, which is 8 - 2 = 6 boxes.

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the number of oranges she sold is 6 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 120 oranges.

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges."
"Let's start by figuring out the number of states in the USA. The USA has 50 states.

Now, we need to find out how many states India has. According to the question, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, we calculate half of 50 first:

Half of 50 is 50 / 2 = 25.

Now, we add 4 to this number to find the number of states in India:

25 + 4 = 29.

So, India has 29 states.

Now, to find the total number of states in both countries together, we add the number of states in the USA and India:

50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79.

The total number of states in both countries together is 79."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. Adding these together:

\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

So, the total cost of the books is $39.

Next, we need to determine how much more money Tyler needs to buy the books. He has already saved $14, so we subtract this from the total cost:

\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler needs $25 more to afford the books.

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we need to find out how many hours he has to work to earn $25. We do this by dividing the amount he needs by his hourly wage:

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books.

"Robert has 30 cherries. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.

The total number of cherries is 60. If we subtract the cherries that Robert and Richard have, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has:
60 - 30 (Robert's cherries) - 20 (Richard's cherries) = 10 cherries for Jerry.

Now, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:
30 (Robert's cherries) - 10 (Jerry's cherries) = 20 cherries.

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"First, let's figure out how many boxes of each item Sunny sold on each day.

On Saturday:
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes

On Sunday:
- Gingerbread: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Now, let's calculate the earnings for each day.

Saturday's earnings:
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes * $6 = $60
- Apple pie: 6 boxes * $15 = $90
- Total for Saturday: $60 + $90 = $150

Sunday's earnings:
- Gingerbread: 15 boxes * $6 = $90
- Apple pie: 15 boxes * $15 = $225
- Total for Sunday: $90 + $225 = $315

Total earnings for two days:
- Saturday + Sunday: $150 + $315 = $465

Sunny earned $465 for the two days."
"Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour she's outside. If she will be outside for 4 hours a day, she will use:

1 ounce/hour * 4 hours/day = 4 ounces/day

Over 8 days, she will use:

4 ounces/day * 8 days = 32 ounces

Since each bottle contains 8 ounces of sunscreen, the number of bottles she will need is:

32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles

Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"The blue car costs $100.

To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of $100 and subtract it from $100.

40% of $100 is:
\[ 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \]

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. Therefore, the price of the red car is:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

The total cost of both cars is:
\[ 100 + 60 = 160 \]

Final numerical answer:

"When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. This means his dad will be 48 years old at that time. Since Emil will be 24, and he is currently 19, he will turn 24 in 5 years. So, his dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old.

Emil will also be twice as old as his brother when he turns 24. This means his brother is currently 24 / 2 = 12 years old, because in 5 years, his brother will be 12 + 5 = 17 years old.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now. Emil's dad is 43 years old, and his brother is 12 years old. So, the sum is 43 + 12 = 55.

"Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.

Adrianne's sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, which means her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.

Adrianne's friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which means her friend gave her 20 * 2 = 40 beads.

To find out how many beads Adrianne has altogether, we add the beads from her mother, sister, and friend:

20 (from mother) + 30 (from sister) + 40 (from friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."

"First, let's find out how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:

20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after removing the football players:

30 students - 6 students = 24 students

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. So, we calculate:

25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students

Now, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members to find out how many students are leaving early:

6 football players + 6 cheerleaders or band members = 12 students

Therefore, 12 students are leaving early."
"First, we need to determine the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size five boots, we can calculate the size of Charlie's boots as follows:

\[ \text{Size of Charlie's boots} = 5 \times \text{Size of Sophie's boots} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Next, we need to find the average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie. The average is calculated by adding the sizes of their boots and then dividing by 2:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Size of Charlie's boots} + \text{Size of Sophie's boots}}{2} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

So, the average size of the shoe worn by the two is:

"First, we need to determine the total space required for each plant, including the space between them. Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Therefore, the total space required for each plant is:

1 foot (for the plant) + 1.5 feet (space between plants) = 2.5 feet

Next, we need to calculate how many plants can fit in the 111 feet long flower bed. We do this by dividing the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each plant:

111 feet / 2.5 feet per plant = 44.4 plants

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 44 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so we need to find out how many more plants she needs to buy:

44 plants - 17 plants = 27 plants

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:

27 plants * $6 per plant = $162

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed."

"First, let's calculate the cost for one hanging basket.

For each basket:
- Katherine wants to add 3 petunias, and each petunia costs $3.00.
- She also wants to add 2 sweet potato vines, and each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.

The cost for the petunias in one basket is:
3 petunias * $3.00 per petunia = $9.00

The cost for the sweet potato vines in one basket is:
2 sweet potato vines * $2.50 per vine = $5.00

So, the total cost for one basket is:
$9.00 (for petunias) + $5.00 (for sweet potato vines) = $14.00

Since Katherine has 5 hanging baskets, the total cost for all baskets is:
5 baskets * $14.00 per basket = $70.00

Therefore, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil. Subtract the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. With 3 pounds of soil left, they can plant:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

"First, we need to calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck.

25% of $2,000.00 is calculated as:
\[ 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

So, Jessica sets aside $500.00 each month for shoes.

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with her monthly savings. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

The number of pairs of shoes she can buy each month is:
\[ \frac{500}{1000} = 0.5 \]

Since she can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0.5 pairs each month, which means she can buy 1 pair every 2 months.

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so we divide 12 by 2:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

Final answer:
\[ 6 \]"
"Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute and saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, which means she can saute 3 shrimp per minute.

To peel 90 shrimp, it will take her:
90 shrimp ÷ 6 shrimp/minute = 15 minutes

To cook 90 shrimp, since she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we need to find out how many sets of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp:
90 shrimp ÷ 30 shrimp/set = 3 sets

Since it takes her 10 minutes to saute one set of 30 shrimp, for 3 sets it will take:
10 minutes/set × 3 sets = 30 minutes

Now, we add the time to peel and the time to saute:
15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (sauteing) = 45 minutes

It will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

3. **Determine the time between the first and second sightings of the comet:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
   - The time between the first and second sightings is 75 years.

4. **Calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and the time between the first and second sightings is 75 years, then Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time."
"To calculate the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the frequency of each type of check and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill**: Once per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes 12 checks for the electric bill.
2. **Gas bill**: Once per month. Again, 12 checks for the gas bill.
3. **Church**: Twice per month. So, 2 checks per month times 12 months equals 24 checks.
4. **Pest and lawn service**: Quarterly. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes 4 checks for the pest and lawn service.

Now, we add all these up:

- Electric bill checks: 12
- Gas bill checks: 12
- Church checks: 24
- Pest and lawn service checks: 4

Total checks per year = 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52

Buford writes 52 checks per year."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the number of flights the first plane makes in a day. We know that the second plane makes 44 trips, and these trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, the first plane makes twice as many trips as the second plane.

\[ \text{Number of flights by the first plane} = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Next, we need to determine how many of these 88 flights are to France. According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. This means that the remaining one-quarter of the flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany.

First, calculate the number of flights to Greece:

\[ \text{Flights to Greece} = \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \]

Now, the remaining flights are:

\[ \text{Remaining flights} = 88 - 66 = 22 \]

These remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France is:

\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

So, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:

\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 20 * 2 = 40 seconds.
The combined howling time of Tobias and Chikote is 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.
Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 60 seconds.
The total howling time for all three wolves is 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.
To convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60: 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"First, let's figure out how much money Adam received from his father. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, and his mother gave him $6, his father gave him:

\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

So, Adam received $12 from his father. Adding the money from his mother and father together, we get:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

Adam's trousers cost $30, and he received $18 from his parents. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the amount he received from the total cost of the trousers:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

So, Adam had to contribute \(\boxed{12}\) dollars from his savings."
"First, let's find the average age of the group. The total age of the children is 20, and there are 4 children. So, the average age is:

\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, so Helene's age is:

\[ \text{Helene's age} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we know the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene. Akbar is 3 years old, Alessandro is 4 years old, and Helene is 10 years old. Let's denote Wilfred's age as \( W \). The total age of the children is the sum of their individual ages:

\[ 3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 17 + W = 20 \]

To find \( W \), we subtract 17 from both sides of the equation:

\[ W = 20 - 17 = 3 \]

So, the age of Wilfred is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, we need to find out the total amount of money collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund. 

The amount collected from neighbors is $500.
The amount collected from the online fund is $1500.

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute. The lawyer is going to donate three times the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund.

So, the lawyer's contribution is:
\[ 3 \times 2000 = 6000 \]

Therefore, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute:
\[ 6000 \]

6000"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, the bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ 50 \]"
"Let's assume the total watermelon is 100 units for simplicity.

If each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, we can denote the size of each kid's slice as \(x\) units. Therefore, each adult's slice would be \(2x\) units.

Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total slices can be represented as:
\[2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x\]

This total must equal the whole watermelon, which is 100 units:
\[8x = 100\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[x = \frac{100}{8} = 12.5\]

So, each kid gets 12.5 units, and each adult gets \(2 \times 12.5 = 25\) units.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Adult's slice}}{\text{Total watermelon}}\right) \times 100\]

Substituting the values:
\[\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{25}{100}\right) \times 100 = 25\%\]

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on inpatient rounds. Since he has 9 inpatients and it takes 20 minutes per inpatient, the total time for rounds is:

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes/inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the appointments. He has 10 appointments, each taking 30 minutes:

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes/appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 480 minutes to hours:

\[ 480 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic. Subtracting the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments from the total time at the clinic gives us the time left for updating records:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up all the time required for each step and then subtract this total from 5:00 pm.

1. Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Baking the cake: 30 minutes
3. Cooling the cake: 2 hours (120 minutes)
4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required = 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

180 minutes is equal to 3 hours.

If Jordan wants to have the cake ready to serve at 5:00 pm, we need to subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm.

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter.
2. Use the total number of chocolate bars sold to find out how many bars are in each box.

First, let's add the number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter:
- Lisa sold 3.5 boxes.
- Peter sold 4.5 boxes.

Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

They sold 64 chocolate bars together. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:

64 chocolate bars ÷ 8 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box.

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per session for the studio.
2. Calculate the total cost per day for the studio.
3. Calculate the total cost per week for the studio.
4. Calculate the total cost per month for the studio.

First, let's calculate the cost per session for the studio:
- The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
- The cost per student per session is $1.50.
- With 10 students, the cost per session for students is \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost per session is \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost per day for the studio:
- The studio is rented 3 days a week.
- So, the total cost per day is \(40 \times 3 = 120\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total cost per week for the studio:
- There are approximately 4 weeks in a month.
- So, the total cost per week is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) dollars.

Finally, let's calculate the total cost per month for the studio:
- The total cost per month is \(480 \times 1 = 480\) dollars.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"First, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes. Since Peter has 4 boxes and a total of 64 chocolate bars, we can divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes to find the number of chocolate bars per box for Peter.

\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box for Peter} = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Next, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes. Since Martha has 7 boxes and a total of 56 chocolate bars, we can divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes to find the number of chocolate bars per box for Martha.

\[ \text{Chocolate bars per box for Martha} = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha. We do this by subtracting the number of chocolate bars per box for Martha from the number of chocolate bars per box for Peter.

\[ \text{Difference} = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

8"
"First, let's find out how many female porcupines there are. Since the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. So, the total number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Babies born per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. Adding the babies born in a year to the initial population gives us the total number of porcupines after a year:

\[ \text{Total porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

1490"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, so we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

So, the volume of the pool is:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

Let's calculate this step by step:

\[ 25 \times 14 = 350 \]
\[ 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \]

So, the pool needs 8260 gallons of water.

Finally, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $826."
"There are 9 red sticks.

The number of blue sticks is 5 more than the red sticks, so there are 9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks.

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so there are 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.

To find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34 sticks.

So, they have 34 sticks in total."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

For Matteo:
- Speed = 55 miles per hour
- Time = 4 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

For Shandy:
- Speed = 45 miles per hour
- Time = 10 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we find the difference in the distances:
- Difference = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of students**: 3000

2. **Students over 16 years old**: Half of the total students

"Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps in one hour.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(14 / 2 = 7\) laps in one hour.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps in one hour.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run: \(10 - 5 = 5\).

Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn."
"On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity. The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons} \]

Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda did on the first day:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the total amount of water pumped into the tank on the first day is:

\[ 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons} \]

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the total amount of water pumped into the tank on the second day is:

\[ 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons} \]

The total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days is:

\[ 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons} \]

The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so the amount of water remaining to fill the tank is:

\[ 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is:

"To find the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge.

1. **Final Charge Calculation:**
   - After 8 hours, the power bank was at 28% charge.

2. **Charge Before the Second Phase:**
   - For the last 3 hours, the power bank lost 7% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge before the last 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge would be \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know this equals 28%, so:
     \[
     x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{0.28}{(0.93)^3} \approx \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
     \]

3. **Charge Before the First Phase:**
   - For the first 5 hours, the power bank lost 9% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge before the first 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge would be \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know this equals 0.348, so:
     \[
     y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348
     \]
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{0.348}{(0.91)^5} \approx \frac{0.348}{0.624032} \approx 0.557
     \]

So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 55.7%."
"First, let's calculate Janet's total earnings per hour from both wages and tips:

- Wages: $10/hour
- Tips: $15/hour

Total earnings per hour = $10 + $15 = $25/hour

Next, we calculate her weekly earnings if she works 40 hours a week:

Weekly earnings = $25/hour * 40 hours/week = $1000/week

Now, let's find out how much Janet wants to save for the down payment:

- Cost of the car: $10000
- Down payment: 20% of $10000

Down payment = 20% * $10000 = 0.20 * $10000 = $2000

Finally, we calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000:

Number of weeks = $2000 / $1000/week = 2 weeks

So, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased.

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: \(2 \times 1 = 2.00\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost so far:
\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount he has is:
\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

Final numerical answer:

"Anne kept 2 packs of sweets for herself. Since each pack contains 60 pieces, the total number of pieces she kept is:
2 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 120 pieces

The box originally had 15 packs, so the number of packs left to give to her friends is:
15 packs - 2 packs = 13 packs

Each of these 13 packs contains 60 pieces, so the total number of pieces given to her friends is:
13 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 780 pieces

Anne has 10 friends, and she wants to give them the sweets equally. So, the number of pieces each friend receives is:
780 pieces / 10 friends = 78 pieces

Each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply a 5% increase each year to the original price of $120.

1. **First Year:**
   - Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
   - New price = $120 + $6 = $126

2. **Second Year:**
   - Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
   - New price = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

3. **Third Year:**
   - Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
   - New price = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounding $138.915 to the nearest integer, we get $139.

**Final Answer:**

"Olivia uploaded 72 pictures in total. She divided these pictures equally into 8 albums. To find out how many pictures are in each album, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

72 pictures ÷ 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Out of these 8 albums, 3 albums contain only selfies and 2 albums contain only portraits. This means there are 3 albums of selfies and 2 albums of portraits, which totals 5 albums dedicated to either selfies or portraits.

Since each album contains 9 pictures, the total number of selfies is:

3 albums × 9 pictures per album = 27 selfies

And the total number of portraits is:

2 albums × 9 pictures per album = 18 portraits

So, the total number of portraits and selfies is:

27 selfies + 18 portraits = 45 pictures

"First, let's determine the price of a large stuffed animal. Since a small stuffed animal costs $4 and a large one costs three times that, a large stuffed animal costs \(3 \times 4 = 12\) dollars.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \(L\). According to the problem, Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is \(2L\).

The total earnings from the sales are $120. The earnings from the large stuffed animals are \(12L\) dollars, and the earnings from the small stuffed animals are \(4 \times 2L = 8L\) dollars. Therefore, the total earnings can be expressed as:
\[12L + 8L = 20L\]

We know the total earnings are $120, so we can set up the equation:
\[20L = 120\]

Solving for \(L\):
\[L = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Since the number of small stuffed animals sold is \(2L\), we have:
\[2L = 2 \times 6 = 12\]

So, Teresa sold \(\boxed{12}\) small stuffed animals."
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first need to calculate the daily consumption and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

So, the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the family is:
5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day.

Now, to find out the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
11 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 77 sandwiches/week.

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"Suzanne sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so she earned 80 * $1 = $80 from the cookies. She also sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so she earned 60 * $4 = $240 from the cupcakes. In total, she earned $80 + $240 = $320. She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away 2 * $10 = $20. Therefore, the amount of money she has left is $320 - $20 = $300. 

She has $300 left from her earnings."
"The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

The total number of eggs hidden was 100. If 60 eggs were found by the Smith twins, then 100 - 60 = 40 eggs were left.

All the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends, so the friends found 40 - 10 = 30 eggs.

The friends found 30 eggs."
"First, let's determine how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day. We know that:

- One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
- With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
- With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which is \(24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36\) pounds per day.

Now, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine with steel pickaxes in a month with 30 days. 

The amount of ore one dwarf can mine in a day with a steel pickaxe is 36 pounds. Therefore, in 30 days, one dwarf can mine \(36 \times 30 = 1080\) pounds of ore.

Since there are 40 dwarves, the total amount of ore mined in 30 days is \(1080 \times 40 = 43200\) pounds.

So, the final numerical answer is:
43200"
"To find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the price per sandwich for each package and then use that to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

First, let's find the price per sandwich for the first package:
- The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3.
- So, the price per sandwich is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) dollars.

Next, let's find the price per sandwich for the second package:
- The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6.
- So, the price per sandwich is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) dollars.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages, which is $1.5.

Now, we can find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
- If the price per sandwich is $1.5, then the cost of 8 sandwiches is \( 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \) dollars.

So, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."
"First, we need to determine how much Tom still needs to pay for the bedroom set after selling his old one. 

The cost of the new bedroom set is $3000, and Tom sells his old one for $1000. So, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining $2000 each month. To find out how much he needs to pay per month, we calculate 10% of $2000:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month. 

Final answer:
\[ 200 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. Sally had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst. So, the number of red balloons that burst is:

\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]

This means the number of red balloons remaining is:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the 12 yellow balloons. So, the number of yellow balloons released is:

\[ 12 \times 0.50 = 6 \]

This means the number of yellow balloons remaining is:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons. So, the number of blue balloons she added is:

\[ 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school. She had 15 red balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons. Therefore, the total number of balloons is:

\[ 15 + 6 + 6 = 27 \]

So, the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school is:

\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.5
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
   - Probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework in this scenario: 0%

2. **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.4
   - Combined probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving an extension: \(0.5 \times 0.4 = 0.2\) or 20%
   - If the normal teacher gives an extension, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
   - Probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework in this scenario: 0%

3. **Normal Teacher without Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.6
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus not getting a personal extension: 80% or 0.8
   - Combined probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension, and Marcus not getting a personal extension: \(0.5 \times 0.6 \times 0.8 = 0.24\) or 24%
   - If Marcus does not get a personal extension, he has to turn in his homework.
   - Probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework in this scenario: 100% or 1

Now, we sum up the probabilities of the scenarios where Marcus has to turn in his homework:

- Probability of having to turn in homework with a substitute teacher: 0%
- Probability of having to turn in homework with a normal teacher giving an extension: 0%
- Probability of having to turn in homework with a normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus not getting a personal extension: 24%

Total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:
\[ 0\% + 0\% + 24\% = 24\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is **24%**."
"First, we need to determine the total number of seats that are not reserved for graduates and faculty. The Fine Arts Center has a total of 6000 seats. Out of these, 950 seats are for graduates and 300 seats are for faculty. So, the number of seats available for guests is:

6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 seats

These 4750 seats are to be split equally among the graduates. If we assume there are G graduates, then each graduate would receive:

4750 / G tickets

Since the question does not specify the number of graduates (G), we can't provide a numerical answer. However, if we assume there are 100 graduates (for the sake of providing a numerical answer), then each graduate would receive:

4750 / 100 = 47.5 tickets

So, each graduate would receive 47.5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"First, let's figure out how many medium-sized jelly beans Grandpa can eat. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, and it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill him up, we can calculate the number of medium-sized jelly beans as follows:

\[ 75 \times 2 = 150 \]

So, Grandpa can eat 150 medium-sized jelly beans.

Next, we need to determine how many small jelly beans this is equivalent to. We know that eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized jelly bean. Therefore, to find out how many small jelly beans 150 medium-sized jelly beans are equivalent to, we can use the following calculation:

\[ 150 \times 3 = 450 \]

So, Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 450 \]"
"Melissa works for a total of 6 hours a day for 3 days, which means she works 6 * 3 = 18 hours in total.

She is paid $15 per day, so for 3 days, she earns 15 * 3 = $45.

She also has to pay $3 for parking each day, so for 3 days, she spends 3 * 3 = $9 on parking.

Her net earnings after parking expenses are 45 - 9 = $36.

To find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her net earnings by the total hours worked: 36 / 18 = $2 per hour.

So, Melissa makes $2 per hour after expenses."
"Ted buys 3 books for $16 each, so the cost of the books is 3 * $16 = $48. He also buys 3 pencils for $6 each, so the cost of the pencils is 3 * $6 = $18. 

To find the total amount spent, we add the cost of the books and the pencils together: $48 + $18 = $66.

So, Ted spent a total of $66."
"To determine how many seconds it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - The number of intervals between bottles is \( \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \) intervals.
   - Since there is a bottle at the start and one at the end of each interval, the total number of bottles is \( 8 + 1 = 9 \).

2. **Calculate the total time to set off all the soda fountains:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next.
   - To set off all 9 bottles, he needs to make 8 moves (since the first bottle doesn't require a move).
   - The total time is \( 8 \text{ moves} \times 5 \text{ seconds/move} = 40 \text{ seconds} \).

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is **40 seconds**."
"First, we need to find out how many apples Uncle Franky has in total. Since there are forty apples in one box and he ordered two boxes, we can calculate the total number of apples as follows:

40 apples/box * 2 boxes = 80 apples

Next, we need to determine how many packs of apples he can make with these 80 apples, given that each pack contains eight apples. We can calculate the number of packs as follows:

80 apples / 8 apples/pack = 10 packs

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples."
"First, we calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese. Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese at $11 per pound. So, the cost for the Parmesan cheese is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$11/\text{pound} = \$22 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the mozzarella cheese. Amor buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese at $6 per pound. So, the cost for the mozzarella cheese is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$18 \]

Now, we add the costs of the Parmesan and mozzarella cheese to find the total cost:
\[ \$22 + \$18 = \$40 \]

Amor starts with $50. To find out how much money she has left after buying the cheese, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from the amount of money she started with:
\[ \$50 - \$40 = \$10 \]

So, the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of loans Jim takes out during his 4 years of college. He takes out $50,000 per year, so:

\[ 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \]

Next, we need to determine Jim's income before and after college. Before college, he earned $25,000 per year. After college, his income tripled, so his new income is:

\[ 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college. Since he would have worked for 4 years at $25,000 per year, his total income would have been:

\[ 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000 \]

After college, he will earn $75,000 per year. We need to find out how long it will take for him to earn the equivalent of the $200,000 in loans plus the $100,000 in lost income. The total amount he needs to earn is:

\[ 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000 \]

Since he earns $75,000 per year after college, we can find the number of years it will take to earn $300,000 by dividing the total amount by his annual income:

\[ \frac{300,000}{75,000} = 4 \]

So, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

\[
\boxed{4}

"First, we need to determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces Jim needs. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. The fabric pieces are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece is:
6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet

And the width of each fabric piece is:
8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Next, we calculate the area of one fabric piece. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
Area = length × width

For one fabric piece:
Area = 8 feet × 10 feet = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
Total area = 80 square feet × 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric."
"On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. One-fifth of Monday's deliveries is \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \). So, on Tuesday, they delivered \( 85 + 17 = 102 \) letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. Twice Tuesday's deliveries is \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \). So, on Wednesday, they delivered \( 204 + 5 = 209 \) letters.

To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we add the deliveries from each day: \( 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \).

The final numerical answer is 736."
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost for each type of salad and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the chicken salad:
- 10 people want chicken salad.
- Each chicken salad costs $6.50.
- So, the total cost for chicken salad is \(10 \times 6.50 = 65\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the pasta salad:
- 6 people want pasta salad.
- Each pasta salad costs $6.
- So, the total cost for pasta salad is \(6 \times 6 = 36\) dollars.

Now, we add the two amounts together to get the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of chicken salad + cost of pasta salad
- Total cost = \(65 + 36 = 101\) dollars.

So, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is 101 dollars."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
   - Adding $1: \(10 + 1 = 11\).
   - So, he won $11 in the second race.

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - 1.5 times the amount won in the second race: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\).
   - So, he lost $16.5 in the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount won and lost:

- Total amount lost: \(5 + 16.5 = 21.5\).
- Total amount won: \(11\).

The net amount lost is:
\[21.5 - 11 = 10.5\]

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races (3):
\[\frac{10.5}{3} = 3.5\]

So, the average loss per race is \(\boxed{3.5}\)."
"To find the total population of South America based on the given information, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of cities in South America: There are 26 countries, and each country has 5 cities. So, the total number of cities is \(26 \times 5 = 130\).
2. Determine the population of each city: Each city has 1000 people.
3. Calculate the total population: Multiply the number of cities by the population of each city. So, \(130 \times 1000 = 130,000\).

Therefore, the total population of South America, based on the given information, is 130,000 people."
"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. We'll use inches for this calculation since the final heights of Cole and Xavier are to be compared in inches.

Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's original height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
After growing 3 inches, Xavier's current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches. So, Cole's current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem, the second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount of money is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( \boxed{420} \)."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of days the painters worked:**
   - There are 3 weeks, and each week has 7 days.
   - So, the total number of days is \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.

2. **Calculate the total number of hours each painter worked per day:**
   - A day has 24 hours.
   - The painters worked for \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day.
   - So, the hours worked per day by each painter is \(\frac{3}{8} \times 24 = \frac{3 \times 24}{8} = \frac{72}{8} = 9\) hours.

3. **Calculate the total number of hours each painter worked over 3 weeks:**
   - Each painter worked 9 hours per day.
   - Over 21 days, the total hours each painter worked is \(9 \times 21 = 189\) hours.

So, the final numerical answer is:
189 hours."
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, we can find the number of balls in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is 10."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year.

Starting price in 2007: $20,000

For 2008:
Depreciation = 21% of $20,000 = 0.21 * $20,000 = $4,200
Price in 2008 = $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800

For 2009:
Depreciation = 21% of $15,800 = 0.21 * $15,800 = $3,318
Price in 2009 = $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482

For 2010:
Depreciation = 21% of $12,482 = 0.21 * $12,482 = $2,621.22
Price in 2010 = $12,482 - $2,621.22 = $9,860.78

The price of the car in 2010 is $9,860.78."
"There are 50 books in total in the library.

Half of them are written in English, so:
50 / 2 = 25 English books.

10% of them are written in German, so:
50 * 10% = 5 German books.

The rest are written in Spanish. To find out how many are in Spanish, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:
50 - 25 - 5 = 20 Spanish books.

"Bernice has already driven 325 kilometers. The total distance from San Diego to New York City is 1955 kilometers. To find out how many kilometers she still needs to drive, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance.

1955 kilometers - 325 kilometers = 1630 kilometers

Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers."
"Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. To find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days, we multiply 8 cups by 30 days:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we divide the total number of cups by 16 to find out how many gallons she drinks in 30 days:

\[ 240 \text{ cups} \div 16 \text{ cups/gallon} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."

   - The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
   - Therefore, the number of tiles needed is \(200 \text{ SqFt} \div 1 \text{ SqFt/tile} = 200 \text{ tiles}\).

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each tile costs $12.
   - The total cost is \(200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12/\text{tile} = \$2400\).

**Final Answer:**
The cost to renovate your kitchen floor will be \$2400."
"First, we need to calculate the new monthly cost after the 60% increase. 

The normal cost is $120 a month. A 60% increase on $120 is calculated as follows:
\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the new monthly cost is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Now, to find out how much James pays a year, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12 (months in a year):
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year."
"Greg has 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed. He changes the sheets every week.

For the twin beds:
- He has 4 twin beds, so he needs 4 sets of twin sheets per week.
- The machine can wash 2 sets of twin sheets at a time.
- Therefore, he needs 4 / 2 = 2 loads for the twin sheets per week.

For the king size bed:
- He has 1 king size bed, so he needs 1 set of king sheets per week.
- The machine can wash 1 set of king sheets at a time.
- Therefore, he needs 1 load for the king sheets per week.

In total, he needs 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads of laundry per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so:
- 3 loads per week * 52 weeks = 156 loads of laundry per year.

"On Saturdays, Jill and her friends watch 4 movies. On Sundays, they watch half the number of movies, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend (Saturday and Sunday), they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

In 4 weeks, they would watch 6 movies/weekend * 4 weekends = 24 movies.

"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so his collection increased to:
100 (previous collection) + 50 (collected last year) = 150 stickers.

This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as last year, which is:
2 * 50 (last year's collection) = 100 stickers.

Adding this year's collection to his last year's total:
150 (last year's total) + 100 (this year's collection) = 250 stickers.

So, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection."
"Imma feeds her 3 cats a total of 60 grams of cat food per meal, twice a day. So, each day, the total amount of cat food consumed by her cats is:

60 grams/meal × 2 meals/day = 120 grams/day

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:

720 grams ÷ 120 grams/day = 6 days

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 6 days."
"Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \(7 \times 2 = 14\) slices. 

To find the total number of slices they ate, we add up the slices each person ate: \(10 + 7 + 14 = 31\).

Total slices eaten: 31"
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, we can denote Betsy's part as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for the meal is the sum of both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. So, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, we calculate:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long."
"Let's break down the costs:

1. **Cast**: $200
2. **Doctor's Visit**: The doctor charges $300/hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. **Painkillers**: $4/pill for 30 pills, so the cost is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. **Parking**: $6/hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours, so the cost is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add all these costs together:

$200 (cast) + $150 (doctor's visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"First, we need to find out how many emails James doesn't need to respond to each day. Since 20% of the emails don't require any response, we calculate 20% of 80 emails:

20% of 80 = 0.20 * 80 = 16 emails

So, James doesn't need to respond to 16 emails each day. This means he needs to respond to the remaining emails:

80 emails - 16 emails = 64 emails

James responds to 64 emails each day. To find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:

64 emails/day * 5 days = 320 emails

Therefore, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."
"On Monday, 32 classes visited.
On Tuesday, twice as many as Monday, so \(32 \times 2 = 64\) classes.
On Wednesday, three times as many as Monday, so \(32 \times 3 = 96\) classes.
On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
On Friday, 25 classes visited.

To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we add the numbers together:

\(32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247\)

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."
"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we first need to calculate the total score for all tests and then divide by the number of tests.

John's scores are:
- 100, 100, 100 (first 3 tests)
- 80 (4th test)

First, we add up all the scores:
100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

Next, we divide the total score by the number of tests, which is 4:
380 ÷ 4 = 95

So, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them.

\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \]

So, the glee club ate 14 pizzas. This means they have:

\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \]

pizzas left.

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ate. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

pizzas. They ate 80% of these pizzas:

\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]

So, the football team ate 32 pizzas. This means they have:

\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \]

pizzas left.

Now, we add the remaining pizzas from both the glee club and the football team:

\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \]

So, the final number of pizzas left is:

14"
"Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. So, the number of big coupons is 700 * 2 = 1400.

The cost to mail each small coupon is 5 cents, so the total cost for small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

The cost to mail each big coupon is 15 cents, so the total cost for big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of small and big coupons: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

Since 100 cents make a dollar, the total cost in dollars is 24500 cents / 100 = 245 dollars.

So, Anthony spends 245 dollars on postage total."
"First, let's figure out how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, so:

10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, so Sidney had:

7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches left.

Then, Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches, so the total number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney had was:

3 + 3 = 6 meatball sub sandwiches.

Since each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the 6 meatball sub sandwiches is:

6 * 4 = 24 meatballs.

So, the final numerical answer is:

24 meatballs."
"Mr Hezekiah had 20 trucks dispatched for delivery. A quarter of these trucks had mechanical failures. 

First, calculate the number of trucks that had mechanical failures:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]

So, 5 trucks could not deliver the fertiliser. This means the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:
\[ 15 \times 20 = 300 \]

Total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day:
\[ 300 \]"
"Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants, so he needs 6 pounds of butter.

The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter he buys, he gets a second pound at half the price.

The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound. So, for the first pound, he pays $4.00, and for the second pound, he pays $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.

For 6 pounds of butter, he will have 3 pairs of pounds (since 6 pounds can be divided into 3 pairs). So, the cost for each pair is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

Therefore, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter is 3 pairs * $6.00 per pair = $18.00.

The final cost to purchase 6 pounds of butter is $18.00."
"First, let's calculate the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- 25 classmates
- 7 girls in her dance class
- 13 family members

Total guests invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Since 4 people said they could not come, the actual number of guests attending the party is:

45 - 4 = 41

The cost to rent the theater is $125, and there is an additional $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20 guests. So, the number of additional guests is:

41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is:

21 guests * $6/guest = $126

Adding the rental fee and the cost for the additional guests:

$125 + $126 = $251

The final cost of the party is $251."
"First, let's figure out how much money Maggie and Riza each had initially.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has three-quarters of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Maggie's initial money} = 60 \]

To find Maggie's initial money, we solve for it:

\[ \text{Maggie's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80 \]

So, Maggie initially had $80.

Next, Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has two-thirds of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Riza's initial money} = 60 \]

To find Riza's initial money, we solve for it:

\[ \text{Riza's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90 \]

So, Riza initially had $90.

Now, let's calculate how much money each of them has left:

Maggie has $60 left.
Riza has $60 left.

To find the total amount of money they have left together, we add their remaining amounts:

\[ 60 + 60 = 120 \]

So, the two of them have $120 left."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys each day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Now, we add the bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys to find out how many bananas they eat together each day:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Since the total number of bananas Mr. Robles buys is enough to feed the three monkeys for a week, and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas is:
\[ 315 \text{ bananas} \]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we subtract the number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas and then divide by 7 (since the bananas are for a week):
\[ \text{Total bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week} = 315 - (24 \times 7) \]
\[ 24 \times 7 = 168 \]
\[ 315 - 168 = 147 \]

So, the third monkey eats 147 bananas in a week. To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide 147 by 7:
\[ \frac{147}{7} = 21 \]

Therefore, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

21"
"Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed 250 pieces. Then, he started and finished another 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed all 500 pieces of the second puzzle.

So, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is:

250 (from the first puzzle) + 500 (from the second puzzle) = 750 pieces.

750 pieces."
"First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for 15 roses is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which totals:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she needs an additional $5 to cover the cost. The florist can only give change in quarters, and since a quarter is worth $0.25, we need to find out how many quarters make up $5:

\[ \$5 \div \$0.25 = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

So, Jenny leaves with 20 quarters. 

Final answer:
\[ 20 \]"
"To find out how much money Terry makes in total, we need to calculate the earnings from each item and then add them together.

1. **Milkshakes:**
   - Terry sells 6 milkshakes at $5.50 each.
   - Total from milkshakes = 6 * $5.50 = $33.00

2. **Burger Platters:**
   - Terry sells 9 burger platters at $11 each.
   - Total from burger platters = 9 * $11 = $99.00

3. **Sodas:**
   - Terry sells 20 sodas at $1.50 each.
   - Total from sodas = 20 * $1.50 = $30.00

Now, we add the totals from each item to find the overall total:

- Total money made = $33.00 (milkshakes) + $99.00 (burger platters) + $30.00 (sodas) = $162.00

**Final numerical answer:**
$162.00"
"Let's break down the schedule of the trains:

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes.
2. The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves, which is 40 minutes after it arrives. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, so it stays for 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.
3. The third train arrives an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves, which is 100 minutes after the first train arrives. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it stays for 0 minutes.
4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 120 minutes after the first train arrives. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, let's calculate the total waiting time for Paul:

- The first train arrives in 10 minutes, and Paul will wait for the fourth train.
- The first train stays for 20 minutes, so the second train arrives 40 minutes after the first train arrives.
- The second train stays for 5 minutes, so the third train arrives 100 minutes after the first train arrives.
- The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so the fourth train arrives 120 minutes after the first train arrives.

Paul will wait for 120 minutes minus the 10 minutes until the first train arrives, which is 110 minutes.

So, Paul will wait for his train for a total of 110 minutes."
"Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

She needs a total of 200 toothpicks for the sculpture. So, the number of toothpicks she still needs is:

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

If she continues to save 10 toothpicks each week, the number of weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks is:

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

So, it will take her 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks."
"First, let's find out how much Mr. Rogers paid for the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price, which is $2000.

To find 75% of $2000:
\[ 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

So, Mr. Rogers paid $1500 for the watch.

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for. So, we need to calculate 120% of $1500.

To find 120% of $1500:
\[ 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

So, Mr. Rogers' friend bought the watch for $1800.

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price of the watch, which is $2000.

The discount amount is:
\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

To find the percentage discount:
\[ \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%."
"To find out how many jellyfish 5 springs would create in 4 hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many jellyfish one spring creates in one second.
2. Calculate how many jellyfish one spring creates in one hour.
3. Calculate how many jellyfish one spring creates in 4 hours.
4. Calculate how many jellyfish 5 springs create in 4 hours.

Step 1: Since every second a spring creates a new jellyfish, one spring creates 1 jellyfish per second.

Step 2: There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are \(60 \times 60 = 3600\) seconds in one hour. Therefore, one spring creates 3600 jellyfish in one hour.

Step 3: In 4 hours, one spring would create \(3600 \times 4 = 14400\) jellyfish.

Step 4: If 5 springs are working at the same rate, they would create \(14400 \times 5 = 72000\) jellyfish in 4 hours.

Frankie's score was 195."
"James walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles. Then he walked back home, another 2 miles. So, he walked a total of 4 miles. Since he walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it took him to walk 4 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1 hour

It took James 1 hour to reach the store."
"First, let's calculate how many bananas Jenny gets from buying 10 bunches. Since each bunch averages 4 bananas, she gets:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas/bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we calculate the cost if she bought these bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80, so for 40 bananas, the cost would be:

\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80/\text{banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since she bought 10 bunches and each bunch costs $3.00, the total cost is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00/\text{bunch} = \$30.00 \]

To find out how much money she saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:

\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Jenny saved \(\$2.00\) by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \).

According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can write:
\[ H = S + 60 \]

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can also write:
\[ S + H = 100 \]

Now, we substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we solve for \( S \):
\[ 2S = 100 - 60 \]
\[ 2S = 40 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ 20 \]"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to determine the growth rate per year. 

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. So, the growth per year is:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \]

Now, to find out how many inches it will grow in 13 years, we multiply the yearly growth by 13:
\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"First, let's calculate the number of each type of bike sold.

1. **Trekking Bikes:**
   - Half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes.
   - Number of Trekking bikes = \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \)

2. **BMX Bikes:**
   - 15% of the 300 bikes sold were BMX bikes.
   - Number of BMX bikes = \( 300 \times 0.15 = 45 \)

3. **MTB Bikes:**
   - The rest of the bikes sold were MTB bikes.
   - Number of MTB bikes = Total bikes - Trekking bikes - BMX bikes
   - Number of MTB bikes = \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \)

Next, let's calculate the earnings from each type of bike.

1. **Earnings from Trekking Bikes:**
   - Price of one Trekking bike = $450
   - Total earnings from Trekking bikes = \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \)

2. **Earnings from BMX Bikes:**
   - Price of one BMX bike = \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \)
   - Total earnings from BMX bikes = \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \)

3. **Earnings from MTB Bikes:**
   - Price of one MTB bike = $500
   - Total earnings from MTB bikes = \( 105 \times 500 = 52500 \)

Finally, let's sum up the total earnings from all the bikes sold.

- Total earnings = Earnings from Trekking bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from MTB bikes
- Total earnings = \( 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = 131250 \)

Therefore, Marcel earned a total of $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month."
"The farmer makes 5 bales of hay each hour. Over 6 hours, the farmer makes:
5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales

The truck picks up 3 bales of hay each hour. Over 6 hours, the truck picks up:
3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales

To find out how many bales are left in the field, we subtract the bales picked up by the truck from the bales made by the farmer:
30 bales - 18 bales = 12 bales

So, the number of bales of hay left in the field is:
12 bales"
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long.

So, the total time spent in classes each weekday is:
\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total time spent in classes during the weekdays is:
\[ 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 1600 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on these days.

First, we find \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his total weekday class time:
\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he spends this amount of time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time for the weekend is:
\[ 100 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent in classes during the weekdays and the extra learning time on the weekend to get the total weekly learning time:
\[ 1600 \text{ minutes} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours John spends learning each week is:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} \]"
"The ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony, which is 24 feet high. With each bounce, the ball reaches \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its previous height.

First, we calculate the height of the first bounce:
\[ \text{Height of the first bounce} = 24 \times \frac{2}{3} = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the height of the second bounce:
\[ \text{Height of the second bounce} = 16 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{32}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Converting \(\frac{32}{3}\) to a decimal gives:
\[ \frac{32}{3} \approx 10.67 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the ball on its second bounce is approximately 10.67 feet.

10.67"
"The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many bags of apples were sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings based on the price per bag.

First, we know that each bag contains 10 apples. The orchard sold a total of 2000 apples. To find out how many bags were sold, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we know that each bag is sold for $5. To find out the total earnings, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag."
"Let's work backwards from the information given.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat.
2. Before the Allosaurus ate, the remaining meat was twice that amount because the velociraptors scavenged half of what was left. So, before the Allosaurus ate, there were \(270 \times 2 = 540\) kilograms of meat.
3. Before the velociraptors scavenged, the remaining meat was twice that amount because the velociraptors took half. So, before the velociraptors scavenged, there were \(540 \times 2 = 1080\) kilograms of meat.
4. Before the T-Rex ate, the triceratops had twice that amount because the T-Rex ate half of it. So, before the T-Rex ate, there were \(1080 \times 2 = 2160\) kilograms of meat.

The triceratops had 2160 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate."
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each of these walls has an area of:
\[ 10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each of these walls has an area of:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding the areas of all four walls together, we get the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \times 12 = 144 \]

So, the cost to paint the room is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each type of soda remaining after Ellen and her brother took their sodas.

Ellen started with a case of 12 sodas and shook 3 of them. So, there are 3 shaken sodas and 9 unshaken sodas.

Ellen took 1 unshaken soda for herself, so now there are 8 unshaken sodas left.

Ellen's brother then took 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. After he took his sodas, there are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas left.

Now, Ellen's friend comes along and takes a soda. The total number of sodas left is 2 (shaken) + 6 (unshaken) = 8 sodas.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left. So, the probability is:

\[ \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is:

\[ 25\% \]"
"The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the second train is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

To find out how far apart they are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

For the first train:
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour × 3 hours = 180 miles

For the second train:
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour × 3 hours = 90 miles

Now, we add the distances together to find out how far apart they are:
Total distance = 180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

After 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart."
"First, let's calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.

- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days.
- April 1st to April 19th is 19 days.
- Total days = 31 + 19 = 50 days.

Billy takes 20% of these days off. So, we need to find 20% of 50 days.

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.

This means Billy works on 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day. So, the number of people he helps per day is:

2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day.

Now, we need to find out how many people he helps in 40 days:

6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people.

So, Billy helps 240 people."
"To find out how many people were inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry.

First, let's calculate the number of people that the buses could carry:
- There were 12 buses, and each bus carried 35 people.
- So, the total number of people that the buses could carry is \(12 \times 35 = 420\).

Next, let's calculate the number of people that the cars could carry:
- There were 20 cars, and each car carried 3 people.
- So, the total number of people that the cars could carry is \(20 \times 3 = 60\).

Now, we add the number of people that the buses and cars could carry to find the total number of people:
- Total number of people = \(420 + 60 = 480\).

Therefore, the number of people inside the church is 480."
"To find out how old Jeff is, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. First, we know that Mike is 24 years old.
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike. So, we subtract 4 from Mike's age to find Martha's age:
   \[
   24 - 4 = 20
   \]
   Therefore, Martha is 20 years old.
3. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. So, we add 10 to Martha's age to find Jeff's age:
   \[
   20 + 10 = 30
   \]
   Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old.

The final answer is:
\[
30

"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute

Time = Length / Speed
Time = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute

Time = Length / Speed
Time = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time:
Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide
Difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

It takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and two 15-minute breaks each day. 

First, let's calculate the total time for the lunch and breaks in one day:
- Lunch: 30 minutes
- Break 1: 15 minutes
- Break 2: 15 minutes

Total time per day = 30 + 15 + 15 = 60 minutes

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, Bobby's lunch and breaks add up to 1 hour per day.

Now, let's calculate the total time over 5 days:
- Total time over 5 days = 1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours

So, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours."
"First, we need to find out how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate the distance Micah ran as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (\text{Amber's distance} + \text{Micah's distance}) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (8 + 28) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - 36 \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"First, let's calculate the initial balance after the return:

Initial charge: $85.00
Cost of returned item: $15.00

Balance after return: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan after the 20% discount:

Original price of frying pan: $20.00
Discount on frying pan: 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

Price after discount: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of the set of towels after the 10% discount:

Original price of towels: $30.00
Discount on towels: 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00

Price after discount: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the balance after the return:

Balance after return: $70.00
Cost of frying pan: $16.00
Cost of towels: $27.00

New balance: $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

Final balance on her credit card: $113.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the total number of jellyfish in the tank be \( J \).
2. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{J}{5} \).
3. A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. So, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15} \).
4. We know that 6 jellyfish changed color. Therefore, \( \frac{J}{15} = 6 \).

Now, we solve for \( J \):

\[
\frac{J}{15} = 6
\]

Multiply both sides by 15:

\[
J = 6 \times 15 = 90
\]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( 90 \).

"Chris is 4 years old.

Ben is two times older than Chris, so Ben is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) years old.

Caroline is three times older than Ben, so Caroline is \(8 \times 3 = 24\) years old.

Caroline is 24 years old."
"First, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year. She saves 20% of her $100,000 salary.

\[ \text{Annual Savings} = 100,000 \times 0.20 = 20,000 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Lauren will have saved by the time she retires. She plans to save for 20 years.

\[ \text{Total Savings} = 20,000 \times 20 = 400,000 \]

Now, we need to figure out how much money Lauren will need each year during her retirement. She plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.

\[ \text{Annual Retirement Expense} = 100,000 \times 0.40 = 40,000 \]

To find out how many years Lauren can live on her savings, we divide her total savings by her annual retirement expense.

\[ \text{Years of Retirement} = \frac{400,000}{40,000} = 10 \]

Since Lauren plans to save for 20 years and can live on her savings for 10 years, she needs to work for 20 years to save enough for 10 years of retirement.

\[ \text{Years to Work} = 20 \]

So, Lauren needs to work for 20 more years."
"Marty starts with 100 centimeters of ribbon. He needs to cut this ribbon into 4 equal parts first.

1. To find the length of each of these 4 parts, we divide 100 centimeters by 4:
   \[
   \frac{100}{4} = 25 \text{ centimeters}
   \]
   So, each of the 4 parts is 25 centimeters long.

2. Next, each of these 25 centimeter parts needs to be divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we divide 25 centimeters by 5:
   \[
   \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ centimeters}
   \]
   So, each of the final parts is 5 centimeters long.

The final answer is:
\[
5 \text{ centimeters}

"To find the total number of students in the school, we start by understanding that 40% of the total population is 240 boys. We can set up the equation as follows:

40% of total students = 240 boys
0.40 * total students = 240

To find the total number of students, we divide both sides by 0.40:

total students = 240 / 0.40
total students = 600

Now, we know that 40% of the students are boys, so the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of the total number of students:

60% of total students = 0.60 * 600
60% of total students = 360

So, the number of girls in the school is 360."

"To find the average height of the heels at the party, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total height of all the heels.
2. Divide the total height by the number of women to find the average.

First, let's calculate the total height of all the heels:
- There are 3 women wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- There are 3 women wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

Now, add these two totals together to get the overall total height of the heels:
\[12 + 6 = 18\] inches.

Next, we need to find the average height of the heels. There are 6 women in total, so we divide the total height by 6:
\[\frac{18}{6} = 3\] inches.

Therefore, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in June. June typically has 30 days.

First, let's calculate how many miles Soledad plans to hike each day if she hikes twice a day, covering 125 miles each time:
- Miles per session: 125 miles
- Sessions per day: 2
- Total miles per day: 125 miles/session * 2 sessions/day = 250 miles/day

Now, let's calculate the total miles she would hike in June if she hikes 250 miles each day:
- Total days in June: 30 days
- Total miles per day: 250 miles/day
- Total miles in June: 250 miles/day * 30 days = 7,500 miles

Soledad needs to hike 9,300 miles in June, but if she hikes 250 miles each day, she would only hike 7,500 miles. The difference is:
- Total miles needed: 9,300 miles
- Total miles she would hike: 7,500 miles
- Additional miles needed: 9,300 miles - 7,500 miles = 1,800 miles

To find out how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we divide the additional miles needed by the number of days in June:
- Additional miles needed: 1,800 miles
- Total days in June: 30 days
- Additional miles per day: 1,800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles/day

Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

60 miles/day"
"To find out how much the store will have received after all the balls are sold, we need to calculate the total revenue from each color of ball and then sum these amounts.

1. **Red Balls:**
   - Number of red balls: 3
   - Cost per red ball: $9
   - Total revenue from red balls: \( 3 \times 9 = 27 \)

2. **Blue Balls:**
   - Number of blue balls: 11
   - Cost per blue ball: $5
   - Total revenue from blue balls: \( 11 \times 5 = 55 \)

3. **Green Balls:**
   - Number of green balls: 25
   - Cost per green ball: $3
   - Total revenue from green balls: \( 25 \times 3 = 75 \)

Now, we sum the revenues from all the balls:
\[ 27 + 55 + 75 = 157 \]

The store will have received \(\boxed{157}\) dollars after all the balls are sold."
"Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples in total.

Peter wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \, \text{kg} \]

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \, \text{kg} \]

Together, Peter and Paul want:
\[ 3 \, \text{kg} + 4 \, \text{kg} = 7 \, \text{kg} \]

So, James will have:
\[ 12 \, \text{kg} - 7 \, \text{kg} = 5 \, \text{kg} \]

James will have 5 kg of apples left."
"The temperature started at 2 degrees Celsius. It dropped by 8 degrees, so the temperature became 2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius. Then it increased by 3 degrees, so the temperature became -6 + 3 = -3 degrees Celsius.

Subtracting the total amount spent from the total amount he had:

\[ 32 - 24 = 8 \]

So, Raymond has $8 left."
"Anna started with $16 and has $2 left after her purchase. This means she spent $16 - $2 = $14 in total. She had already spent $4 before buying the 2 books, so she spent $14 - $4 = $10 on the 2 books. Since both books cost the same amount, each book cost $10 / 2 = $5.

Each of the books cost $5."
"Last year, there were 50 students in the calligraphy class. This year, there was a 20% increase in enrollment.

To find the increase in students:
20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10

50 (last year's students) + 10 (increase) = 60

This year, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class."
"To solve this, we need to find the rate at which the light blinks and then use that rate to determine the time for 459 blinks.

First, we find the rate of blinking:
- The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes.
- So, the rate is \( \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \).

Next, we use this rate to find out how long it will take for 459 blinks:
- If the light blinks 51 times per minute, then for 459 blinks, the time required is \( \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} \).

Now, we perform the division:
- \( \frac{459}{51} = 9 \text{ minutes} \).

So, it will take 9 minutes for the light to blink 459 times."
"First, let's count the initial number of each type of fish in Tate's garden pond:

- Male guppies: 4
- Female guppies: 7
- Male goldfishes: 3

Next, let's add the new fish Tate buys:

- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fishes:

- Total male fishes: 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11
- Total female fishes: 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16

Finally, we find the difference between the number of female and male fishes:

- Difference: 16 (female) - 11 (male) = 5

Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes."
"Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours.

Dior took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia to do laundry, so Dior took 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 hours (since it's mentioned ""over 4 hours longer,"" we can assume the minimum over 4 hours is 5 hours, but to be precise, we use 9 hours as a clear example).

Now, we add up the time each person took:
Amalia: 4 hours
Megan: 6 hours
Dior: 9 hours

Total time = 4 + 6 + 9 = 19 hours.

"John drives 2 hours each way at 70 mph. To find the distance for one way, we use the formula distance = speed × time. So, for one way, the distance is 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles. Since it's a round trip, we double this distance: 140 miles × 2 = 280 miles for one visit. John visits his parents twice a month, so we multiply the round trip distance by 2: 280 miles × 2 = 560 miles.

560 miles"
"Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. In 7 days, she will walk:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. So, if Sofie walks 70 miles, Brian will walk half of that distance:

\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers and then determine how many toys the fifth worker must produce to meet the order.

First, let's calculate the number of toys produced by the first two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- They work for 10 hours.
- So, each of these workers produces \(6 \times 10 = 60\) toys.
- Together, they produce \(60 \times 2 = 120\) toys.

Next, let's calculate the number of toys produced by the next two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- They work for 10 hours.
- So, each of these workers produces \(4 \times 10 = 40\) toys.
- Together, they produce \(40 \times 2 = 80\) toys.

Now, let's add the toys produced by the first four workers:
- The first two workers produce 120 toys.
- The next two workers produce 80 toys.
- Together, they produce \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys.

The total order is 400 toys, and the manufacturer still needs 20 toys to be able to ship the order. This means the first four workers have produced \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

Now, we need to find out how many toys the fifth worker produced. Since the first four workers produced 380 toys, the fifth worker must have produced the remaining toys:
- The fifth worker produced \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours they worked:
- The fifth worker worked for 10 hours.
- So, the fifth worker produces \(180 \div 10 = 18\) toys per hour.

Therefore, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour."
"First, we need to find the weight of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds.

1. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:

   \]

2. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. Now, we add the weights of all three dogs to find the total weight:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds}
   \]

The total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is 105 pounds."
"Let's work backwards from the information given:

1. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob. So, Kris originally had \(9 + 7 = 16\) stickers.
2. Luis gave all 16 stickers to Kris, which means Luis had 16 stickers before giving them to Kris.
3. Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris. So, the 16 stickers Luis gave to Kris were the other half of his stickers. Therefore, Luis originally had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.
4. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, and Luis had 32 stickers. So, Seth originally had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

Therefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of M&M John has:

3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces

Next, we need to find out how many M&M he has in total:

30 ounces * 30 M&M per ounce = 900 M&M

Now, if he puts 10 M&M in each small bag, we can calculate the number of small bags he can make:

900 M&M / 10 M&M per small bag = 90 small bags

"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly half the way around the Earth, we first need to calculate half of the Earth's circumference.

The Earth's circumference is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as \( A \), by Madeline as \( M \), by Camden as \( C \), and by Sarah as \( S \).

2. According to the problem, Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so \( A = M \).

3. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so \( C + S = 30 \).

4. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so \( C = S + 12 \).

5. The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56, so \( A + M + C + S = 56 \).

Since \( A = M \), we can rewrite the total as \( 2A + C + S = 56 \).

We also know from the third point that \( C = S + 12 \), and from the second point that \( C + S = 30 \). Substituting \( C = S + 12 \) into \( C + S = 30 \), we get:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 9 \) back into \( C = S + 12 \):
\[ C = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Now we know \( C = 21 \) and \( S = 9 \). We can substitute these values into the total equation \( 2A + C + S = 56 \):
\[ 2A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Since \( A = M \), \( M = 13 \) as well.

Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from 200 crayons. We do this by dividing 200 by 8:

200 ÷ 8 = 25 groups

Since each group of crayons will go into a box, Nik will need 25 boxes.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce and there are 200 crayons:

200 crayons × 1 ounce/crayon = 200 ounces

Now, we calculate the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces and there are 25 boxes:

25 boxes × 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together:

200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound:

400 ounces ÷ 16 ounces/pound = 25 pounds

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds."
"First, let's calculate how much of the tree can be turned into logs. John can make logs out of 80% of the 80-foot tree. So, the length of the logs he can get is:

\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs he can get from 64 feet of wood. We divide 64 by 4:

\[ 64 \div 4 = 16 \text{ logs} \]

From each log, he cuts 5 planks. So, the total number of planks he can get is:

\[ 16 \times 5 = 80 \text{ planks} \]

He sells each plank for $1.2. Therefore, the total amount of money he makes is:

\[ 80 \times 1.2 = 96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{96} \]"
"Valerie earns $5000 per month. Her brother earns twice Valerie's salary, which is $5000 * 2 = $10000 per month.

The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is $5000 + $10000 = $15000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is $15000 * 2 = $30000 per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is $5000 (Valerie) + $10000 (brother) + $30000 (mother) = $45000 per month.

45000"
"First, let's determine Grandma's walking speed on the beach. Since she spends 40 minutes walking 2 miles on the beach, we can calculate her speed as follows:

\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

This means Grandma walks 1 mile in 20 minutes on the beach. Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:

\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes her to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk:

\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, we get the total time for the 3-mile walk:

\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Jane has been saving $4 each week for 8 weeks. So, she has saved a total of $4 * 8 = $32.

To find out how many more weeks it will take for her to save a total of $60, we need to calculate the difference between her goal and what she has already saved.

The difference is $60 - $32 = $28.

Since she saves $4 each week, we divide the difference by the weekly savings to find the number of weeks needed.

$28 / $4 = 7 weeks.

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To find the total number of blue birds in the trees, we need to add up the number of birds in each tree.

First, we calculate the number of blue birds in the 3 trees that each had 7 blue birds:
3 trees * 7 blue birds/tree = 21 blue birds

Next, we calculate the number of blue birds in the 2 trees that each had 4 blue birds:
2 trees * 4 blue birds/tree = 8 blue birds

Finally, we add the number of blue birds in the 1 tree that had 3 blue birds:
1 tree * 3 blue birds/tree = 3 blue birds

Now, we add all these numbers together to get the total number of blue birds:
21 blue birds + 8 blue birds + 3 blue birds = 32 blue birds

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"First, let's figure out how many marbles Bob originally has.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. So, if we subtract the 24 marbles he receives from the total of 60, we can find out how many marbles he originally has.

60 - 24 = 36

So, Bob originally has 36 marbles.

Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, we subtract 10 from his original amount:

36 - 10 = 26

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, he will have 26 marbles."
"Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. After pouring 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle, the remaining water in that mug is still 33 degrees. He then pours one ounce from the second mug, and after this, he can drink the water. This means that the water from the second mug, even after pouring out one ounce, must be at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T \) degrees. When Donny pours one ounce from this mug, the temperature of the remaining water must be at least 40 degrees. Since the temperature of water is generally uniform throughout the mug, the temperature of the remaining water in the second mug must be at least 40 degrees before any water is poured out.

Therefore, the second mug must have been at least 40 degrees before any water was poured out. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{40}

"First, let's calculate the total cost for 4 packs of bagels without the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, so for 4 packs, the cost is:

\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount. A 10% discount on $40.00 is:

\[ 40 \times 0.10 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the discounted total cost is:

\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total. Since each pack contains 9 bagels and he orders 4 packs, the total number of bagels is:

\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

To find the cost per single bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:

\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, the cost per single bagel is:

\[ 1 \text{ dollar} \]"
"First, let's figure out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem states that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So, we calculate:

23 - 5 = 18 scoops

Next, we need to determine how many potatoes are needed to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, we calculate:

6 - 3 = 3 potatoes for 2 scoops

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 1 scoop. Since 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, we divide 3 by 2:

3 / 2 = 1.5 potatoes per scoop

Finally, we calculate how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops:

18 * 1.5 = 27 potatoes

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes."
"Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days, so that's 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.
Then he increases it to 5 eggs a day for 30 days, so that's 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.
In total, Chester eats 90 + 150 = 240 eggs in 60 days.
Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens.
So, 240 eggs / 12 = 20 dozens.

20 dozens"
"First, let's find out how many red jelly beans there are. Since there are twice as many red jelly beans as green jelly beans, and there are 17 green jelly beans, we can calculate the number of red jelly beans as follows:

\[ \text{Number of red jelly beans} = 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Next, we know the total number of jelly beans in the jar is 60. We can find the number of blue jelly beans by subtracting the number of green and red jelly beans from the total number of jelly beans:

\[ \text{Number of blue jelly beans} = 60 - (\text{Number of green jelly beans} + \text{Number of red jelly beans}) \]
\[ \text{Number of blue jelly beans} = 60 - (17 + 34) \]
\[ \text{Number of blue jelly beans} = 60 - 51 \]
\[ \text{Number of blue jelly beans} = 9 \]

So, the number of blue jellybeans is 9."

"First, let's find out how many men and women were on the bus initially.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 14 parts (5 + 9) of the total passengers, 5 parts are men and 9 parts are women.

The total number of passengers is 84. To find out how many parts each represent, we divide the total number of passengers by the total number of parts in the ratio:

\[ \text{Each part} = \frac{84}{14} = 6 \]

So, the number of men on the bus is:

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \]

And the number of women on the bus is:

\[ 9 \times 6 = 54 \]

If 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

\[ 54 - 20 = 34 \]

So, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to calculate the number of sunflowers sold from both the individual sunflowers and the bouquets, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day:
- The price of one sunflower is $2.
- Faraday earns $26 from individual sunflowers per day.
- Therefore, the number of individual sunflowers sold per day is $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers.

Next, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:
- The price of one bouquet is $8.
- Faraday earns $56 from bouquets per day.
- Therefore, the number of bouquets sold per day is $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets.

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold from bouquets per day is:
- 7 bouquets * 12 sunflowers per bouquet = 84 sunflowers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day:
- Individual sunflowers: 13
- Sunflowers from bouquets: 84
- Total sunflowers per day: 13 + 84 = 97 sunflowers.

Finally, to find out how many sunflowers were sold after 3 days:
- Total sunflowers after 3 days: 97 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 291 sunflowers.

Next, we need to find out how many rocks Adam sells. He sells 60% of his inventory.

\[ \text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \]

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling these rocks. Each rock is sold for $7.

\[ \text{Revenue} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \]

Adam's initial investment was $100. To find out how much money he loses, we subtract the revenue from the initial investment.

\[ \text{Loss} = 100 - 84 = 16 \]

"To find out how many days it will take Lauren to create all the picture scenes, we need to calculate the total number of days required for each size of picture scenes and then sum them up.

1. **Large-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
   - Number of days required = \( \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) days.

2. **Medium-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
   - Number of days required = \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) days.

3. **Small-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.
   - Number of days required = \( \frac{49}{7} = 7 \) days.

Now, we add up the days required for each type of picture scene:
- Total days = 9 days (large) + 6 days (medium) + 7 days (small) = 22 days.

So, it will take Lauren 22 days to create all of the picture scenes."

"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then divide the total distance by the total time.

First, let's calculate the total distance:
- Sid traveled 110 miles initially.
- Then, Sid traveled an additional 140 miles.
- Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.

Next, let's calculate the total time:
- Sid took 2 hours for the first part of the trip.
- Sid took an additional 3 hours for the second part of the trip.
- Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

Now, we can find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
- Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.

The average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket.
2. Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners.

First, the probability of winning for the first ticket is given as 20%, or 0.20.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning for the second ticket is:
\[ 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

Next, we need to find the probability that both tickets are winners. Since the events are independent, we multiply the probabilities of each event:
\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is:
\[ 12\% \]"
"First, let's find out how many seashells Carlos collected. Since Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected, we can find the number of seashells Carlos collected by subtracting 5 from 27.

Carlos's seashells = 27 - 5 = 22

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. So, we can find the number of seashells Carrey collected by dividing the number of seashells Carlos collected by 2.

Carrey's seashells = 22 / 2 = 11

Now, let's add up all the seashells they collected.

Total seashells = Jim's seashells + Carlos's seashells + Carrey's seashells
Total seashells = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60

They divided all the seashells equally among themselves. So, we divide the total number of seashells by 3.

Seashells each person gets = Total seashells / 3
Seashells each person gets = 60 / 3 = 20

Each person gets 20 seashells."
"Mason eats 4 carrots each day on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays, so he eats 4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots.

"To satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required.

First, let's find out how many bottles are needed to cover 100% of the daily energy demand for one person. Since each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles to cover 100% (100% / 20% = 5 bottles).

Now, for 2300 people, the total number of bottles required would be:
2300 people * 5 bottles/person = 11500 bottles

Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles are needed, we subtract the current production from the total required:
11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 bottles

Hortex would have to produce 7300 more bottles of juices to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people."
"First, let's determine the number of octuplets dressed in each color. Since Carla has 8 identical octuplets:

- 3/4 of them are dressed in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \) octuplets.
- 1/4 of them are dressed in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \) octuplets.

Next, we need to find out how many of the blue-wearers and purple-wearers also wear bows:

- All 2 blue-wearers wear bows.
- 1/3 of the 6 purple-wearers wear bows: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) octuplets.

So, the total number of octuplets wearing bows is \( 2 + 2 = 4 \).

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. Out of the 4 bow-wearers, 2 are wearing purple. Therefore, the probability is:

\[ \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \]

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 50%."

"Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.

First, he sells half of the land:
- Half of 80 square meters is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.
- He sells this 40 square meters for $50.

Next, he sells another 1/4 of his original land:
- 1/4 of 80 square meters is \( \frac{80}{4} = 20 \) square meters.
- He sells this 20 square meters for $30.

Now, we need to find out how much land is left:
- He originally had 80 square meters.
- He sold 40 square meters and 20 square meters.
- So, the remaining land is \( 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 \) square meters.

He sells the remaining 20 square meters at $3 per square meter:
- The money from selling the remaining land is \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) dollars.

"First, let's calculate the number of apartments in the third complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have \(200 + 200 = 400\) apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than this, so it has \(400 + (0.60 \times 400) = 400 + 240 = 640\) apartments.

Next, we calculate the total number of apartments John collects from all three complexes. This is \(200 + 200 + 640 = 1040\) apartments.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, so the total number of collections per week is \(1040 \times 3 = 3120\).

"To find the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, let's break down the production year by year.

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Let's denote the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces as \(x\). Therefore, the 8-year-old tree produces \(x - 200\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Since the 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than the 10-year-old tree, we can set up the equation:
\[x - 200 = \text{fruits produced by 8-year-old tree}\]
But we know the 8-year-old tree produces \(x - 200\) fruits, and we also know the 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits. So:
\[x - 200 = \text{fruits produced by 8-year-old tree}\]
Since the 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits, we can substitute \(x\) with 1000:
\[1000 - 200 = 800\]
So, the 8-year-old tree produces 800 fruits.

Now, let's sum up the fruits produced each year:
- 5-year-old: 50 fruits
- 6-year-old: 150 fruits
- 7-year-old: 350 fruits
- 8-year-old: 800 fruits
- 9-year-old: 0 fruits
- 10-year-old: 1000 fruits

Adding these together:
\[50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2550\]

So, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:

- Let \( R \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes was 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we can substitute \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation. From \( B = Y - 7 \), we can substitute \( B \) in the equation \( R = 4B \) to get \( R = 4(Y - 7) \).

Now, substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Add 35 to both sides:
\[ 6Y = 72 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now, we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters.

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters."
"First, let's determine how much money Rissa was given. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars. According to the problem, after giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, Rissa gave $3 to her little sister. Since Ronnie also gave an equal amount of money to his little sister, he also gave $3. Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's possession is:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"The mural is divided into four colors: red, white, purple, and yellow. We know that half of the mural is yellow, which means the yellow paint takes up 6 pints (since 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints).

The remaining paint is equally divided among red, white, and purple. Since the total amount of paint is 12 pints and 6 pints are yellow, the remaining paint is 12 pints - 6 pints = 6 pints.

These 6 pints are equally divided among red, white, and purple. So, each of these colors uses 6 pints / 3 = 2 pints.

Therefore, the mural used 2 pints of red paint.

2 pints"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:

\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the total area of the house is:

\[ 3160 \text{ square feet} \]"
"On Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.

On Tuesday, she sees double the number of clouds from Monday, so she counts \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs of clouds.

On Wednesday, she sees double the number of clouds from Tuesday, so she counts \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs of clouds.

On Thursday, she sees double the number of clouds from Wednesday, so she counts \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs of clouds.

On Friday, she sees double the number of clouds from Thursday, so she counts \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs of clouds.

To find the total number of clouds she counted across all five days, we add the number of clouds from each day:

\(3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93\)

At the end of the week, Alice will have counted 93 puffs of clouds in the sky at lunch across all five days."
"First, let's find out how many pods are in the special size box. The regular box has 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods.

To find 20% of 100:
\[ 100 \times 0.20 = 20 \]

So, the special size box has:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. To find the cost per pod in the special size box:
\[ \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

If you have $1, you can buy:
\[ \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \text{ pods} \]

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run:
\[ 10 \text{ dishwashing cycles} \]

Final numerical answer:
10"
"Thomas initially withdraws $1000 in $20 bills. To find out how many $20 bills he gets, we divide $1000 by $20:

\[ \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \]

So, Thomas has 50 $20 bills.

He loses 10 bills while getting home, so he has:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

He then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, he uses 20 $20 bills to pay for a bill, leaving him with:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Thomas then triples his money. The value of the remaining $20 bills is:

\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \]

Tripling this amount gives:

\[ 400 \times 3 = 1200 \]

Finally, he converts all his money to $5 bills. The number of $5 bills he gets is:

\[ \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 240 \]"
"In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. So, team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals.

Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half. So, team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.

Now, let's add up all the goals:

First half: Team A = 4 goals, Team B = 2 goals
Second half: Team A = 2 goals, Team B = 8 goals

Total goals scored in the match = 4 + 2 + 2 + 8 = 16 goals.

"The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk and used 45% of it on Monday. To find out how much chalk he used, we calculate 45% of 5 inches:

\[ 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \text{ inches} \]

So, after Monday, the teacher has:

\[ 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]

The teacher plans to use only 20% of the chalk each day. To find out how much chalk he uses each day, we calculate 20% of 2.75 inches:

\[ 2.75 \times 0.20 = 0.55 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to determine how many days he can use 0.55 inches of chalk before it becomes smaller than 2 inches. We start with 2.75 inches and subtract 0.55 inches each day until the chalk is less than 2 inches.

Day 1: \( 2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20 \) inches
Day 2: \( 2.20 - 0.55 = 1.65 \) inches

On the second day, the chalk is 1.65 inches, which is less than 2 inches. Therefore, the teacher has to recycle the chalk after 2 days.

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of girls on varsity. One-third of the 12 girls are on varsity, so:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

This means 4 girls are on varsity.

Next, let's calculate the number of boys on varsity. One-fourth of the 12 boys are on varsity, so:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \]

This means 3 boys are on varsity.

Now, let's find out how many students are not on varsity. We start with the total number of students, which is 24 (12 boys + 12 girls), and subtract the number of students on varsity:

\[ 24 - (4 + 3) = 24 - 7 = 17 \]

So, the number of students not on varsity is 17."
"Mike bought 5 face masks.

Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. So, we calculate thrice the number of masks Mike bought first:

Thrice the number of masks Mike bought = 3 * 5 = 15

Now, add 2 to that number:

Johnny's masks = 15 + 2 = 17

Johnny bought 17 face masks."
"The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more than that, which means the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

In total, the dentist fixes 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

James has 30 teeth in total. To find the percentage of teeth the dentist fixes, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of fixed teeth}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

So,

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

The dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth."
"First, we need to calculate the total amount of milk that passed the expiry date. Mr. Marcellus purchased 4000 gallons of milk, and 2/5 of this amount was sour.

To find 2/5 of 4000 gallons:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate the refund amount. The company sold the milk at $3.5 per gallon. Therefore, the refund for 1600 gallons is:
\[ 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = 1600 \times 3.5 = 5600 \]

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of:
\[ \$5600 \]

"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 5(C + 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7) \]

Next, we'll eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, we'll isolate \( C \) by moving terms involving \( C \) to one side and constants to the other:
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

Final answer:

"First, let's find out how many books Bob can buy with $27000. We know that 100 books cost $500. 

To find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of 100 books:
\[ \frac{27000}{500} = 54 \]

This means Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books with $27000. So, the total number of books he can buy is:
\[ 54 \times 100 = 5400 \]

Now, since the $27000 is distributed between 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books each school can get:
\[ \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \]

So, Bob can buy 1800 books per school.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Two apples fell out of the tree, and one landed on Newton's head. Newton picked up the two apples.
   - Apples picked up: 2

2. Newton put one apple in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out of the tree.
   - Apples thrown into the tree: 1
   - Apples that fell: 5
   - Apples picked up: 5

3. Newton picked up these 5 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree, causing another 6 apples to fall out of the tree.
   - Apples thrown into the tree: 1
   - Apples that fell: 6
   - Apples picked up: 6

4. Newton picked up all of the remaining apples and went home to make a pie.
   - Apples in his pocket: 1 (from step 2) + 1 (from step 3) = 2
   - Apples picked up: 2 (from step 1) + 5 (from step 2) + 6 (from step 3) = 13
   - Total apples: 2 (in pocket) + 13 (picked up) = 15

So, the total number of apples Newton brought home is 15."
"To find out the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of 50 kg bags needed.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of bags and the cost per bag.

First, we calculate the number of 50 kg bags needed:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total weight of coal}}{\text{Weight per bag}} = \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Cost per bag} = 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of Ali's order is:

"First, let's calculate how many slices of each type of pizza Kate's friends will eat in total.

Each friend eats 6 slices of cheese pizza and 4 slices of pepperoni pizza. Since there are 6 friends, we multiply the number of slices each friend eats by the number of friends:

- Cheese pizza slices: \(6 \text{ slices/friend} \times 6 \text{ friends} = 36 \text{ slices}\)
- Pepperoni pizza slices: \(4 \text{ slices/friend} \times 6 \text{ friends} = 24 \text{ slices}\)

Next, we need to determine how many whole cheese and pepperoni pizzas are required to provide these slices.

- For cheese pizza, each pizza is cut into 12 slices. So, the number of cheese pizzas needed is \( \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas}\).
- For pepperoni pizza, each pizza is cut into 8 slices. So, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is \( \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas}\).

Adding the number of cheese and pepperoni pizzas together, we get:

- Total pizzas: \(3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas}\).

So, Kate needs to buy 6 pizza pies."
"Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, which is 3 days. So, the total miles for these days are:
3 miles/day * 3 days = 9 miles

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day, which is 2 days. So, the total miles for these days are:
5 miles/day * 2 days = 10 miles

Adding the miles from both sets of days gives:
9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles

So, Sam ran 19 miles this week."
"First, let's figure out how many snowballs Jay actually gains in an hour. 

Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 fifteen-minute intervals in an hour, the number of snowballs that melt in an hour is:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

So, the net gain of snowballs in an hour is:
\[ 20 - 8 = 12 \]

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. Since he gains 12 snowballs per hour, we can set up the following equation to find the number of hours (\( h \)) it will take to have 60 snowballs:
\[ 12h = 60 \]

Solving for \( h \):
\[ h = \frac{60}{12} = 5 \]

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Jim's age when Digimon came out and then find out how old he is now.

1. First, we need to find out how many years ago Digimon came out. Since John is 28 now and he was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out, we can set up the following relationship:

Let \( J \) be Jim's age when Digimon came out, and \( 2J \) be John's age when Digimon came out. Since John is 28 now, the number of years since Digimon came out is \( 28 - 2J \).

2. According to the problem, John was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out, so we can write the equation:
\[ 2J = 28 - (28 - 2J) \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 2J = 28 - 28 + 2J \]
\[ 2J = 2J \]
This equation is true but doesn't give us a specific value for \( J \). Instead, we can use the relationship directly. If John is 28 now and he was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out, we can set up the equation:
\[ 28 - (28 - 2J) = 2J \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 28 - 28 + 2J = 2J \]
\[ 2J = 2J \]
This is still not giving us a specific value, so we need to use the relationship directly. If John is 28 now and he was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out, we can say:
\[ 28 - (28 - 2J) = 2J \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 28 - 14 = 14 - J \]
\[ 14 = 14 - J \]
\[ J = 14 \]
So, Jim was 14 when Digimon came out. Since John is 28 now, the number of years since Digimon came out is:
\[ 28 - 14 = 14 \]
So, Jim is now:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - The nurses used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the first day, they had \(50 - 38 = 12\) bandages left.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - Adding the 12 bandages left from the first day, they had \(12 + 50 = 62\) bandages before using 28 on the second day.
   - So, at the end of the second day, they had \(62 - 28 = 34\) bandages left.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they added \(50 \times 2 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages.
   - Adding the 100 bandages and subtracting the 25 bandages used, they had \(34 + 100 - 25 = 109\) bandages before the end of the third day.
   - They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so they must have started with \(109 - 78 = 31\) bandages at the beginning of the third day.

Since they had 34 bandages at the end of the second day, and they started with 31 bandages at the beginning of the third day, they must have had \(34 - 31 = 3\) bandages left over from the second day. This means they started with \(31 - 3 = 28\) bandages at the end of the first day.

So, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is \(\boxed{28}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut. The cost per inch of haircut is $30. May's hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, which means her hair was cut by 2 inches.

The cost for the haircut is:
\[ 2 \text{ inches} \times \$30 \text{ per inch} = \$60 \]

Next, we add the cost of the color, which is $40.

The total cost is:
\[ \$60 + \$40 = \$100 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$100 \]"
"Jen works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week. In April, which has exactly 4 weeks, she works:

\[ 7.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 6 \, \text{days/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 180 \, \text{hours} \]

At an hourly rate of $1.5, her earnings from working hours are:

\[ 180 \, \text{hours} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$270 \]

Since Jen did not incur any absences, she receives the additional $10 for complete attendance. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:

**Final Answer: 280**"
"Let's calculate the money Jason earned for each task over the two-week period:

1. For emptying the dishwasher: $0.50 per time, and he did it 6 times.
   So, $0.50 * 6 = $3.00

2. For doing his laundry: $3.00 per time, and he did it once.
   So, $3.00 * 1 = $3.00

3. For taking the trash to the curb: $0.75 per time, and he did it twice.
   So, $0.75 * 2 = $1.50

4. For cleaning his room: $1.50 per time, and he did it once.
   So, $1.50 * 1 = $1.50

Now, let's add up all the money he earned:
$3.00 (dishwasher) + $3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (trash) + $1.50 (cleaning room) = $9.00

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Each whale has 40 gallons of blood. A shark has three times as much blood as a whale, so a shark has:

\[ 40 \text{ gallons} \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

If we have ten sharks, the total amount of blood for ten sharks is:

\[ 120 \text{ gallons/shark} \times 10 \text{ sharks} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

The number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is 1200 gallons."
"In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
At 10:00, 40 more people entered.
Twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in later, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people.
By evening, 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered, which is 3 * 50 = 150 people.

Now, let's add all these numbers together to find the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day:

50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) + 80 (later) + 150 (evening) = 320

The total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is:
5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens

She bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. So, the number of black pens is:
2 * 25 red pens = 50 black pens

To find the total number of pens, we add the red and black pens together:
25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens

Alain has 75 pens."
"First, let's find the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles for $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Next, John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, which means he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The cost of cognac per bottle is 50% more than the cost of scotch. So, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ 60 + (0.5 \times 60) = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 20 bottles of cognac:

\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount spent:

\[ 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount John spends on everything is:

\[ 2400 \]"
"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, which means he planted 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so he planted 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he did on the first day, which means he planted 40 + (1/4 * 40) = 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days:

- Total White Oak trees: 20 (first day) + 30 (second day) = 50 White Oak trees
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90 Lodgepole Pine trees

Adding these together, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 50 (White Oak) + 90 (Lodgepole Pine) = 140 trees.

"Fred initially made 24 gallons of root beer.

- On the first day, his children drank 4 gallons, so he had \(24 - 4 = 20\) gallons left.
- On the second day, his wife spilled 7 gallons, so he had \(20 - 7 = 13\) gallons left.
- On the third day, his friend Ronnie drank 5 gallons, so he had \(13 - 5 = 8\) gallons left.

On the fourth day, 3 people (including Fred) showed up for the party. The remaining 8 gallons were shared equally among the 3 people.

To find out how much each person got, we divide the remaining root beer by the number of people:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ gallons}}{3 \text{ people}} = \frac{8}{3} \text{ gallons per person} \]

So, each person got \(\frac{8}{3}\) gallons of root beer, which is approximately 2.67 gallons.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \frac{8}{3} \text{ gallons per person} \]"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Let's say the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \( x \).
2. According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation: \( 4x + 8 = 40 \).
3. To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation. First, subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: \( 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \). This simplifies to \( 4x = 32 \).
4. Next, divide both sides by 4: \( \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \). This simplifies to \( x = 8 \).

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \( 8 \).

"First, let's find out how many fish have red stripes. One-third of the 66 fish have red stripes:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after removing the fish with red stripes:

\[ 66 - 22 = 44 \]

Now, we need to find out how many of the remaining 44 fish have blue stripes. According to the problem, 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes:

\[ \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \]

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

To find the total number of fish that have either red stripes or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[ 22 + 20 = 42 \]

Therefore, the total number of fish that have red stripes and blue stripes is 42."
"Amy originally had:
- 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
- 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.

Her sister steals one of the palettes, so Amy loses 4 colors from the stolen palette. Now, Amy has:
- \(8 - 4 = 4\) colors from the remaining palette.
- \(18\) colors from the makeup sets.

Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, so she uses up:
- \(\frac{6}{2} = 3\) colors from one set.

Therefore, she has:
- \(18 - 3 = 15\) colors left from the makeup sets.

Adding the remaining colors from the palette and the makeup sets, Amy has:
- \(4 + 15 = 19\) eyeshadow colors left.

\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \]

shells for the other two teams to find.

Next, team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ 420 \times 0.60 = 252 \]

So, team The finders found 252 shells. This leaves:

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

First, let's calculate the total miles walked by the first three dogs:
- The first dog walks 1 mile.
- The second dog walks 4 miles.
- The third dog walks 3 miles.

Adding these up, we get:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \text{ miles} \]

Since the average miles walked per day by the four dogs is 3 miles, the total miles walked by all four dogs per day is:
\[ 4 \text{ dogs} \times 3 \text{ miles/dog} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day.

Next, we determine how much of the loan John uses to pay off his debts. He uses 60% of the loan amount:
\[ 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Now, we find out how much money John has leftover after paying off his debts. Since he used $60,000 of the $100,000 loan, the leftover amount is:
\[ 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the amount of money John had leftover after paying off his debts is:

"To find out how much Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught. 

The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms, the second tuna weighs 46 kilograms, and the last tuna weighs 26 kilograms. 

Adding these weights together:
56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms

Now, if a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the total weight by the price per kilogram:
128 kilograms * $0.50 per kilogram = $64

So, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market."

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, subtract the buying price from the selling price:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

So, her profit is $27."
"First, let's calculate the amount of water removed by the dehumidifier on each setting:

- Low setting: 1 liter per day
- Medium setting: twice as much as the low setting, so 2 liters per day
- High setting: twice as much as the medium setting, so 4 liters per day

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water removed on each setting:

- Low setting for 3 days: 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters
- Medium setting for 3 days: 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters
- High setting for 5 days: 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters

Finally, let's add up the total amount of water removed:

3 liters (low) + 6 liters (medium) + 20 liters (high) = 29 liters

The total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."

For one dose:
- Saanvi uses 14 mL of the first medicine.
- She uses 3 times that amount of the second medicine, which is 3 * 14 mL = 42 mL.

So, for one dose, the total amount of medicine used is:
14 mL (first medicine) + 42 mL (second medicine) = 56 mL.

Now, to find out how much medicine is used in 8 doses, we multiply the amount used in one dose by 8:

"First, let's calculate the volume of the jar. The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall. The volume \( V \) of the jar is given by:

\[ V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans, considering the packing efficiency. The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume \( V_{\text{eff}} \) is:

\[ V_{\text{eff}} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches. Therefore, the maximum number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is:

\[ \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \]

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the estimated number of red jelly beans is:

\[ \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between the true number and the estimated number is:

"The bus started with 20 people on board. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the number of people on the bus after the first stop is:

20 (initial) + 40 (entered) = 60 people

At the second station, 3/4 of the 40 people who entered at the first station entered again. So, the number of people entering at the second station is:

3/4 * 40 = 30 people

After the second stop, the number of people on the bus is:

60 (after first stop) + 30 (entered at second stop) = 90 people

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the number of people on the bus after the third stop is:

90 * 2 = 180 people

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find out how many more people are needed to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the current number of people on the bus from the bus's capacity:

200 (capacity) - 180 (current number of people) = 20 people

So, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is:

"Pauline visits the museum three times a year. Initially, the cost of one visit is $2. 

First, let's calculate the cost of one visit after 5 years. The cost increased by 150%, so the new cost is the original cost plus 150% of the original cost:
\[ \text{New cost} = 2 + (1.5 \times 2) = 2 + 3 = 5 \]

Pauline visits the museum three times a year, so in 5 years, she made:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we calculate:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"First, we need to determine how many pounds of ground beef Aiden will need to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can calculate the pounds of ground beef needed as follows:

\[ \text{Pounds of ground beef} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much of his secret steakhouse seasoning he will need for 5 pounds of ground beef. Since he adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef, we can calculate the total amount of seasoning as follows:

\[ \text{Seasoning needed} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

So, Aiden will need \(\boxed{10}\) tablespoons of his secret seasoning."
"First, we need to find the total width of the windows. Since there are five windows and each window is 35 inches wide, we can calculate the total width as follows:

\[ 5 \text{ windows} \times 35 \text{ inches per window} = 175 \text{ inches} \]

Next, Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. So, we multiply the total width by 2:

\[ 175 \text{ inches} \times 2 = 350 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute. So, the cost for the first 16 minutes is:
16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

For the remaining 20 minutes (since the total call is 36 minutes), the cost is $0.20 per minute. So, the cost for the remaining 20 minutes is:
20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00

Adding both parts together, the total cost for a 36-minute call is:
$4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

$8.00"
"Twice of Monday's total rain is 2 inches * 2 = 4 inches.
So, on Tuesday, it is expected to rain 1 more inch than 4 inches, which is 4 inches + 1 inch = 5 inches.

The final numerical answer is 5 inches."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the number of cupcakes be \( c \).
2. According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. So, the number of brownies is \( 3c - 2 \).
3. Each person in the class gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. Therefore, the total number of treats is \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \).
4. The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and the number of brownies. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   c + (3c - 2) = 10
   \]
5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   c + 3c - 2 = 10
   \]
   \[
   4c - 2 = 10
   \]
6. Add 2 to both sides of the equation:
   \[
   4c = 12
   \]
7. Divide both sides by 4:
   \[
   c = 3
   \]

So, Carly made \(\boxed{3}\) cupcakes."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the discount.

The cost of a basic manicure is $35, and the cost of a basic pedicure is $40. The salon offers a 20% discount on both services if you get both.

The discount amount for the manicure is:
\[ 35 \times 0.20 = 7 \]
So, the discounted price for the manicure is:
\[ 35 - 7 = 28 \]

The discount amount for the pedicure is:
\[ 40 \times 0.20 = 8 \]
So, the discounted price for the pedicure is:
\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the nail art. Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, which means 10 nails on each hand (since there are 10 fingers in total).

The cost of nail art for one hand is:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]
So, the cost of nail art for both hands is:
\[ 30 \times 2 = 60 \]

Now, we add the discounted prices of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art:
\[ 28 + 32 + 60 = 120 \]

So, the total amount Karen would pay is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of issues Susan gets from each magazine type:

1. For the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year each:
   \(3 \times 12 = 36\) issues

2. For the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
   \(6\) issues

3. For the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
   \(4 \times 6 = 24\) issues

Now, let's add up all the issues she gets from these magazines:
\(36 + 6 + 24 = 66\) issues

So, Susan gets 66 issues every year. However, the question asks for the number of magazines she gets every year, not the number of issues. Since the number of issues per magazine is not the same, we need to count the magazines:

- 3 magazines that send 12 issues each
- 1 magazine that sends 6 issues
- 1 magazine that sends 24 issues

So, the total number of magazines is:
\(3 + 1 + 1 = 5\)

Final numerical answer:
5"
"Samantha has 27 paintings.

Since Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, we can find out how many paintings Shelley has by adding 12 to Samantha's number of paintings:
27 (Samantha's paintings) + 12 = 39 paintings for Shelley.

Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, so to find out how many paintings Kim has, we subtract 8 from Shelley's number of paintings:
39 (Shelley's paintings) - 8 = 31 paintings for Kim.

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings."
"In November, the toy was $40.

In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]
So, the price in December is:
\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]

In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price:
\[ 72 \times 0.50 = 36 \]
So, the price in January is:
\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \]

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"First, let's calculate the amount Charlie makes from the 4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour.

For the 4 lessons at $80 each:
\[ 4 \times 80 = 320 \]

Next, we need to calculate the reduced rate for the lessons with the veteran. The standard rate is $80, and it is reduced by 25%. To find the reduced rate, we calculate 25% of $80 and subtract it from the standard rate.

25% of $80 is:
\[ 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \]

So, the reduced rate is:
\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Now, we calculate the amount Charlie makes from the 2 1-hour lessons with the veteran at the reduced rate of $60 each.

For the 2 lessons at $60 each:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Finally, we add the amounts from both types of lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make for the day.

Total amount:
\[ 320 + 120 = 440 \]

So, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is:
\[ 440 \]"
"To find Sally's mean score, we need to add up all her scores and then divide by the number of quizzes.

First, let's add up all the scores:
50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630

Next, we count the number of quizzes, which is 9.

Now, we divide the total sum by the number of quizzes:
630 / 9 = 70

So, Sally's mean score is 70."
"Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had.

First, calculate 1/4 of 20:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]

So, Eve is left with 5 pomelos. To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Eve gave away 15 pomelos."
"First, let's find out how many apples Walter ate. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 apples.

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, let's find out how many apples are left after he ate 24 of them.

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. To find out how many apples that is, we calculate 25% of 36.

\[ 0.25 \times 36 = 9 \]

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. Now, let's find out how many apples are left after he gave 9 to his sister.

\[ 36 - 9 = 27 \]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple.

\[ 27 \times 3 = 81 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 81 \]"
"To find out how many novels Regina has written this year, we can set up a simple equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of novels Regina has written this year as \( x \).

According to the problem, 9 novels are 3 quarters (or \(\frac{3}{4}\)) of the number of novels she has written this year. This can be written as:
\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4}x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \). We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):
\[ x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

Now, we perform the multiplication:
\[ x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 9 \times 1.3333 = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

"Michael travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr. If he travels for 3 days, we need to calculate the total distance he covers in those 3 days. However, the problem does not specify the number of hours he travels each day, so we will assume he travels for 24 hours each day (a full day).

Distance covered in one day = Speed × Time
Distance covered in one day = 50 km/hr × 24 hr = 1200 km

Distance covered in 3 days = 1200 km/day × 3 days = 3600 km

The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of this distance that Michael has covered, we use the formula:

Percentage of distance covered = (Distance covered / Total distance) × 100

Percentage of distance covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) × 100 = 0.6 × 100 = 60%

60%"
"First, let's calculate how many grapes Madeline's brother used to make the grape juice. Since he used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, and Madeline ate 6 grapes, we can calculate the number of grapes used by her brother as follows:

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \]

Next, we need to determine how many grapes were left after Madeline and her brother ate and used their grapes. Initially, the total number of grapes is unknown, but we know that after Madeline and her brother used their grapes, the remaining grapes were used to make 4 pies. Each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes, so the total number of grapes used for the pies is:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \]

Now, we can find the total number of grapes at the beginning by adding the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and the grapes used for the pies:

\[ 6 + 30 + 48 = 84 \]

So, the total number of grapes at the beginning was:

\[ 84 \]"
"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the number of substitute teachers.

Total number of teachers: 82
Number of sick teachers: 13
Number of substitute teachers: 9

Teachers at school = Total number of teachers - Number of sick teachers + Number of substitute teachers
Teachers at school = 82 - 13 + 9
Teachers at school = 69 + 9
Teachers at school = 78

So, the final number of teachers at school that day was 78."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the ingredients for one batch of macaroni and cheese:

- The cost of pasta is $1.00.
- The cost of cheddar cheese is $3.00.
- The cost of gruyere cheese is twice the cost of cheddar cheese, which is $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

Now, let's add up the costs for one batch:
$1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar cheese) + $6.00 (gruyere cheese) = $10.00.

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, we need to find out how much he spends in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:
$10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

So, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year."
"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes to clean one classroom, the total time needed is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many minutes the custodian works in a day. Since they work 8 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total working time in a day is:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to clean all the classrooms. Since the custodian has 5 days to clean the school, we can calculate the total time available over 5 days:

\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 480 \text{ minutes/day} = 2400 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 1200 minutes are needed to clean all the classrooms and the custodian has 2400 minutes available over 5 days, we can see that the custodian has enough time to clean all the classrooms within the given timeframe.

To find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning classrooms, we use the total time spent cleaning (1200 minutes) and the total time available in a day (480 minutes):

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = \left( \frac{1200 \text{ minutes}}{480 \text{ minutes/day}} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = \left( \frac{1200}{480} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = 2.5 \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = 250\% \]

However, this result indicates the total time spent over the 5 days, not the average percentage of the day spent cleaning. To find the average percentage of the day spent cleaning, we need to consider the total time spent cleaning per day:

\[ \text{Time spent cleaning per day} = \frac{1200 \text{ minutes}}{5 \text{ days}} = 240 \text{ minutes/day} \]

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = \left( \frac{240 \text{ minutes/day}}{480 \text{ minutes/day}} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = \left( \frac{240}{480} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = 0.5 \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percentage of day spent cleaning} = 50\% \]

So, the custodian spends 50% of their day, on average, cleaning classrooms."
"First, let's figure out how many books each shelf can hold:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(10 \times 2 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total number of books that one bookcase can hold:

- One bookcase has 2 middle shelves, 1 bottom shelf, and 1 top shelf.
- So, the total capacity of one bookcase is \(2 \times 10 + 20 + 15 = 20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

- \(110 \div 55 = 2\).

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs, and the cost is $2.40 per dozen. So, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's determine how many eggs Rose has in total. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many sets of 3 eggs Rose can sell from 60 eggs. This is calculated as:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets of 3 eggs} \]

Since Rose sells each set of 3 eggs for $1, her total revenue from selling all the eggs is:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Rose's profit is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Skyler has 100 hats in total.

First, we calculate the number of red hats:
- Half of the hats are red, so \( \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \) red hats.

Next, we find out how many hats are left after removing the red hats:
- \( 100 - 50 = 50 \) hats are left.

Then, we calculate the number of blue hats:
- \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining 50 hats are blue, so \( \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \) blue hats.

Finally, we determine the number of white hats:
- The rest of the hats are white, so \( 50 - 30 = 20 \) white hats.

Therefore, Skyler has 20 white hats."
"Archie buys beef jerky that costs $18.00 per bag but gets a $3.00 discount, so the bag costs $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

The bag contains 30 sticks of jerky. To find the cost per stick, we divide the total cost of the bag by the number of sticks:

$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50 per stick.

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.50 to cents:

$0.50 = 50 cents.

Each stick of jerky will cost 50 cents."
"First, let's calculate the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass. She needs to get 70% of the total questions correct. The total number of questions is the sum of the questions from both tests, which is 70 + 40 = 110 questions.

To find out how many questions she needs to get right, we calculate 70% of 110:
\[ 0.70 \times 110 = 77 \]

So, Audrey needs to get 77 questions correct in total to pass.

Next, we need to determine how many questions she got correct on the first test. She got 60% of the 70 questions correct:
\[ 0.60 \times 70 = 42 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more questions she needs to get correct on the second test to reach the total of 77 correct answers. We subtract the number of correct answers from the first test from the total number of correct answers needed:
\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 35 \]"
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. So, we can write:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116. Therefore, we can write:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Now, substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Add 4 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know \( S = 20 \), we can find \( B \) using the first equation:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is:
\[ \boxed{96} \]"

"To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can break down the problem into smaller steps based on the given ratios.

1. **Determine the number of customers needed to sell 15 cars:**
   - For every 2 customers, 1 car is sold.
   - Therefore, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs \(15 \times 2 = 30\) customers.

2. **Determine the number of telephone calls needed to get 30 customers:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes into the dealership.
   - Therefore, to get 30 customers, Jason needs \(30 \times 25 = 750\) telephone calls.

So, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"Brianna's family has 4 people, so they have 4 flashlights. There are 8 rooms in the house, so they have 2 flashlights for each room, which means they have 8 rooms * 2 flashlights/room = 16 flashlights in total. Since there are 4 people, they will use 4 of these 16 flashlights, leaving 16 - 4 = 12 flashlights for the rooms.

For the candles, half of the 8 rooms have 4 small candles each, so that's 8 rooms / 2 = 4 rooms with small candles. This means they have 4 rooms * 4 small candles/room = 16 small candles. The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each, so that's also 4 rooms * 5 medium candles/room = 20 medium candles.

Adding the small and medium candles together, they have 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

So, when the lights go out, Brianna's family is using 4 flashlights and 36 candles.

Final numerical answer:
4 flashlights and 36 candles."
"Mitchell buys two bags of chips, with each bag containing 55 chips. So, the total number of chips is:

2 bags * 55 chips/bag = 110 chips

"John takes 5 minutes for the first side. 

For the second and third sides, it takes twice as long as the first side, so:
- Second side: 5 minutes * 2 = 10 minutes
- Third side: 5 minutes * 2 = 10 minutes

For the last 2 sides, it takes half as long as the first side, so:
- Fourth side: 5 minutes / 2 = 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 5 minutes / 2 = 2.5 minutes

The sixth side is the last side, and once you get the fifth side, you have all 6 sides. So, the sixth side is also:
- Sixth side: 5 minutes / 2 = 2.5 minutes

Now, we add up all the times:

"First, let's calculate how many minutes Tim spends at work each day answering phones. Since he spends 6 hours each day at work and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total minutes as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many calls he can handle in one day. Since it takes him 15 minutes to deal with each call, we divide the total minutes he spends at work each day by the time it takes to handle one call:

\[ 360 \text{ minutes/day} \div 15 \text{ minutes/call} = 24 \text{ calls/day} \]

Now, to find out how many calls he deals with during his 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls he handles each day by the number of workdays in a week:

\[ 24 \text{ calls/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 120 \text{ calls/week} \]

"First, we calculate the drying time for one painting with the old varnish, which is 7 minutes.

For 6 paintings, the total drying time with the old varnish would be:
\[ 7 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 42 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the drying time for one painting with the new varnish, which is 12 minutes.

For 6 paintings, the total drying time with the new varnish would be:
\[ 12 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 72 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out how much longer it will take with the new varnish, we subtract the total drying time with the old varnish from the total drying time with the new varnish:
\[ 72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish."

4 plants * 0.5 cup/plant = 2 cups

For the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water each:
8 plants * 1 cup/plant = 8 cups

Now, we know Crista has 20 plants in total. So, the remaining plants are:
20 plants - 4 plants - 8 plants = 8 plants

These 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water each:
8 plants * 0.25 cup/plant = 2 cups

- Speed on land = 20 yards per minute
- Distance on land = 100 yards
- Time on land = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to swim in water:
- Speed in water = 10 yards per minute
- Distance in water = 100 yards
- Time in water = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Finally, we add the time spent on land and in water to find the total time:
- Total time = Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

Therefore, it will take Phineas Frog 15 minutes to return home."
"Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks for his project. Popsicles come 8 to a box. To find out how many boxes he needs, we divide the total number of sticks by the number of sticks per box:

56 sticks ÷ 8 sticks/box = 7 boxes

Each box costs $2.00. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

7 boxes × $2.00/box = $14.00

So, it will cost Bob $14.00 to build his project."
"The main phone plan costs $20, and it costs twice as much as each additional phone.

So, each additional phone costs $20 / 2 = $10.

There are four additional phones, so the cost for the additional phones is 4 * $10 = $40.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones.

So, the total cost is $20 + $40 = $60.

The whole phone plan costs $60."
"First, let's calculate the total number of doughnuts Derrick makes every day. Since he makes 10 dozen doughnuts daily, and one dozen equals 12 doughnuts, he makes:

\[ 10 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ doughnuts/dozen} = 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many doughnuts he makes in June. June typically has 30 days, so the total number of doughnuts made in June is:

\[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

Derrick sells each doughnut for $2, so the total money he makes in June is:

\[ 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \times 2 \text{ dollars/doughnut} = 7200 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Derrick makes $7200 in June if he sells all the doughnuts."
"Jade takes 7 photos in one batch and uploads 6 batches each day. So, the number of photos she uploads each day is:

7 photos/batch * 6 batches/day = 42 photos/day

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take her to upload all 210 photos. We do this by dividing the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads each day:

210 photos / 42 photos/day = 5 days

So, Jade will need 5 days to upload all of her photos."
"First, let's calculate the cost for each type of clothing per week:

- Blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00 per blouse = $25.00
- Pants: 2 pairs of pants * $8.00 per pair = $16.00
- Skirts: 1 skirt * $6.00 per skirt = $6.00

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost per week:
$25.00 (blouses) + $16.00 (pants) + $6.00 (skirts) = $47.00

To find the total cost for 5 weeks, we multiply the weekly cost by 5:
$47.00 * 5 = $235.00

So, Alicia spends $235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed after training. His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so:

\[ 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of words John needs to speak. Each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages, so:

\[ 450 \, \text{words/page} \times 10 \, \text{pages} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we need to calculate how long it will take him to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. The time required is given by:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speed."
"On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day, so:
50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so:
2 * 70 = 140 people.

For the rest of the week (days 4, 5, 6, and 7), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Since there are 4 days, the total number of people he saw on these days is:
4 * 60 = 240 people.

Now, to find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we add the number of people from each day:
50 (first day) + 70 (second day) + 140 (third day) + 240 (rest of the week) = 500 people.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 500."
"Let's break down the popping process step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds**: 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate triples, so \(20 \times 3 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate quadruples, so \(20 \times 4 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds**: The popping rate is halved from the previous 30 seconds, so \(80 \div 2 = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, let's add up the number of kernels that popped in the first four 30-second intervals:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\]

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop. So, a quarter of 40 kernels pop:
\[40 \div 4 = 10\]

Adding these to the total number of popped kernels:
\[200 + 10 = 210\]

So, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:
\[
\boxed{210}
\]"
"To make 4 gallons of lemonade, Tim needs 4 gallons * 1 cup of lemon juice per gallon = 4 cups of lemon juice.

For the extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart, he will need 2 * 1 cup of lemon juice = 2 cups of lemon juice.

In total, Tim needs 4 cups + 2 cups = 6 cups of lemon juice.

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, for 6 cups of juice, Tim will need 6 lemons * 6 = 36 lemons.

Therefore, Tim will need 36 lemons."
"To find out how much dog food the Kennel house will need in a week, we first need to calculate the daily consumption for each type of dog and then multiply by 7 days.

1. **German Shepherds:**
   - Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day.
   - There are 3 German Shepherds.
   - Daily consumption for German Shepherds: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) kilograms.

2. **Bulldogs:**
   - Each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.
   - There are 2 Bulldogs.
   - Daily consumption for Bulldogs: \(2 \times 3 = 6\) kilograms.

3. **Total daily consumption:**
   - Total daily consumption: \(15 + 6 = 21\) kilograms.

4. **Weekly consumption:**
   - Weekly consumption: \(21 \times 7 = 147\) kilograms.

So, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we need to calculate the total number of legs and then divide by 2 since a pair consists of 2 legs.

First, let's calculate the total number of legs from the 2-legged animals:
- There are 10 animals, each with 2 legs.
- So, \(10 \times 2 = 20\) legs.

Next, let's calculate the total number of legs from the 4-legged animals:
- There are 15 animals, each with 4 legs.
- So, \(15 \times 4 = 60\) legs.

Now, we add the legs from both types of animals to get the total number of legs:
- \(20 + 60 = 80\) legs.

Since a pair consists of 2 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2 to find the number of pairs:
- \(80 \div 2 = 40\) pairs.

So, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 40."
"The tower is made out of 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks. So, the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8.

Let's denote the number of red blocks as R.

The total number of blocks in the tower is the sum of blue, yellow, and red blocks, which is 32.

So, we have:
4 (blue) + 8 (yellow) + R (red) = 32

Now, we can solve for R:
4 + 8 + R = 32
12 + R = 32
R = 32 - 12
R = 20

Therefore, there are 20 red blocks in the tower.

20"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Elvis traveled in each direction and then determine his final distance from his house.

1. **Westward Travel:**
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 18 mph
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ mph} = 90 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Eastward Travel:**
   - Time: 8 hours
   - Speed: 18 mph
   - Distance: \( 8 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ mph} = 144 \text{ miles} \)

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we can find the net distance from his house by subtracting the westward distance from the eastward distance.

3. **Net Distance:**
   - Net Distance: \( 144 \text{ miles} - 90 \text{ miles} = 54 \text{ miles} \)

So, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now."
"To find the boat's value after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - Initial value: $9000
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700 \)
   - Value after first year: \( 9000 - 2700 = 6300 \)

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the second year: $6300
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890 \)
   - Value after second year: \( 6300 - 1890 = 4410 \)

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the third year: $4410
   - Depreciation rate: 20%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 4410 \times 0.20 = 882 \)
   - Value after third year: \( 4410 - 882 = 3528 \)

The boat is worth $3528 after three years."
"To find out how many pink candies there are, we first need to determine the number of each type of candy in the bag.

1. **Red Candies**: There are 54 red candies.
2. **Orange Candies**: There are twice as many orange candies as red candies. So, the number of orange candies is \(2 \times 54 = 108\).
3. **Yellow Candies**: There are half as many yellow candies as red candies. So, the number of yellow candies is \(\frac{54}{2} = 27\).

Now, we add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies:
\[54 + 108 + 27 = 189\]

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
\[232 - 189 = 43\]

So, the number of pink candies is \(\boxed{43}\)."
"To find out how much Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus trips separately, and then add them together.

1. **Hotel Cost:**
   - Helen booked a hotel for 3 nights.
   - The cost for one night at the hotel is $80.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the hotel is \(3 \times 80 = 240\) dollars.

2. **Bus Travel Cost:**
   - Helen rode the bus 7 times.
   - Each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel.
   - The cost of one bus trip is \(80 \times 0.10 = 8\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the bus trips is \(7 \times 8 = 56\) dollars.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - The total cost for the hotel and bus travels is the sum of the hotel cost and the bus travel cost.
   - Total cost = Hotel cost + Bus travel cost = \(240 + 56 = 296\) dollars.

So, Helen paid a total of 296 dollars for the hotel and bus travels during her trip."
"Mazie originally had 52 marbles. Dallas ended up with 21 marbles after dropping 4. This means Dallas originally received \(21 + 4 = 25\) marbles from Mazie. Therefore, Darla received the remaining marbles, which is \(52 - 25 = 27\).

So, Mazie gave Darla 27 marbles."
"The cost for the adult tickets is $12 each, and there are 2 adults, so that's 2 * $12 = $24. The cost for the child ticket is $8, so that's $8. They buy 2 popcorns for $3 each, so that's 2 * $3 = $6. 

Adding all these together: $24 (adults) + $8 (child) + $6 (popcorns) = $38.

They pay a total of $38."
"First, we need to calculate the total weight of the car, luggage, and children. The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and each child weighs 75 pounds. Since there are two children, we add their weights together.

Total weight of the children = 75 pounds + 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Now, we add the weight of the car, luggage, and children together:

Total weight = 1200 pounds + 250 pounds + 150 pounds = 1600 pounds

The force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of the total weight, we multiply the total weight by 0.01 (which is the decimal form of 1%).

Force needed = 1600 pounds * 0.01 = 16 pounds

So, the force John needs to push the car is 16 pounds."
"To determine how many feet of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular backyard fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the fence:
- Length = 20 feet
- Width = 15 feet

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (20 + 15) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 35 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

So, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper.

The average of their ages is 48."
"To find the total number of good seashells, we first need to calculate the total number of seashells found by Tom, Nancy, and Benny. Then, we subtract the number of cracked seashells from this total.

1. Calculate the total number of seashells found:
   - Tom found 214 seashells.
   - Nancy found 432 seashells.
   - Benny found 86 seashells.
   - Total seashells = 214 + 432 + 86 = 732 seashells.

2. Subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total:
   - Number of cracked seashells = 67.
   - Good seashells = Total seashells - Cracked seashells = 732 - 67 = 665 seashells.

The final numerical answer is:

"Avery needs to buy 3 place settings for each of the 12 people. Each place setting includes a dinner plate, a salad plate, and a bowl.

First, let's calculate the cost of one place setting:
- Dinner plate: $6.00
- Salad plate: $4.00
- Bowl: $5.00

Total cost for one place setting = $6.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $15.00

Now, since she needs 12 place settings, we multiply the cost of one place setting by 12:
Total cost for 12 place settings = $15.00 * 12 = $180.00

So, Avery will spend $180.00 on place settings."
"Steve took 10 hours to complete the puzzle.

Half of Steve's time is 10 / 2 = 5 hours.

It took Anna 7 hours to finish the puzzle."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of feed each pig eats in a day. Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day, so:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Since Dexter has five pigs, the total amount of feed all the pigs eat in a day is:

\[ 8 \text{ pounds/day/pig} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Now, to find out how much feed they eat in a week, we multiply the daily feed consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. After a week, the amount of feed left is:

\[ 300 \text{ pounds} - 280 \text{ pounds} = 20 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the pounds of feed left after a week is:

"First, we need to calculate the total number of hot dogs needed for the party. John invited 20 people, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. So, the total number of hot dogs needed is:

20 guests * 2 hot dogs/guest = 40 hot dogs

Next, we need to determine how many more hot dogs John needs to buy. He already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. So, the number of additional hot dogs needed is:

40 hot dogs - 4 hot dogs = 36 hot dogs

Now, we need to find out how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs. So, the number of packs needed is:

36 hot dogs / 6 hot dogs/pack = 6 packs

Finally, we need to calculate the cost of the hot dogs. Each pack costs $2, so the total cost is:

6 packs * $2/pack = $12

Therefore, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs."
"First, let's calculate the total money Frances makes from selling cupcakes and cookies.

- Frances sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each:
  20 cupcakes * $2/cupcake = $40

- Frances sells 40 cookies at $1 each:
  40 cookies * $1/cookie = $40

So, the total money from selling cupcakes and cookies is:
  $40 (from cupcakes) + $40 (from cookies) = $80

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the five trays she buys:
- Each tray costs $4, and she buys 5 trays:
  5 trays * $4/tray = $20

Now, we subtract the total cost of the trays from the total money she made:
  $80 (total money) - $20 (cost of trays) = $60

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many square feet the quilt will be, we need to calculate the total square footage contributed by each size of t-shirt and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the square footage from the small t-shirts:
- Each small t-shirt is 3 square feet.
- Octavia uses 11 small t-shirts.
- So, the total square footage from small t-shirts is \(11 \times 3 = 33\) square feet.

Next, let's calculate the square footage from the medium t-shirts:
- Each medium t-shirt is 4 square feet.
- Octavia uses 8 medium t-shirts.
- So, the total square footage from medium t-shirts is \(8 \times 4 = 32\) square feet.

Then, let's calculate the square footage from the large t-shirts:
- Each large t-shirt is 6 square feet.
- Octavia uses 6 large t-shirts.
- So, the total square footage from large t-shirts is \(6 \times 6 = 36\) square feet.

Now, we add up all the square footage:
- Total square footage = square footage from small t-shirts + square footage from medium t-shirts + square footage from large t-shirts
- Total square footage = \(33 + 32 + 36 = 101\) square feet.

So, the quilt will be 101 square feet."
"A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen equals 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. So, we calculate 50% of 36, which is 36 * 0.50 = 18.

Adding this to the original 36 seeds, a large sunflower has 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

To find the total number of seeds in both sunflowers, we add the seeds from the small sunflower and the large sunflower together: 36 + 54 = 90.

So, there are 90 sunflower seeds altogether."
"Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns. Since George has 18 pens, Timothy has \(3 \times 18 = 54\) pens.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a ""buy one get one 50% off"" deal. The original price of each T-shirt is $8.

For the first T-shirt, the cost is $8.
For the second T-shirt, the cost is 50% of $8, which is $8 * 0.5 = $4.

So, the total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The shoes are 40% off the original price of $40.

The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is $40 * 0.4 = $16.

So, the cost of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

Finally, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends:

$12 (T-shirts) + $24 (shoes) = $36.

The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36."

   - 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound
   - Cost = 1.5 * $8 = $12

3. **Special Honey:**
   - 2 pounds at $10 per pound
   - Cost = 2 * $10 = $20

### Total Cost for One Jar
- Total cost = Cost of passion fruit + Cost of jackfruit + Cost of honey
- Total cost = $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

### Revenue from Selling One Jar
- Revenue per jar = $50

### Profit from Selling One Jar
- Profit per jar = Revenue - Cost
- Profit per jar = $50 - $44 = $6

### Profit from Selling 10 Jars
- Total profit = Profit per jar * Number of jars
- Total profit = $6 * 10 = $60

**Final Answer:**
$60"
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and then sum them up.

1. **Quarters**: Each quarter is worth $0.25. Justin has 32 quarters.
   \[
   32 \times 0.25 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth $0.10. Justin has 95 dimes.
   \[
   95 \times 0.10 = 9.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth $0.05. Justin has 120 nickels.
   \[
   120 \times 0.05 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth $0.01. Justin has 750 pennies.
   \[
   750 \times 0.01 = 7.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add up the values of all the coins:
\[
8 + 9.50 + 6 + 7.50 = 31 \text{ dollars}
\]

The total dollar amount in the jar is **31 dollars**."
"Janet spends $3.50 on ice cream, $7.50 each for two movie tickets, and $8.50 on a bracelet. Let's add up her total expenses:

- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets: $7.50 × 2 = $15.00
- Bracelet: $8.50

Total expenses: $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00

Janet's parents gave her $40. To find out how much she has left, we subtract her total expenses from the amount given by her parents:

$40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00

She has $13.00 left."
"Josh is open 5 days a week (Monday to Friday and Saturday). He services 3 cars each day he is open. So, in one week, he services:

\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 15 \text{ cars/week} \]

Since he gets paid $4 per car, his weekly earnings are:

\[ 15 \text{ cars/week} \times \$4/\text{car} = \$60/\text{week} \]

For 2 weeks, his earnings would be:

\[ \$60/\text{week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = \$120 \]

So, Josh makes \(\$120\) in 2 weeks."
"Randy starts with:
- 9 oatmeal cookies
- 4 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 sugar cookies

First, he ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor:
- Oatmeal: 9 - 1 = 8
- Chocolate chip: 4 - 1 = 3
- Sugar: 5 - 1 = 4

Next, he ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
- Oatmeal: 8 - 2 = 6

Then, he gave 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
- Sugar: 4 - 2 = 2

After that, he baked 4 of each flavor for dinner:
- Oatmeal: 6 + 4 = 10
- Chocolate chip: 3 + 4 = 7
- Sugar: 2 + 4 = 6

Now, let's add up all the cookies he has:
- Oatmeal: 10
- Chocolate chip: 7
- Sugar: 6

Total cookies = 10 + 7 + 6 = 23

"Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers. He would sell half of them at $5 each and the other half at $7 each.

Half of 12 is 6, so he would sell 6 toy soldiers at $5 each and 6 toy soldiers at $7 each.

The money earned from selling 6 toy soldiers at $5 each is:
6 * $5 = $30

The money earned from selling 6 toy soldiers at $7 each is:
6 * $7 = $42

The total money earned would be:
$30 + $42 = $72

Matthew would earn $72."
"First, let's calculate the total number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate gets home, he starts filling holes at a rate of 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. This means that each day, the net number of holes filled is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/night} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Now, we need to determine how many days it takes to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes."
"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School, and Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = 4000 \times \frac{3}{4} \]

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = 4000 \times 0.75 \]

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = 3000 \]

Now, to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract the average enrollment of Butler High School from that of Norman High School:

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 4000 - 3000 \]

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 1000 \]

So, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School."
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies made: 7995
Rainbow cookies: 2595
Oatmeal cookies: 3075

Now, let's subtract the rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total:

7995 - 2595 - 3075 = 2325

So, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Dr. Grumpus requested:
   - 16 test tubes
   - 7 beakers
   - 14 Petri dishes

2. Igor gathered:
   - Half as many test tubes as requested: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes
   - Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes
   - The correct number of beakers, but some were lost, so let's denote the number of beakers he actually brought as \( x \)

3. The total number of items on the lab bench is 29. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   8 \text{ (test tubes)} + x \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29
   \]

4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   8 + x + 16 = 29
   \]
   \[
   24 + x = 29
   \]

5. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 29 - 24
   \]
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

So, Igor brought 5 beakers to the lab bench. Since he was supposed to bring 7 beakers, the number of beakers he lost is:
\[
7 - 5 = 2
\]

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers."
"First, let's calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, for one table, the number of screws needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws per leg} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

James is putting together 4 tables, so the total number of screws needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws per table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the number of screws used from the total number of screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

So, the number of screws James will have left over is:
\[ 8 \]"
"There are 10 eggs in the first basket. The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, so it has 10 * 2 = 20 eggs.

"Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430. So, Kim raises:
\[ 430 + 320 = 750 \text{ dollars} \]

Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300. So, Maryam raises:
\[ 300 + 400 = 700 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up all the money raised by each girl:
\[ 430 + 750 + 300 + 700 = 2180 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount of money they all raised is:
\[ 2180 \text{ dollars} \]"
"First, let's understand the relationship between Aaron and Vanessa's running speeds and distances.

1. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
2. Aaron ran half the distance Vanessa ran, so Aaron ran \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.
3. Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes.

Since Aaron was twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa would take twice as long to run the same distance. Therefore, to find out how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles, we need to calculate the time it would take her to run 2 miles and then double it.

4. Aaron's time to run 2 miles is 16 minutes.
5. Since Vanessa is twice as slow, it would take her \( 16 \times 2 = 32 \) minutes to run 2 miles.
6. Therefore, to run 4 miles, it would take her \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \) minutes.

So, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the meals and wine for one night:

- They order 2 meals at $5 each, so the cost for the meals is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars.
- They also order a $5 bottle of wine.

So, the total cost for one night is \(10 + 5 = 15\) dollars.

Since they are open 2 days a week, the total cost for the week is \(15 \times 2 = 30\) dollars.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to find the cost price of each watermelon. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \]

Next, we need to calculate the selling price per watermelon, which includes a 25% profit. To find the selling price, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = \text{Cost price per watermelon} \times (1 + \text{Profit percentage}) \]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times (1 + 0.25) = 1.60 \times 1.25 = 2.00 \]

So, the selling price of each watermelon is:

\[ \boxed{2.00} \]"
"First, let's determine Dora's current age. If Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

James is twice as old as Dora, so James is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.

John had James when he was 19, so John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

John had his youngest son when he was 32, so his youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many oranges each person can peel in an hour and then find the difference.

First, let's determine how many oranges Ana can peel in an hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

Next, let's determine how many oranges Jane can peel in an hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- Ana peels 20 oranges.
- Jane peels 15 oranges.
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost is $400, and he gets it at 80% off.

The discount amount is:
\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

So, the cost of the radiator after the discount is:
\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

The cost for the mechanic is:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic to find the total amount Mark paid:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 230 \]"
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Chickens have 2 legs each.
2. Cows have 4 legs each.
3. Let's say the number of chickens is \( C \) and the number of cows is \( K \).

From the problem, we know:
- The total number of animals is 20, so \( C + K = 20 \).
- The total number of legs is 70, so \( 2C + 4K = 70 \).

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

We can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( C \):
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute it back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.

Final answer:

"First, we need to find out the total number of pizza slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices as follows:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many people are sharing the pizzas. Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people.

To find out how many slices each person can have, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

So, each person can have 14 slices of pizza."
