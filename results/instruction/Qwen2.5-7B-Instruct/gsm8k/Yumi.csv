"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and uses 4 for baking muffins for her friends. So, the total number of eggs used by Janet is:

3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for baking) = 7 eggs

The remainder of the eggs that she sells at the farmers' market is:

16 (total eggs) - 7 (used eggs) = 9 eggs

She sells each egg for $2, so the amount she makes from selling the eggs is:

9 (eggs) * $2 (per egg) = $18

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber, which means it takes 1 bolt of white fiber (since half of 2 is 1).

In total, it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts.

"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The value increased by 150%, so we need to find 150% of the original purchase price and add it to the original purchase price.

The original purchase price is $80,000. 150% of $80,000 is calculated as follows:
\[ 150\% \times 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

Adding this to the original purchase price gives us the new value of the house:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost, which includes the purchase price and the repair cost:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000."
"James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. He does this 3 times a week. 

So, the total distance he runs in one session is:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters} \]

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total distance he runs in a week is:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

Therefore, the total meters James runs a week is:
540 meters"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed each chicken consumes in a day and then determine how much is left for the evening meal.

Each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per meal, and there are 3 meals a day. So, each chicken gets:
\[ 3 \text{ cups/meal} \times 3 \text{ meals/day} = 9 \text{ cups/day} \]

Wendi has 20 chickens, so the total daily feed requirement for all the chickens is:
\[ 9 \text{ cups/chicken/day} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 180 \text{ cups/day} \]

In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed, and in the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed. So, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the evening meal, we subtract the morning and afternoon feed from the total daily requirement:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 140 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens \(\boxed{140}\) cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of 16 glasses, considering that every second glass is 60% of the regular price.

1. The regular price of one glass is $5.
2. The price of every second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = \$3\).

Now, let's break down the 16 glasses into two categories: the first glass in each pair and the second glass in each pair.

- For the first glass in each pair, Kylar will pay $5 for each of the 8 pairs (since 16 glasses divided by 2 is 8).
- For the second glass in each pair, Kylar will pay $3 for each of the 8 pairs.

So, the total cost is:
\[ 8 \times 5 + 8 \times 3 = 40 + 24 = \$64 \]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sheep each city has based on the given relationships and then sum them up.

1. Let's start with the number of sheep in Seattle. According to the problem, Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So, the number of sheep in Charleston is \(4 \times 20 = 80\).
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, the number of sheep in Toulouse is \(2 \times 80 = 160\).

Now, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together:
\[ 160 + 80 + 20 = 260 \]

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 260."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. Calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the file.
2. Add the time taken for the Windows update restart.
3. Calculate the time to download the remaining 60% of the file.
4. Sum up all the times to get the total download time.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Time to download 40% of the file:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Time for the Windows update restart:**
   - This is given as 20 minutes.

3. **Time to download the remaining 60% of the file:**
   - 60% of 200 GB is \( 0.60 \times 200 = 120 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \( \frac{120}{2} = 60 \) minutes.

4. **Total time:**
   - Sum of the times from each step: \( 40 \) minutes (first 40%) + \( 20 \) minutes (Windows update) + \( 60 \) minutes (remaining 60%) = \( 120 \) minutes.

So, the total time it takes to download the file is 120 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance John has traveled and then determine how far he is from home at the end of the 4 hours.

1. **First Leg of the Trip:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John drives for 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered during this time.
   - Next, he drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - Finally, he drives for the remaining 1.5 hours (since he has 4 hours total and spent 2.5 hours so far) at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Traveled:**
   - Total distance = Distance of first leg + Distance of return trip = 180 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - Since John is driving back home, the total distance he has traveled (315 miles) is the distance from his current position to home.

Therefore, at the end of those 4 hours, John is 315 miles from home."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her work hours into regular and overtime hours, then apply the appropriate rates.

1. **Regular Hours**: Eliza works 40 hours at her regular rate of $10 per hour.
2. **Overtime Hours**: Eliza worked 5 hours of overtime (45 total hours - 40 regular hours).

**Regular Earnings Calculation**:
\[ \text{Regular Earnings} = 40 \, \text{hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

**Overtime Rate Calculation**:
\[ \text{Overtime Rate} = 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]

**Overtime Earnings Calculation**:
\[ \text{Overtime Earnings} = 5 \, \text{hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

**Total Earnings Calculation**:
\[ \text{Total Earnings} = \text{Regular Earnings} + \text{Overtime Earnings} = \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

Eliza's earnings for this week are $460."
"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ downloads} \]

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, so the program had 70% of the second month's downloads:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \text{ downloads} \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

The program had a total of 366 downloads over the three months."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Each dozen costs $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Each dozen costs $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Each dozen costs $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330.

Now, we add up the total costs for each type of pastry to get the overall total cost:

- Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit becomes positive.

First, let's break down the costs and revenues:

1. **Initial Cost**: $90 (cost to plant the tree)
2. **Annual Costs**: $3 (water and feed the tree)
3. **Annual Revenue**: 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5

Now, let's calculate the net profit for each year after the initial year:

- **Net Profit per Year**: $10.5 (revenue) - $3 (cost) = $7.5

To find out how many years it will take to cover the initial cost, we divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:

- **Years to Cover Initial Cost**: $90 / $7.5 = 12 years

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

**12 years**"
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there.
2. After selling to the green house, she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
3. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
4. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there.
5. After selling to the orange house, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, the equation representing the remaining vacuum cleaners is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
\]

Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:

\[
\frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
\]

Add 2 to both sides:

\[
\frac{2x}{3} = 12
\]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:

\[
2x = 36
\]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[
x = 18
\]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

\[
\boxed{18}

"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we have:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after the contemporary dance enrollment:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Now, 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

So, the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is the remaining students after contemporary and jazz dance enrollments:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the following calculation:

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100\% = 0.60 \times 100\% = 60\% \]

Therefore, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the expected value of the profit for each purchase option.

1. **Jewelry Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value after increase: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125
   - Profit: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

2. **Electronic Gadgets Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value after increase: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096
   - Profit: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits:
- Jewelry profit: $125
- Electronic gadgets profit: $96

The merchant should choose the jewelry purchase to maximize profit, as it yields a higher profit of $125.

**Final numerical answer:**
$125"
"Each train travels 80 miles westward and then 150 miles northward over the two days. 

To find the total distance covered by each train, we simply add the distances together:

80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her earnings from both her teaching and coaching jobs and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She earns $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
\[ 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} = 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- She earns $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
\[ 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours/week} = 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from coaching are:
\[ 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Finally, we sum up her annual earnings from both jobs to get her total annual salary:
\[ 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} + 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} = 57500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Her annual salary is:
\[ \boxed{57500} \]"
"Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning. There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 * 7 = 28 days.

If she makes 3 egg omelets every day, then in 28 days, she will have made 3 * 28 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the number of dozens of eggs she will eat in 4 weeks is 84 / 12 = 7 dozens.

7 dozens"
"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time required to cover 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time already spent:**
   \[
   \text{Time spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Determine the remaining time to cover the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining time} = \text{Total time} - \text{Time spent} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - (4 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles}) = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Required speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Remaining time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks separately, then account for the spill, and finally sum the remaining water.

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink:**
   - The orange drink is two-thirds water.
   - Amount of water in the orange drink = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 \) liters = \( \frac{20}{3} \) liters ≈ 6.67 liters.

2. **Calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:**
   - The pineapple drink is three-fifths water.
   - Amount of water in the pineapple drink = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 \) liters = 9 liters.

3. **Account for the spill:**
   - We spill 1 liter of the orange drink.
   - The remaining orange drink is 9 liters.
   - The remaining water in the orange drink = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 9 \) liters = 6 liters.

4. **Calculate the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters:**
   - Total water = Water from the remaining orange drink + Water from the pineapple drink
   - Total water = 6 liters + 9 liters = 15 liters.

"To determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Raymond's current age.
2. Determine the age of Raymond's son when he was born.
3. Calculate the difference between Samantha's current age and the age of Raymond's son when he was born.

First, we know that Samantha is currently 31 years old. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond's current age is:
\[ 31 - 6 = 25 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. Therefore, the age of Raymond's son when he was born is 23 years before Raymond's current age:
\[ 25 - 23 = 2 \text{ years old} \]

This means Raymond's son was born 2 years ago. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"

"To find the original price of the book, we can use the relationship between the original price, the discount, and the final price. Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

Given that Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after a 25% discount, this means he paid 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

So, we can write the equation as:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:
\[ P = 26 \]

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered, excluding the boxes of pizza.

1. The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
2. The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
3. The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Now, let's add these amounts together to find the total cost of the non-pizza items:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. To find out how much she spent on the boxes of pizza, we subtract the cost of the non-pizza items from the total amount paid:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can find the number of boxes by dividing the total cost of the pizza by the cost per box:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\] boxes.

Therefore, Marie ordered \(\boxed{2}\) boxes of pizza."
"To find out how much Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the total cost for each type of item and then sum them up.

1. **Shorts:**
   - Number of pairs: 3

   - Total cost for shorts: \(3 \times 16.50 = 49.50\)

2. **Pants:**
   - Number of pairs: 3
   - Cost per pair: $22.50
   - Total cost for pants: \(3 \times 22.50 = 67.50\)

3. **Shoes:**
   - Number of pairs: 3
   - Cost per pair: $42
   - Total cost for shoes: \(3 \times 42 = 126\)

Now, we sum up the total costs for all the items:
- Total cost for shorts: $49.50
- Total cost for pants: $67.50
- Total cost for shoes: $126

Total amount spent: \(49.50 + 67.50 + 126 = 243\)

"Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, so in 60 days, she will consume 60 servings of ice cream.

Each carton contains 15 servings and costs $4.00. To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Since each carton costs $4.00, the total cost for 4 cartons is:

\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00/\text{carton} = \$16.00 \]

After 60 days, Cynthia will spend \(\boxed{\$16.00}\) on ice cream."
"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between these two points on his trip.

1. Henry's first stop was after 20 miles.
2. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip. So, he stopped at \(60 - 15 = 45\) miles.

Now, to find the distance between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance of his first stop from the distance of his second stop:

\[45 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles}\]

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

25 miles"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. So, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( B - 5 \).

We are also given that one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much. Therefore, the cost of the second pair of heels is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

Since the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( B - 5 \), we can set up the equation:
\[ B - 5 = 99 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Therefore, the boots cost \( \boxed{104} \) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up the relationship between Darrell's and Allen's ages using the given ratio and total age.

Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total age of Darrell and Allen is given as 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can find Allen's current age:

\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

Allen's age 10 years from now will be:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine the guesses of each friend.

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we add these guesses together and divide by the number of guesses (which is 3) to find the average.

\[ \text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average guess} = \frac{240}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average guess} = 80 \]

The average guess is 80."
"To find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily care time for all dogs.
2. Multiply the daily care time by the number of days in a week.

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day, and John has 10 dogs. So, the daily care time for all dogs is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly care time is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

70"
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Raymond has 40 jewels, and Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Then, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[ 25 - 2 = 23 \]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points that is, we calculate 25% of 4 points:

25% of 4 points = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 points + 1 point = 5 points.

To find the total points scored, we add the points from both halves of the game:

4 points (first 20 minutes) + 5 points (second 20 minutes) = 9 points

Total points scored: 9"
"Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Over 30 days, he will consume:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

The sale price is 4 yogurts for $5.00. To find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15. So, the total money from selling lego sets is:

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 8 video games he buys. Each video game costs $20, so the total cost is:

\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, John has $5 left. This means the money he spent on video games plus the $5 left equals the total money he had from selling the lego sets. We can confirm this by subtracting the money spent on video games from the total money he had:

\[ 195 - 160 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he has $5 left, this confirms the calculation is correct. The question asks how many lego sets he still has. Since he sold all his lego sets initially, the number of lego sets he still has is:

\[ 0 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 0 \]"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day. Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day. So, the distance he runs each of these days is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = \frac{3v}{2} \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   The total distance he runs in a week is the sum of the distances run on each of the three days:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying the right-hand side:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v + 3v}{2} = 3v + 3v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Given total distance:**
   We know that the total distance he runs in a week is 60 miles. Therefore:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]

5. **Solving for \( v \):**
   \[
   v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

**Final numerical answer:**
10 miles per hour"
"First, let's determine Dana's running and walking speeds based on her skipping speed.

Given:
- Dana's skipping speed = 3 miles per hour
- Skipping speed is half as fast as running speed.

So, running speed = 2 * skipping speed = 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

Next, we know that walking speed is one-fourth of running speed because running speed is four times faster than walking speed.

So, walking speed = running speed / 4 = 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the time spent running and walking. Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking in a six-hour period.

Time spent running = (1/3) * 6 hours = 2 hours.
Time spent walking = (2/3) * 6 hours = 4 hours.

Next, we calculate the distance traveled during each activity.

Distance running = running speed * time spent running = 6 miles/hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.
Distance walking = walking speed * time spent walking = 1.5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.

Finally, we add the distances to find the total distance traveled in six hours.

Total distance = distance running + distance walking = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 18 miles."
"If Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, then Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

Since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

Therefore, Brandon’s iPhone is 8 years old."
"When Polly is holding the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the gold javelin three times farther than her normal throwing distance. Her normal throwing distance is 400 feet. Therefore, when holding the gemstone, she can throw the javelin:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

200 feet"
"First, we need to determine the total number of pie pieces available initially. Since Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the initial total:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

26"
"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total calories from the bag of chips.
2. Determine how many calories you have left to consume from your daily target.
3. Calculate how many grams of chips correspond to the remaining calories.

First, we know that a 300g bag of chips has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories. Therefore, the total calories in the bag are:
\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories you have left to consume from your daily target of 2000 calories, after you have already consumed 1800 calories:
\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many grams of chips correspond to 200 calories. Since 300g of chips contain 1250 calories, we can find the number of grams per calorie and then use that to find the grams for 200 calories:
\[ \text{Grams per calorie} = \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{1250 \text{ calories}} = 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} \]
\[ \text{Grams for 200 calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \times 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, you can eat 48 grams of chips."
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed to make 20 candles.
2. Determine the total cost of the supplies.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed.
Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax} \]

Step 2: Determine the total cost of the supplies.
The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00. Therefore, for 2 pounds, the cost is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
If each candle is sold for $2.00, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is:
\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00 \]

Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.
\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:
\[ \$20.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

- On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
- On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[ 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \]

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
\[ 26 \times 4 = 104 \]

Therefore, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is 104."
"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of Post-it notes Candice had: 80.
2. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she used at work: 220.
3. Add the remaining Post-it notes to find out how many were in the package.

Let's do the math:

Initial Post-it notes: 80
Post-it notes used at work: 220
Remaining Post-it notes: 23

So, the equation to find the number of Post-it notes in the package is:

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = (80 + 23) - 220 \]

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = 103 - 220 \]

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = -117 \]

It seems there's a mistake in the calculation. The correct approach should be:

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = (80 + \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package}) - 220 = 23 \]

Rearranging the equation to solve for the number of Post-it notes in the package:

\[ 80 + \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} - 220 = 23 \]

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = 23 + 220 - 80 \]

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is 163."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost per blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, we add the amount spent on blue ties and red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total spent on red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{800} \]"
"To determine how many 6-inch pieces Tracy can obtain from a 4-foot piece of wire, we first need to convert the length of the wire into inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, a 4-foot piece of wire is:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we divide the total length of the wire in inches by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces Tracy can get:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ inches}}{6 \text{ inches/piece}} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.
- The building has 15 floors.
- Each floor contains 8 units.
- Therefore, the total number of units is \(15 \times 8 = 120\).

Step 2: Determine the number of occupied units.
- 3/4 of the building is occupied.
- Therefore, the number of occupied units is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90\).

Step 3: Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.
- The number of unoccupied units is \(120 - 90 = 30\).

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"First, let's calculate how many dozens of eggs Lloyd produces per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we calculate how much Lloyd makes per day by selling these dozens of eggs at $2 per dozen:

\[ 21 \text{ dozen} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$42 \]

To find out how much Lloyd makes in a week, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7):

\[ \$42 \times 7 = \$294 \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\$294\) per week from selling eggs."
"To solve this problem, we need to know the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. However, the distance is not provided in the question. Let's assume the distance from the starting point to the destination is \(D\) miles.

1. **Outbound Trip:**
   - Speed: 10 miles per hour
   - Time: 3 hours (from 1 PM to 4 PM)
   - Distance: \(D = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}\)

2. **Return Trip:**
   - Speed: 6 miles per hour
   - Distance: 30 miles (same as the outbound trip)
   - Time: \(\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{mph}} = 5 \, \text{hours}\)

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, the remaining weight he needs to remove is:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so to find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys."
"To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day and then find the difference.

**Thursday:**
- Truck tires: 6 tires * $60 per tire = $360
- Car tires: 4 tires * $40 per tire = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

**Friday:**
- Truck tires: 0 tires * $60 per tire = $0
- Car tires: 12 tires * $40 per tire = $480
- Total revenue on Friday = $0 + $480 = $480

**Difference in revenue:**
- Revenue on Thursday - Revenue on Friday = $520 - $480 = $40

The mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday compared to Friday."
"The Doubtfire sisters initially have 7 kittens. Their mother informs them that their two house cats, Patchy and Trixie, have had kittens as well. Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which means Patchy has 3 * 7 = 21 kittens. Trixie has had 12 kittens.

To find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we add the kittens from the shelter to the kittens from the house cats:

7 (adopted kittens) + 21 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 40 kittens.

The final numerical answer is:
40"
"Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, so she has:

30 - 2 = 28 lollipops remaining.

28 ÷ 2 = 14 bags.

Jean can fill 14 bags."
"To determine how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost of one trip to the movies and then see how many such trips he can afford with his $42.

The cost of one movie ticket is $7, and the cost of popcorn is $7. Therefore, the total cost for one trip to the movies is:
\[ 7 + 7 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many times Peter can afford this amount with his $42. We do this by dividing his total money by the cost of one trip:
\[ 42 \div 14 = 3 \]

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after the truck and driver are on it.
2. Determine how many boxes can be added to the truck without exceeding this remaining weight capacity.

First, let's find the remaining weight capacity of the bridge. The bridge can carry a maximum of 5000 pounds, and the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Therefore, the remaining weight capacity is:

\[ 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many boxes can be added to the truck without exceeding this remaining weight capacity. Each box weighs 15 pounds. So, we divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box:

120 raspberries + 67 raspberries = 187 raspberries

So, the total number of raspberries is 187."
"To find the number of good oranges, we need to subtract the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges.

1. Total oranges: 25
2. Bad oranges: 1
3. Unripe oranges: 20% of 25 = 0.20 * 25 = 5
4. Sour oranges: 2

Now, let's subtract these from the total:

Good oranges = Total oranges - Bad oranges - Unripe oranges - Sour oranges
Good oranges = 25 - 1 - 5 - 2
Good oranges = 17

"Janet first spends $500 on the material and $800 on the jeweler to construct the brooch. The total cost for these items is:

\[ \$500 + \$800 = \$1300 \]

Next, she pays 10% of this total amount to get it insured. To find 10% of $1300, we calculate:

\[ 10\% \times \$1300 = 0.10 \times \$1300 = \$130 \]

Adding the insurance cost to the initial total cost gives:

\[ \$1300 + \$130 = \$1430 \]

"After 20 years of service, Marcy becomes entitled to an additional 5% of the value of her pension per year. Her base annual pension is $50,000. 

For the first 20 years, she receives the base pension of $50,000 per year. After 20 years, she starts receiving an additional 5% of $50,000 per year.

The additional pension she receives after 20 years is:
\[ 50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500 \]

So, after 20 years, her total annual pension is:
\[ 50,000 + 2,500 = 52,500 \]

Since she quits after 30 years, she will receive this increased pension for the remaining 10 years of her service. Therefore, her annual pension after 30 years of service is:

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payments into two halves of the year.

1. For the first half of the year, she pays the full monthly rate of $140 for 6 months.
2. For the second half of the year, she pays 10% less than the full monthly rate for 6 months.

First, let's calculate the amount for the first half of the year:
\[ \text{First half payment} = 140 \times 6 = 840 \]

Next, we calculate the reduced monthly rate for the second half of the year:
\[ \text{Reduced monthly rate} = 140 \times (1 - 0.10) = 140 \times 0.90 = 126 \]

Now, we calculate the amount for the second half of the year:
\[ \text{Second half payment} = 126 \times 6 = 756 \]

Finally, we add the two amounts together to get the total payment for the year:
\[ \text{Total payment} = 840 + 756 = 1596 \]

Therefore, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:
\[ \boxed{1596} \]"
"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg). We know that Sophia has driven 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. 

First, we calculate the car's fuel efficiency:
\[ \text{Fuel Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Distance Traveled}}{\text{Gallons of Gas Used}} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Next, we use this fuel efficiency to find out how far Sophia can drive on a full tank of 12 gallons:
\[ \text{Distance on Full Tank} = \text{Fuel Efficiency} \times \text{Tank Capacity} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each time and reads for half as long, which is 1 hour. So, each session, he spends a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours on TV and reading.

He does this 3 times a week, so in one week, he spends 3 hours/session * 3 sessions/week = 9 hours.

Over 4 weeks, he would spend 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours.

Therefore, Jim spends 36 hours on TV and reading in 4 weeks."
"To find the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to consider the number of players and coaches for both the girls' and boys' teams from each school.

1. Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players.
2. Each school also sends 2 coaches (one for each team).

So, for each school:
- Number of players = 2 teams * 5 players/team = 10 players
- Number of coaches = 2 coaches

Therefore, the total number of people per school = 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people

Since there are 4 schools:
- Total number of people = 4 schools * 12 people/school = 48 people

Final numerical answer:
48"
"To find the total number of gems in the chest, we need to calculate the number of each type of gem and then sum them up.

1. **Diamonds**: There are 175 diamonds.
2. **Rubies**: There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So, the number of rubies is \(175 - 35 = 140\).
3. **Emeralds**: There are twice the number of emeralds than the rubies. So, the number of emeralds is \(2 \times 140 = 280\).

Now, we sum up the number of each type of gem:
\[ 175 \text{ (diamonds)} + 140 \text{ (rubies)} + 280 \text{ (emeralds)} = 595 \]

Therefore, the total number of gems in the chest is 595."
"First, let's determine the number of boys at Dr. Wertz's school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

Number of boys = 2 * Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 * 60
Number of boys = 120

Next, we need to find the total number of students at the school. This is the sum of the number of boys and the number of girls:

Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of students = 120 + 60
Total number of students = 180

Now, we know that there are 5 students for every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher:

Number of teachers = Total number of students / Number of students per teacher
Number of teachers = 180 / 5
Number of teachers = 36

Therefore, there are 36 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school."
"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to subtract the total amount of her allowance from her final total.

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks. So, the total allowance she receives is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. To find out how much money she started with, we subtract the total allowance from her final total:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Therefore, Bailey started with $60."
"To calculate how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week.
2. Determine the total number of students she teaches in a week.
3. Calculate the total amount of money she makes from the students.

First, let's calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week:

- She teaches 5 classes every weekday (Monday to Friday), so that's \(5 \times 5 = 25\) classes.
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.

So, the total number of classes in a week is \(25 + 8 = 33\).

Next, we calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week:

- Each class has 15 students.
- Therefore, the total number of students is \(33 \times 15 = 495\).

Finally, we calculate the total amount of money she makes from the students:

- She charges $15.00 per student.
- Therefore, the total amount of money she makes is \(495 \times 15 = 7425\).

So, Judy makes \(\boxed{7425}\) dollars in one week."
"The first recipe has 20 instructions.

The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, which means it has \(20 \times 2 = 40\) instructions.

"To calculate the total amount of money Tommy raises, we need to multiply the number of each item sold by its price and then add the totals together.

For brownies:
- Tommy sells 43 brownies at $3 per slice.
- Total from brownies = 43 slices * $3/slice = $129

For cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake at $4 per slice.
- Total from cheesecakes = 23 slices * $4/slice = $92

Now, we add the totals from both items:
- Total money raised = $129 (from brownies) + $92 (from cheesecakes) = $221

Therefore, Tommy raises a total of $221."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones without interest:

5 cell phones * $150 each = $750

Now, we need to calculate the interest for each cell phone. Since the interest is 2% per unit, the interest for one cell phone is:

$150 * 2% = $150 * 0.02 = $3

Since there are five cell phones, the total interest for all of them is:

5 * $3 = $15

Adding the total interest to the original total cost gives us the total amount to be paid:

$750 + $15 = $765

This $765 is to be paid in 3 monthly installments. So, the amount to be paid each month is:

$765 / 3 = $255

Therefore, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months."
"First, let's round the prices to the nearest dollar:

- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3
- Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2
- Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each type of flower:

- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3 = $36
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2 = $18
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2 = $34

Finally, we add up the earnings from all the flowers:

$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

Artie will make $88."
"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level. We know that each level has half the square footage of the level below it, and the top level has a square footage of 16 square feet.

Let's denote the square footage of each level from top to bottom as follows:
- Level 1 (top): 16 square feet
- Level 2: 16 * 2 = 32 square feet
- Level 3: 32 * 2 = 64 square feet
- Level 4 (bottom): 64 * 2 = 128 square feet

Now, we can calculate the total square footage of the sandcastle by summing the square footage of all levels:
Total square footage = 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
Average square footage = Total square footage / Number of levels
Average square footage = 240 / 4 = 60 square feet

The average square footage of a level is 60 square feet."
"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will consume in the first 365 days.

For the first 180 days, the puppy will consume 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food for the first 180 days is:
\[ 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

For the remaining days of the first year, which is \(365 - 180 = 185\) days, the puppy will consume 2 cups of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food for the remaining 185 days is:
\[ 185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total amount of dog food consumed in the first year:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags needed is:
\[ \frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags} \]

Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the amount of laundry David does:**
   - Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.
   - Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
   - Therefore, David does \( \frac{400}{4} = 100 \) pounds of laundry.

2. **Determine the amount of laundry Raymond does:**
   - Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.
   - Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
   - Therefore, Raymond does \( \frac{400}{2} = 200 \) pounds of laundry.

3. **Calculate the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David:**
   - Raymond does 200 pounds of laundry.
   - David does 100 pounds of laundry.
   - The difference is \( 200 - 100 = 100 \) pounds.

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds."
"To determine how much money Vincent saves, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in the most economical way versus the less economical way.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:
- Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
- Total cost: \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15.00 \)

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1.00 each:
- Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
- Total cost: \( 9 \times 1.00 = 9.00 \)

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two options:
- Cost difference: \( 15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00 \)

Therefore, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{6.00}

"The original cost of the grooming is $100. With a 30% discount, the cost is reduced by 30% of $100.

30% of $100 = 0.30 * $100 = $30

So, the discount amount is $30.

Subtract the discount from the original cost:
$100 - $30 = $70

The final cost of the grooming is $70."
"Each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water. So, the amount of water each girl got is:

\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they got together is:

\[ 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

The boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water distributed is:

\[ 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

The initial amount of water was 24 liters. Therefore, the amount of water left is:

\[ 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

10 liters of water were left."

1. Charlie starts with 10 stickers.
2. He buys 21 more stickers, so now he has \(10 + 21 = 31\) stickers.
3. He receives 23 more stickers for his birthday, so now he has \(31 + 23 = 54\) stickers.
4. Charlie gives 9 stickers to his sister, so now he has \(54 - 9 = 45\) stickers.
5. He uses 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so now he has \(45 - 28 = 17\) stickers.

Therefore, the final number of stickers Charlie has left is 17."
"First, let's calculate Alex's weight. Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. So, we calculate 4 times Grace's weight and then subtract 2 pounds.

\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \]
\[ 500 - 2 = 498 \]

So, Alex weighs 498 pounds.

Now, to find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight to Alex's weight.

\[ 125 + 498 = 623 \]

Their combined weights are 623 pounds."

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( W + L = 22 \)
2. \( W = L + 8 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find the number of games they won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of times the alarm rang over the three instances.

1. The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.
2. The second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time, which means it rang 4 * 3 = 12 times.
3. The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time, which means it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, we add up the total number of times the alarm rang:

4 (first time) + 12 (second time) + 6 (third time) = 22 times.

The alarm rang a total of 22 times."
"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the salary increase after 5 years.
2. Calculate the salary increase for the next three years.

**Step 1: Calculate the salary after 5 years.**

Sylvie's initial salary is $600. After 5 years, her salary is increased by 10% of the initial salary.

\[ \text{Salary after 5 years} = 600 + (0.10 \times 600) = 600 + 60 = 660 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the salary after an additional 3 years.**

The salary increases by 10% each year. So, we need to calculate the salary for each of the next three years.

\[ \text{Salary after 6 years} = 660 + (0.10 \times 660) = 660 + 66 = 726 \]

\[ \text{Salary after 7 years} = 726 + (0.10 \times 726) = 726 + 72.6 = 798.6 \]

\[ \text{Salary after 8 years} = 798.6 + (0.10 \times 798.6) = 798.6 + 79.86 = 878.46 \]

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is $878.46."
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies."
"Christina invited 16 friends, but since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we need to calculate the number of guests who are expected to attend.

1/4 of 16 friends don't show up, so:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \]

This means 4 friends won't attend. Therefore, the number of friends who will attend is:
\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \]

Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest. So, for 12 guests, the number of gift bags needed is:
\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost for 9 gift bags is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Christina will spend $18."
"To determine how much potato salad Ted needs to bring, we first calculate the amount each type of dinosaur will eat and then sum these amounts.

1. **Adult Dinosaur Consumption:**
   - Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
   - There are 20 adults.
   - Total for adults: \( 20 \times 10 = 200 \) lbs.

2. **Child Dinosaur Consumption:**
   - Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) lbs.
   - There are 5 children.
   - Total for children: \( 5 \times 5 = 25 \) lbs.

3. **Total Potato Salad Needed:**

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old."
"First, we need to determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, and Lee's current time is 38 seconds, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's current time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to calculate Gerald's new time after his diet improved his speed by 10%. A 10% improvement in speed means his time is reduced by 10% of his original time. We can calculate the reduction in time as:

\[ \text{Reduction in time} = 10\% \times \text{Gerald's original time} = 0.10 \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 4 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, Gerald's new time is:

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = \text{Gerald's original time} - \text{Reduction in time} = 40 \text{ seconds} - 4 \text{ seconds} = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

So, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in \(\boxed{36}\) seconds."
"Given that the number of dogs is 60, and there are two cats for every dog, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we first find the combined number of dogs and cats:

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120
Combined number of dogs and cats = 180

The number of rabbits is twelve less than this combined number:

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in Grade 5.

The total number of students is 200. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, we calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the rest of the students are girls, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. According to the problem, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scout is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the volume of tomatoes before they are cooked into sauce.
2. Calculate the number of cans of tomatoes used.
3. Calculate the number of tomatoes used based on the number of cans.

First, we know that the sauce made is 32 ounces, and the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked. This means that the volume of the tomatoes before cooking is twice the volume of the sauce. So, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking is:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes are needed to get 64 ounces of tomatoes. We do this by dividing the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is:
\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We start with 30 cars on the motorway.
2. After 15 minutes, some cars drive through the traffic jam.
3. In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through the traffic jam.
4. Additionally, 5 cars take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in both 15-minute intervals is \( x + 20 \).

Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that actually drove through the traffic jam is the total number of cars minus the 5 that took an exit. This can be expressed as:
\[ 30 - 5 = 25 \]

Therefore, we have the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

Final numerical answer:

Yesterday, she received 18 new potted plants. Adding these to her existing plants gives:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family. Since there are 40 window ledges, she will give away:

\[ 40 \text{ plants} \]

Subtracting the plants she gives away from the total number of plants she has:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we sum the number of doorbell rings from all friends:
\[20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175\]

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."

"John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner every weekday, which is 5 days. That's 3 glasses of water per day, so for 5 days, he drinks:

\[ 3 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ glasses} \]

On weekends, he drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and only one glass of water with dinner instead of soda. So for each weekend day, he drinks:

\[ 2 \text{ glasses/day} \]

For 2 days, that's:

\[ 2 \text{ glasses/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 4 \text{ glasses} \]

Adding the glasses of water from weekdays and weekends together:

\[ 15 \text{ glasses} + 4 \text{ glasses} = 19 \text{ glasses} \]

So, John drinks 19 glasses of water in a week."
"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the information given to set up a proportion.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box, then find its inner volume, and finally multiply by 3 for the total volume of all 3 boxes.

1. **Determine the inner dimensions:**
   - The original dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).
   - Inner length = 5 - 2 = 3 inches
   - Inner width = 6 - 2 = 4 inches
   - Inner height = 4 - 2 = 2 inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - Inner volume of one box = length × width × height
   - Inner volume of one box = 3 inches × 4 inches × 2 inches = 24 cubic inches

3. **Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:**
   - Total inner volume = inner volume of one box × 3
   - Total inner volume = 24 cubic inches × 3 = 72 cubic inches

**Final numerical answer:**
72 cubic inches"
"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the total hours of TV he watched each day and then solve for the unknown.

1. **Monday and Tuesday**: Frankie watched 1 hour each night.
   - Total for Monday and Tuesday: \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.

2. **Thursday**: Frankie watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show.
   - Total for Thursday: \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.

3. **Friday**: Frankie watched two 1-hour episodes.
   - Total for Friday: \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours.

4. **Total hours watched from Monday to Friday**: \(2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5\) hours.

5. **Total hours watched in the week**: 7 hours.

6. **Hours watched on Wednesday**: \(7 - 5.5 = 1.5\) hours.

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, we can find the number of 30-minute episodes by dividing the total hours watched on Wednesday by 0.5.

- Number of 30-minute episodes on Wednesday: \(1.5 \div 0.5 = 3\).

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

**Final answer**: 3"
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies. However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he had left is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

Final numerical answer:

"To find out how much the gas will cost after the cashback rewards, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without the cashback.
2. Calculate the total cashback for 10 gallons.
3. Subtract the total cashback from the total cost to get the final cost.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without the cashback.
- Cost per gallon = $3.00
- Number of gallons = 10
- Total cost = $3.00 * 10 = $30.00

Step 2: Calculate the total cashback for 10 gallons.
- Cashback per gallon = $0.20
- Number of gallons = 10
- Total cashback = $0.20 * 10 = $2.00

Step 3: Subtract the total cashback from the total cost to get the final cost.
- Final cost = Total cost - Total cashback
- Final cost = $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The final cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."
"To find out how many fruit roll-ups they ate on average, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each person ate.

For Beatrice:
- The roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

For Marcell:
- The roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Now, we add the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both:
- Total = \(48 + 42 = 90\).

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both, we divide the total by 2 (since there are two people):
- Average = \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\).

Therefore, on average, they ate 45 fruit roll-ups."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many feet Julia rows to reach the shore and then calculate the amount of water that enters the boat based on the given rate.

First, we find out how many feet Julia rows in 64 seconds. We know that it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, the rate at which she rows is:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} \]

Now, we calculate the total distance she rows in 64 seconds:

\[ \text{Distance} = \left(\frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}}\right) \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the rate at which water enters the boat, which is 2 liters for every 10 feet rowed. To find out how much water enters the boat over 80 feet, we use the following calculation:

\[ \text{Water} = \left(\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
2. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. So, Brittany's phone can hold \( \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \) photographs.
3. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as \( D \). Therefore, we have \( 300 = 50D \).
4. Solving for \( D \), we get \( D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \).

So, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is 6."
"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue from selling it, then find the difference between the two.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought:

- Sasha bought ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each.
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
  \]

- She also bought five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each.
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
  \]

- The total cost of the lumber is:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:

- She sells the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards. Since the price has increased by 50%, the new price per board is:
  \[
  \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15
  \]
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150
  \]

- She sells the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at the new price, which is also 50% higher than the original price of $16:
  \[
  \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24
  \]
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120
  \]

- The total revenue from selling the lumber is:
  \[
  \$150 + \$120 = \$270
  \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[
\$270 - \$180 = \$90
\]

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of \(\boxed{90}\)."
"Given the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, we can represent the amount of sugar used as \(7x\) and the amount of water used as \(13x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total amount of sugar and water used is given as 120 teaspoons. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 13x = 120\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[20x = 120\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now, to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used, we multiply \(x\) by 7:

\[7x = 7 \times 6 = 42\]

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is 42."
"John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children. Since each pair of shoes costs $60, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

2. Then, calculate the total cost: \(6 \text{ pairs} \times \$60/\text{pair} = \$360\).

Therefore, John paid \(\$360\)."
"On the first day, the customs officer counted 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles on the first day is:

2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

On the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day:

30 vehicles - 10 vehicles = 20 vehicles

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:

20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
2. Adrien's salary increased by 40% four years later. So, his new salary is:
   \[
   40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 = 40000 \times 1.40 = 56000
   \]
3. Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. So, if Lylah's salary four years ago was \( L \), then:
   \[
   40000 = L \times 1.30 \implies L = \frac{40000}{1.30} = \frac{400000}{130} = \frac{40000}{13} \approx 3076.92
   \]
4. Four years later, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. So, her new salary is:
   \[
   3076.92 \times 1.40 = 4307.69
   \]
5. The total salary the two were receiving four years later is:
   \[

"Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps. 

One-third of 60 is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \) letters.

These 20 letters are added to the pile of already-stamped letters, which now totals 30 letters.

To find out how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we subtract the 20 newly-stamped letters from the current total of 30 letters.

So, \( 30 - 20 = 10 \) letters were in the pile when Jennie began.

Therefore, the pile of already-stamped letters had 10 letters when Jennie began."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.
4. After using the spoons, she had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as \( x \).

So, the total number of spoons Julia had before using any was \( x + 5 \) (since her husband gave her 5 spoons).

After using 3 spoons, she had 12 spoons left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ x = 10 \]

So, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

"Given that each pepper costs $15, we can calculate the cost of the other items based on this information.

1. **Cost of a watermelon:**
   - A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.
   - Therefore, the cost of a watermelon = 3 * $15 = $45.

2. **Cost of an orange:**
   - An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs.
   - Therefore, the cost of an orange = $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the items Dillon is buying:

- **Cost of 4 watermelons:**
  - 4 * $45 = $180.

- **Cost of 20 peppers:**
  - 20 * $15 = $300.

- **Cost of 10 oranges:**
  - 10 * $40 = $400.

Finally, we add up the costs to find the total amount Dillon will spend:

- Total cost = $180 (watermelons) + $300 (peppers) + $400 (oranges) = $880.

**Total amount of money he will spend: $880.**"

"To determine how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the number of questions he was able to complete in each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions in each test.

For the first test:
- Total questions: 75
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 8 hours

First, we calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the first test:
\[ \text{Questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time available} = 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 40 \, \text{questions} \]

Since the test had 75 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is:
\[ \text{Incomplete questions} = \text{Total questions} - \text{Questions completed} = 75 - 40 = 35 \]

For the second test:
- Total questions: 100
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 6 hours

Next, we calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the second test:
\[ \text{Questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time available} = 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{questions} \]

Since the test had 100 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is:
\[ \text{Incomplete questions} = \text{Total questions} - \text{Questions completed} = 100 - 30 = 70 \]

Adding the incomplete questions from both tests:
\[ \text{Total incomplete questions} = 35 + 70 = 105 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

According to the problem, the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs. This can be written as:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

We are given that there are 12 blue gumballs, so \( B = 12 \).

Substituting \( B = 12 \) into the equation:
\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

Therefore, there are 70 pink gumballs.

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many cars are semi-automatic. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. 

So, the number of semi-automatic cars is:
20 (total cars) - 12 (automatic cars) - 4 (manual cars) = 4 semi-automatic cars.

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

Therefore, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic."
"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \). According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so the number of baby bees is \( 2Q \). Additionally, there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees is \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is the sum of the queens, baby bees, and worker bees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Since the number of worker bees is \( 4Q \), we substitute \( Q = 100 \) into the equation:
\[ 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\)."

Next, we need to determine how much money Jordan would earn if he spent those 14 hours working instead of playing video games. Since he earns $10 per hour at his part-time job, we can calculate his earnings as follows:

\[ 14 \, \text{hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$140/\text{week} \]

Therefore, if Jordan spent his video game time working instead, he would earn \(\boxed{140}\) dollars in one week."
"First, let's identify the non-food items and calculate their total cost before tax. The non-food items are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps. Their costs are as follows:

- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost of non-food items before tax = $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Next, we calculate the 10% tax on the non-food items:

Tax on non-food items = 10% of $10 = 0.10 * $10 = $1

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the non-food items to get the total cost of the non-food items after tax:

Total cost of non-food items after tax = $10 + $1 = $11

Now, let's add the cost of the food items (milk and eggs) to the total cost of the non-food items after tax:

- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3

Total cost of food items = $2 + $3 = $5

Finally, we add the total cost of the food items to the total cost of the non-food items after tax to get the final total cost:

Final total cost = $5 (food items) + $11 (non-food items after tax) = $16

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

$16"
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have:

- He already has 3 clients.
- He is talking to 5 potential clients.
- Therefore, the total number of clients will be \(3 + 5 = 8\).

Next, we calculate the total expenses for the supplies:

- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
- The cost of 1 bottle of bleach is $2.
- The cost of 1 pack of cloths is $5.
- Therefore, the cost for supplies per client is \(2 \times 2 + 1 \times 5 = 4 + 5 = 9\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total expenses for all clients:

- The total number of clients is 8.
- The cost per client is $9.
- Therefore, the total expenses are \(8 \times 9 = 72\) dollars.

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:

- Total income = $92
- Total expenses = $72
- Profit = Total income - Total expenses = $92 - $72 = $20

Therefore, the profit Kim will make each week is $20."
"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare that John can harvest in one harvest.
2. Determine how many times John can harvest within a year.
3. Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the number of harvests in a year.

Step 1: Pineapples per hectare per harvest
- There are 100 pineapples per hectare.

Step 2: Number of harvests in a year
- John can harvest every 3 months, so in a year (12 months), he can harvest 12 / 3 = 4 times.

Step 3: Total pineapples harvested in a year
- Total pineapples = Pineapples per hectare per harvest * Number of hectares * Number of harvests in a year
- Total pineapples = 100 * 10 * 4
- Total pineapples = 4000

Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year."
"Johnny has three Lego sets to pick up. 

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, which is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, which is \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

To find the total number of pieces Johnny picks up, we add the pieces from all three sets:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

Johnny picks up 2125 blocks."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return, which is 15 bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the first 6 hours leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
4. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first 6 hours and did not return in the second 6 hours return to the hive. Since 15 bees returned in the second 6 hours, 30 - 15 = 15 bees did not return in the second 6 hours. These 15 bees return in the last 6 hours.

So, in the last 6 hours, 15 bees return to the hive.

Final numerical answer:
15"
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we first need to calculate the total cost of the tickets.

The cost for 1 child ticket is $10.
The cost for 1 adult ticket is $12.

So, the total cost for both tickets is:
\[ 10 + 12 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means the amount she gave the cashier minus the total cost of the tickets equals $8.

Let's denote the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier as \( x \). We can set up the following equation:
\[ x - 22 = 8 \]

To find \( x \), we add 22 to both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 8 + 22 \]
\[ x = 30 \]

Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has first, and then use that information to find out how many friends James has.

1. Let's denote the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has as \( D \).

2. According to the problem, Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. Since Charlie has 12 friends, we can write the equation:
   \[
   3D = 12
   \]

3. Solving for \( D \):
   \[
   D = \frac{12}{3} = 4
   \]
   So, Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends.

4. Now, we know that James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy. Therefore, the number of friends James has is:
   \[
   4D = 4 \times 4 = 16
   \]

Therefore, James has 16 Facebook friends."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: 3 miles = 3 * 5280 feet = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles = 2 * 5280 feet = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Steve's time: \( \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet per minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \)
- Tim's time: \( \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet per minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \)

The difference in time between Tim and Steve is:
- \( 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \)

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at his house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

The final numerical answer is:
4 minutes"
"To calculate how much Shawnda made that day, we need to determine the total number of tires inflated and then convert that into dollars based on the cost per tire.

1. **Bicycles**: Each bicycle has 2 tires. On the first day, 5 people came by to get both tires inflated.
   - Total tires from bicycles: \(5 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ tires/person} = 10 \text{ tires}\)

2. **Tricycles**: Each tricycle has 3 tires. On the first day, 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated.
   - Total tires from tricycles: \(3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ tires/person} = 9 \text{ tires}\)

3. **Unicycle**: A unicycle has 1 tire. On the first day, 1 person came by to get their unicycle tire inflated.
   - Total tires from unicycle: \(1 \text{ person} \times 1 \text{ tire/person} = 1 \text{ tire}\)

Now, we add up all the tires:
- Total tires inflated: \(10 \text{ tires (bicycles)} + 9 \text{ tires (tricycles)} + 1 \text{ tire (unicycle)} = 20 \text{ tires}\)

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. To find out how much Shawnda made, we multiply the total number of tires by the cost per tire:
- Total cost: \(20 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 500 \text{ cents}\)

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost to dollars:
- Total dollars: \(500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 5 \text{ dollars}\)

Therefore, Shawnda made \(\boxed{5}\) dollars that day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys:

10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Next, we calculate the total cost of the cookies:

60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.00

Now, we determine how much change Carl receives if he pays with a $10 bill:

$10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00

So, the change Carl receives is $4.00."
"Let's work through the problem step by step, starting from the end and moving backwards.

1. **Final state**: 5 fries are left.
2. **Before the ants carried off the last fry**: There were 6 fries (5 + 1).
3. **Before the raccoon took two-thirds**: The raccoon took two-thirds, so one-third was left. If one-third is 6 fries, then the total before the raccoon took fries was \(6 \times 3 = 18\) fries.
4. **Before the pigeons ate**: Each of the three pigeons ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \(3 \times 3 = 9\) fries. Therefore, before the pigeons ate, there were \(18 + 9 = 27\) fries.
5. **Before the seagull ate half of what Dave ate**: The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, so Dave ate twice what the seagull ate. If the seagull ate 14 fries (the same as Dave), then Dave ate \(14 \times 2 = 28\) fries. Therefore, before the seagull ate, there were \(27 + 28 = 55\) fries.

So, the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was 55.

55"
"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the hours for the days he has three 1-hour classes:
- He has three 1-hour classes each on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.
- So, for these three days, he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours per day.
- Over three days, that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the hours for the days he has two 2-hour classes:
- He has two 2-hour classes each on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
- So, for these two days, he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours per day.
- Over two days, that's \(2 \times 4 = 8\) hours.

Now, let's add the hours from both types of days to get the total weekly hours:
- Total weekly hours = \(9 + 8 = 17\) hours.

Finally, to find the total hours for the entire semester, we multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks in the semester:
- There are 16 weeks in the semester.
- So, the total hours in one semester = \(17 \times 16 = 272\) hours.

Therefore, Kimo spends a total of 272 hours attending classes in one semester."
"First, let's convert all measurements to feet since the final answer needs to be in feet.

- Each roll is 4 inches long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each roll is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet long.
- Each chocolate croissant is 6 inches long, which is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet long.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Now, let's calculate the total length for each type of baked good:

- For the rolls: \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.
- For the chocolate croissants: \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.
- For the baguettes: \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

Adding these together gives the total length:

\( 100 + 60 + 120 = 280 \) feet.

So, if Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they will be 280 feet long."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we first calculate the monthly requirement for each type of ape and then double it for the 2-month period.

1. **Monkeys' requirement:**
   - Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(200 \times 2 = 400\) bananas.

2. **Gorillas' requirement:**
   - Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(400 \times 2 = 800\) bananas.

3. **Baboons' requirement:**
   - Baboons need 100 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(100 \times 2 = 200\) bananas.

Now, we add up the total number of bananas needed for all the apes over 2 months:
\[400 \text{ (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas}\]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Since the football field is 100 yards long, running back and forth once is 200 yards. Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so the total distance Blake runs is:

\[ 200 \, \text{yards} \times 15 = 3000 \, \text{yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards, and she does this 34 times, so the total distance Kelly runs is:

\[ 80 \, \text{yards} \times 34 = 2720 \, \text{yards} \]

Now, we need to find out how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Since Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards, the difference in the distance they run is:

\[ 3000 \, \text{yards} - 2720 \, \text{yards} = 280 \, \text{yards} \]

Therefore, the winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser."

"Finn initially watches 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 of them come out from under a lily pad, and 2 of them hide under a rock. 

To find out how many tadpoles Finn can see now, we need to consider the following:

- Initially, all 11 tadpoles are in the pond.
- 6 tadpoles come out from hiding, so the number of visible tadpoles increases by 6.
- 2 tadpoles then hide under a rock, so the number of visible tadpoles decreases by 2.

So, the calculation is:
11 (initially visible) + 6 (came out) - 2 (hid) = 15

Finn can now see 15 tadpoles in the pond."
"On Monday, the tank has a depth of 17 feet.

On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth is:
17 feet + 7 feet = 24 feet

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday, so the depth is:
(2/3) * 24 feet = 16 feet

The tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin:

- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3

Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Now, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by Locsin:

- Starfish: 5 fewer than Anakin = 10 - 5 = 5
- Sea horses: 3 fewer than Anakin = 6 - 3 = 3
- Clownfish: 2 more than Anakin = 3 + 2 = 5

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, we add the totals caught by Anakin and Locsin to find the overall total:

Total fish caught by Anakin and Locsin = 19 + 13 = 32

Final numerical answer:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

First, let's determine how many times the price will increase in 36 months. Since the price increases every two months, we divide 36 by 2:

\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

This means the price will increase 18 times over the 36 months.

The original price of the bag of marbles is $20. Each time the price increases, it increases by 20% of the original price. A 20% increase can be represented as multiplying by 1.20 (since 100% + 20% = 120%, or 1.20 in decimal form).

The formula to calculate the price after \( n \) increases is:

\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} \times (1.20)^n \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \). Using a calculator:

\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366 \]

Now, multiply this by the original price:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32 \]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months would be approximately $787.32."
"Given the information:

1. One red car costs $4.
2. The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
3. An action figure costs $5.

First, let's calculate the cost of the doll:
- Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5, the doll costs \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the toys:
- There are 5 red cars, each costing $4, so the total cost for the red cars is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) dollars.
- There are 3 action figures, each costing $5, so the total cost for the action figures is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.
- The doll costs $15.

Adding these together, the total cost of all the toys is:
\[20 + 15 + 15 = 50\]

Therefore, the total worth of all the toys is $50."
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant, we need to calculate the total cost of hiring the accountant and compare it to the lost income from doing her taxes herself.

1. Calculate the lost income from doing her taxes herself:
   - She loses $35 per hour for 3 hours.
   - Lost income = $35/hour * 3 hours = $105.

2. The cost of hiring the accountant is $90.

3. Compare the lost income to the cost of hiring the accountant:
   - Difference = Lost income - Cost of accountant
   - Difference = $105 - $90 = $15.

So, if Jackie hires the accountant, she will have $15 more. 

**Final Answer:**

"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she has chosen and then subtract this from her budget.

The cost of the computer is €1090.
The cost of the screen is €157.
The cost of the keyboard and mouse is €74.
The cost of the CD burner is €74.
The cost of the printer is €102.

First, we add up the costs of all the items:
\[ 1090 + 157 + 74 + 74 + 102 = 1497 \]

Elvira's budget is €1500. So, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
\[ 1500 - 1497 = 3 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is €3."
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she will need for 15 Spanish flans. Since each flan requires 3 eggs, we can find the total number of eggs required by multiplying the number of flans by the number of eggs per flan:

\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get 45 eggs. Since her neighbor gives her 9 eggs each time she babysits, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:

\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28, so \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

We can simplify the second equation:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:
\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

16"
"Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. If Ethel has $8, we can calculate how much money Jimmy has as follows:

Twice the money Ethel has is \(2 \times 8 = 16\).

Adding $2 to that amount gives \(16 + 2 = 18\).

So, Jimmy has $18."
"Pancho walks 20 miles each day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles each day, which is 2 days.

So, the total miles he walks from Monday to Friday is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

And the total miles he walks on the weekend is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding these together gives the total miles he walks in a week:
\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week is:
120 miles."
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the hat is given as $25.
2. The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so:
   \[
   \text{Cost of jacket} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so:
   \[
   \text{Cost of pants} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to get the total cost of each uniform:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs for each type of creature and then sum them up.

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is \(\boxed{1210}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we add up the ages of all four birds:
- Sally Two: 19 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years

Total age = \(19 + 8 + 16 + 8 = 41\)

The total age of the four birds is 41."
"First, let's calculate the total minimum monthly payment Jessica needs to make on all her debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. So, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum monthly payment and add it to the total minimum monthly payment:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

Therefore, the total monthly payment Jessica will make is:

$1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:

$1500 * 12 = $18000

So, Jessica pays $18000 in a year."
"To calculate the total time Billy will take to prep the potatoes, we need to consider the time taken for both peeling and cutting each potato.

1. Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
2. Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

First, we calculate the total time for peeling all 60 potatoes:
\[ 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the total time for cutting all 60 potatoes:
\[ 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 300 \text{ seconds} \]

Since 1 minute = 60 seconds, we convert 300 seconds to minutes:
\[ 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time for peeling and cutting:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."

   - Profit per gallon: Revenue per gallon - Cost per gallon
   - Profit per gallon: $10 - $5 = $5

4. **Determine the number of gallons they sold:**
   - They made a total profit of $25
   - Number of gallons sold: Total profit / Profit per gallon
   - Number of gallons sold: $25 / $5 = 5 gallons

5. **Determine the total cost of lemons:**
   - Cost of lemons per gallon: $3
   - Total cost of lemons: Number of gallons sold * Cost of lemons per gallon
   - Total cost of lemons: 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15

Therefore, they spent $15 on lemons."
"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to determine the total number of Chinese participants in the race.

Given:
- Total number of Asians: 240
- Number of Japanese: 80

The rest of the participants are Chinese, so we can calculate the number of Chinese participants as follows:
\[ \text{Number of Chinese} = \text{Total number of Asians} - \text{Number of Japanese} \]
\[ \text{Number of Chinese} = 240 - 80 = 160 \]

We are also given that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = \text{Number of Chinese} - \text{Number of boys} \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 160 - 60 = 100 \]

Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100."
"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent and car fuel.

1. Rent: \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his salary
   \[ \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \]

2. Car fuel: \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his salary
   \[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \]

Now, let's find out how much he has left after these expenses.
\[ 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \]

Next, he donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \]

So, after the donation, the amount left is:
\[ 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \]

Then, he gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$.
\[ 1250 - 200 - 700 = 350 \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations is:

"The winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the votes. Given that the total number of students who voted was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[ \text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60 \]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is:

\[ \text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of votes the loser got is 20."
"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we need to first find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, and Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies. Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( W \).

From the information given:
\[ 5W = 200 \]

Solving for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now, we know Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can denote the number of red roses as \( R \).

From the information given:
\[ R = 4W \]

Substituting the value of \( W \):
\[ R = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"Given that Jan is 30 years old, we can use the information provided to find Mark's age and then Jean's age.

First, let's determine Mark's age two years ago. We know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.

Jan's age two years ago was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.

Half of Jan's age two years ago was 28 / 2 = 14 years old.

So, two years ago, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.

Therefore, Mark's current age is 19 + 2 = 21 years old.

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's current age is 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

Jean is 23 years old."
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay race.

**Faster Team:**
Each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time for the faster team = 4 runners × 55 seconds/runner = 220 seconds.

**Less Well-Rounded Team:**
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Total time for the less well-rounded team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

**Difference in Time:**
The faster team's total time - the less well-rounded team's total time = 220 seconds - 222 seconds = -2 seconds.

Since the result is negative, it means the faster team actually wins by 2 seconds.

**Final Answer:**
The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the ratio of the probabilities and then converting it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[ \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \]

This means the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200\% \]

So, it is 200% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

**Final Answer: 200%**"

They both picked 30 apples."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = 10 cages * 5 pieces/cage = 50 pieces.

2. **Determine the total number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits:**
   - There are 20 pieces of straw for the rabbits.

3. **Calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats:**
   - Total straw distributed = 160 pieces.
   - Straw for hamsters + Straw for rabbits = 50 pieces + 20 pieces = 70 pieces.
   - Straw for rats = Total straw - Straw for hamsters and rabbits = 160 pieces - 70 pieces = 90 pieces.

4. **Determine the number of rats and the straw per rat:**
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Number of rats = Total straw for rats / Straw per rat = 90 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 15 rats.

5. **Determine the number of rats in each cage:**
   - The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups.
   - Number of rats per cage = Total number of rats / Number of cages = 15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats/cage.

The number of rats in each cage is 5."
"To calculate the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to account for the monthly interest compounded over the 3 months.

1. **Initial Amount**: $100
2. **Monthly Interest Rate**: 2% or 0.02

**Month 1:**
- Interest for the first month: $100 * 0.02 = $2
- Total amount after the first month: $100 + $2 = $102

- Total amount after the second month: $102 + $2.04 = $104.04

**Month 3:**
- Interest for the third month: $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808
- Total amount after the third month: $104.04 + $2.0808 = $106.1208

Rounding to the nearest cent, the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months is **$106.12**."
"Let's denote the number of bags the trader bought and sold as \( x \).

The cost to buy each bag is $20, and the cost to transport each bag is $2. Therefore, the total cost per bag is:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \]

The selling price per bag is $30. The profit per bag is:
\[ 30 - 22 = 8 \]

The trader made a total profit of $400. Therefore, the total profit can be expressed as:
\[ 8x = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold \(\boxed{50}\) bags."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The tickets cost $20.25 in total. The food cost $4.50 less than the tickets, so the food cost is:

\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the rides. Each ride costs $33, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is:

\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:

\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"

"To find the cost of 8 pens, we first need to determine the cost of one pen.

Given:
- A pencil costs $1.20.
- An eraser costs $0.30.
- A pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined.

So, the cost of one pen is:
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \text{Cost of a pencil} + \text{Cost of an eraser} \]
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \$1.20 + \$0.30 \]
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \$1.50 \]

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens:
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \text{Cost of one pen} \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \$1.50 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = \$12.00 \]

- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is $20 * 2 = $40.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Next, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- She babysits 4 times, earning $5 each time, so she earns $5 * 4 = $20 from babysitting.

Now, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from mowing the lawn:
- Let's say she needs to mow the lawn \( x \) times to earn enough money.
- Each time she mows the lawn, she earns $4, so she earns $4x from mowing the lawn.

Sara already has $10 saved. So, the total amount of money she will have after mowing the lawn \( x \) times is:
- The money she already has: $10
- The money she earns from babysitting: $20
- The money she earns from mowing the lawn: $4x

So, the total amount of money she will have is $10 + $20 + $4x = $30 + $4x.

We need this total to be at least $70 to afford the jacket and shoes:
\[ 30 + 4x \geq 70 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the inequality:
\[ 4x \geq 70 - 30 \]
\[ 4x \geq 40 \]
\[ x \geq 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

Final numerical answer:

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, as he walks around the edge. The park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles by 6 miles.

The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find the time \( t \) he spends walking, we use the formula:
\[ t = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \]

Substituting the distance (perimeter of the park) and the speed:
\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total.

So, the number of customers on the third day is \(500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\).

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. We know that both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 \) gallons. This can be written as:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we have:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool now has \( 8 \) gallons of water.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the shoes and the belt is $352.00.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Her part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find the number of hours, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed.

10% of $2000 is:
\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months at $165 per month:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Janeth's remaining balance by then will be:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"There are 4 roses in the vase. There are 7 more dahlias than roses, so there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias. 

To find the total number of flowers, we add the number of roses and dahlias together: 4 + 11 = 15.

Total number of flowers in the vase: 15."
"Given that Harriet is currently 21 years old, we can determine the ages of Adrian and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's age = 21 years
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age = 21 * 2 = 42 years
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's age = 21 * 3 = 63 years

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet's age = 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack's age = 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian's age = 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \]

The average age of the three in three years is 45 years."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.
4. The total points scored by the four students is 251.

First, we calculate Yuri's score:
- Half of Naomi's points: \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \)
- Yuri's score: \( 34 + 10 = 44 \)

Next, we calculate Brianna's score:
- Brianna's score: \( 68 + 17 = 85 \)

Now, we know the scores of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
- Naomi: 68 points
- Yuri: 44 points
- Brianna: 85 points

To find Jojo's score, we subtract the sum of the scores of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
- Total points: 251
- Sum of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna's points: \( 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \)

Jojo's score:
- \( 251 - 197 = 54 \)

Jojo scored 54 points."
"Carmen spends 10 minutes on each crossword puzzle and 5 minutes on each sudoku puzzle. 

For the crossword puzzles:
3 puzzles * 10 minutes/puzzle = 30 minutes

"Initially, the water tank has 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters, so the amount of water left in the tank is:

120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters

Celine then collects rainwater, which is twice the amount left in the tank. So, the amount of rainwater collected is:

2 * 30 liters = 60 liters

Adding the rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives:

30 liters + 60 liters = 90 liters

Therefore, the final amount of water in the tank is:

90 liters"
"Andy plants 90 geraniums. He plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, which means he plants 90 - 40 = 50 petunias.

To find the total number of flowers, we add the number of geraniums and petunias together:

90 (geraniums) + 50 (petunias) = 140 flowers.

So, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers."
"The company spends $15000 on advertising for the first year. For the second year, it spends a third of that amount, which is:

"To travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus, it takes Andrew 6 days. 

To travel from Rochester back to New Jersey by car, it will take half as many days as the bus trip, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days.

So, the total travel time for the round trip is the sum of the bus trip and the car trip:

\[ 6 \text{ days (bus)} + 3 \text{ days (car)} = 9 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, Andrew will travel for 9 days."
"First, let's calculate the new total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type cards and buying 14 grass type cards.

Initial count:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20
- Water type: 40

After the changes:
- Fire type: 30 (unchanged)
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

Now, let's find the total number of cards:
Total cards = 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96

The percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \frac{3200}{96} \]
\[ \text{Percentage} \approx 33.33 \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

"To find out how much Chad still owes, let's break down the cost of his burrito order step by step:

1. Base burrito: $6.50
2. Extra meat: $2.00
3. Extra cheese: $1.00
4. Avocado: $1.00
5. 2 sauces: $0.25 each, so $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
6. Upgrade for chips and a drink: $3.00

Now, let's add these amounts together to find the total cost before the gift card is applied:

$6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract this from the total cost:

$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Therefore, Chad still owes $9.00."

"First, let's calculate how many watermelons were ready for harvest when Ashlyn first went to the farm:

30% of 120 watermelons = 0.30 * 120 = 36 watermelons

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest, and the remaining watermelons were:

120 - 36 = 84 watermelons

When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest:

3/4 of 84 watermelons = 0.75 * 84 = 63 watermelons

So, after harvesting these 63 watermelons, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested is:

84 - 63 = 21 watermelons

Therefore, after the two weeks, 21 watermelons were not ready to be harvested."
"To find out how much Mark pays for everything, we need to calculate the total cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees.

1. **Total cost of the cars:**
   - Each car costs $20,000.
   - Mark buys 12 cars.
   - Total cost of the cars = $20,000 * 12 = $240,000.

2. **Tax on the cars:**
   - The tax rate is 10%.
   - Tax on the cars = 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000.

3. **Registration fees:**
   - The registration fee per car is $1,000.
   - Mark buys 12 cars.
   - Total registration fees = $1,000 * 12 = $12,000.

4. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the cars + Tax on the cars + Registration fees
   - Total cost = $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for everything is $276,000."
"On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, she collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is:
\[ 36 - 24 = 12 \]

12 penguins are still left sunbathing."
"Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. Since he eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes per day. Together, they eat 6 (Steve) + 3 (girlfriend) = 9 tomatoes per day.

To find out how many tomatoes they need in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 tomatoes/week.

Since a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed to produce 63 tomatoes is:
63 tomatoes / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines.

Steve needs 21 vines to meet their tomato consumption."

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens.
2. **First Cycle of Refilling**: After using these 25 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make 5 new pens (since 25 / 5 = 5).
3. **Second Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 5 new pens plus the 20 pens that were not used up in the first cycle (since 25 - 5 = 20). So, he has 25 pens again. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make 5 new pens again.
4. **Third Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 5 new pens plus the 20 pens that were not used up in the second cycle (since 25 - 5 = 20). So, he has 25 pens again. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make 5 new pens again.
5. **Fourth Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 5 new pens plus the 20 pens that were not used up in the third cycle (since 25 - 5 = 20). So, he has 25 pens again. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make 5 new pens again.
6. **Fifth Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 5 new pens plus the 20 pens that were not used up in the fourth cycle (since 25 - 5 = 20). So, he has 25 pens again. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make 5 new pens again.

After the fifth cycle, he will have 5 new pens plus the 20 pens that were not used up in the fifth cycle (since 25 - 5 = 20). So, he has 25 pens again. However, he cannot make any more new pens because he needs 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen, and he only has 25 pens, which is not enough to make another 5 pens.

So, the total number of pens he can have is the initial 25 pens plus the 5 new pens he made in each of the 5 cycles, which is 25 + 5 * 5 = 25 + 25 = 50 pens.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}

To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we add Jessa's age, Joan's age, and Mary's age together:

20 + 25 + 23 = 68.

The sum of the ages of the three girls is 68."
"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.
2. Calculate the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A.
3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students.
4. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C, which is the remaining students after those who went out through exits A and B.

Let's start with step 1:

1. 30% of 1000 students went out through exit A:
   \[
   0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]
   So, 300 students went out through exit A.

2. Calculate the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A:
   \[
   1000 - 300 = 700
   \]
   So, 700 students remained.

3. 3/5 of the remaining 700 students went out through exit B:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
   \]
   So, 420 students went out through exit B.

4. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C, which is the remaining students after those who went out through exits A and B:
   \[
   700 - 420 = 280

\[ R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

So, Robert has 27 candies.

James has 6 more candies than Robert, so:
\[ \text{James's candies} = R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James."

Pandora will read:
- Her own 1 book
- Dolly's 2 books

So, the total number of books read is:
- Dolly reads 2 (her own) + 1 (Pandora's) = 3 books
- Pandora reads 1 (her own) + 2 (Dolly's) = 3 books

Collectively, they will read 3 (Dolly) + 3 (Pandora) = 6 books.

"Mike was originally pen pals with 5 people and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. This means he is now pen pals with 3 people.

Each of these 3 people sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each person sends 10 pages of letters a week (2 letters * 5 pages each).

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 10 pages in response to each person's letters. So, for 3 pen pals, he writes 30 pages a week (10 pages per person * 3 people).

Mike writes a page every 6 minutes. To find out how many minutes he spends writing 30 pages, we multiply the number of pages by the time it takes to write one page:

30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

180 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours

Therefore, Mike spends 3 hours writing a week."
"First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason uses for his 15-minute calls with his boss each day. Since there are 30 days in the month, he uses:

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes he used for calls to other people:

\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the monthly plan of 1000 minutes:

So, Jason has 250 minutes left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin now has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Griffin now has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries.
4. Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. So, Griffin now has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Griffin now has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

The total number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 4 + 32 = 36 \).

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. The difference in the number of snails is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

So, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times (2F) \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium."
"To calculate the total amount Jean paid for the makeup services, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily cost of the makeup artist's services.
2. Calculate the weekly cost of the makeup artist's services.
3. Calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks of work.
4. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.

Let's start with the daily cost:

- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
- It takes 6 hours each day to do the makeup.
- Therefore, the daily cost is \( 250 \times 6 = 1500 \) dollars.

Next, we calculate the weekly cost:

- The makeup artist needs to do the makeup 4 times a week.
- Therefore, the weekly cost is \( 1500 \times 4 = 6000 \) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks of work:

- The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
- Therefore, the total cost before the discount is \( 6000 \times 5 = 30000 \) dollars.

Finally, we apply the 10% discount:

- The discount is 10% of the total cost.
- Therefore, the discount amount is \( 30000 \times 0.10 = 3000 \) dollars.
- The final amount Jean paid is \( 30000 - 3000 = 27000 \) dollars.

So, Jean paid a total of $27,000."
"To find out how much each person paid, we first need to calculate the total cost of the party supplies. We do this by adding up all the individual expenses:

- Cake ingredients: $12
- Birthday presents: $43
- Decorations: $15
- Invitations: $4
- Goodie bags: $22

Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, which means the cost was divided among 3 people. To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3:

$96 ÷ 3 = $32

Each person paid $32."
"The chef bought 4 bags of onions, with each bag weighing 50 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of onions is:

4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

The cost of onions is $1.50 per pound, so the total cost is:

200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 5 cookies, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 13 cookies, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

In total, Sue ate \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.

Her sister ate \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies in total.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

Her sister consumed \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.

The difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister is \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories.

Therefore, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."
"To find the number of boys in the third class, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of students in the school:**
   - Each class has 20 students.
   - There are 3 classes.
   - Total students = 20 students/class * 3 classes = 60 students.

2. **Number of boys and girls in the school:**
   - The school is 50% boys and 50% girls.
   - Number of boys = 50% of 60 = 0.5 * 60 = 30 boys.
   - Number of girls = 50% of 60 = 0.5 * 60 = 30 girls.

3. **Number of girls in the first and second classes:**
   - First class has 15 girls.
   - Second class has 12 girls.
   - Total girls in the first and second classes = 15 + 12 = 27 girls.

4. **Number of girls in the third class:**
   - Total girls in the school = 30.
   - Girls in the third class = Total girls - Girls in the first and second classes = 30 - 27 = 3 girls.

5. **Number of boys in the third class:**
   - Each class has 20 students.
   - Third class has 3 girls.
   - Boys in the third class = Total students in the third class - Girls in the third class = 20 - 3 = 17 boys.

**Final answer:**
17 boys are in the third class."
"Travis originally had 61 apps. After deleting 9 apps, he had:

"Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Since he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

Therefore, the number of wolves he killed today is 3 times the number of cougars, which is 3 * 12 = 36 wolves.

Now, let's add up all the animals he killed:

- Wolves: 10 (last night) + 36 (today) = 46 wolves
- Cougars: 15 (last night) + 12 (today) = 27 cougars

Total animals killed: 46 wolves + 27 cougars = 73 animals.

73 animals"
"Bill starts on the 3rd floor. 

To find the floor he ends up on, we calculate 4 times his starting floor (3) plus 6:

"First, let's find out how many times Anne went down the slide. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. Since Mitchel went down 30 times, we calculate 30% of 30:

\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide 9 times less than Mitchel. Therefore, Anne went down the slide:

\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Next, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. Since Anne went down 21 times, Robert went down the slide:

\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

So, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

84"
"First, let's determine the total number of cows initially in the ten stalls. Since each of the ten stalls has 20 cows, the total number of cows is:

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the twenty stalls. So, the number of new cows in each stall is:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in each stall after the new cows are added. Initially, each stall had 20 cows, and now each stall has 2 more cows, so:

\[ 20 \text{ cows} + 2 \text{ cows} = 22 \text{ cows/stall} \]

To find the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:

\[ 22 \text{ cows/stall} \times 8 \text{ stalls} = 176 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 176 \]"
"To find out how much money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the total value of each type of coin and bill, and then sum these values.

So, Brady has a total of \(\boxed{45}\) dollars in his piggy bank."
"First, let's calculate the total number of 10-foot sections in the 200-foot tall redwood:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any of it is:

\[ 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Since termites ate 30% of the redwood, they ate:

\[ 0.30 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 2400 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the remaining weight of the redwood is:

\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 5600 \text{ pounds} \]"
"Nancy owes $0.50 for each of the 8 books, which amounts to:

\[ 8 \times 0.50 = 4.00 \]

Additionally, she has to pay a flat $2.00 fee for having at least one book that's over a week overdue. Therefore, the total amount she has to pay is:

\[ 4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \]

Nancy has to pay a total of $6.00."
"Given that Andrea has 52 apples, we can start by determining how many apples Jamal has. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Andrea's apples} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]

Substituting the number of apples Andrea has:

\[ 52 = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]

Solving for Jamal's apples:

\[ \text{Jamal's apples} = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

Next, we know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. So, we can calculate the number of bananas Jamal has:

\[ \text{Jamal's bananas} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can find the number of bananas Andrea has:

\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{\text{Jamal's bananas}}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits:

\[ \text{Total fruits} = \text{Andrea's apples} + \text{Andrea's bananas} + \text{Jamal's apples} + \text{Jamal's bananas} \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 168 \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits is 168."
"To determine how many cups of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making over the two days and then figure out how much flour is required based on the given ratio.

1. Calculate the total number of cookies:
   - Today: 36 cookies
   - Tomorrow: 30 cookies
   - Total: 36 + 30 = 66 cookies

2. Determine the amount of flour needed:
   - 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies.
   - To find out how many cups are needed for 66 cookies, we set up a proportion:
     \[
     \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}}
     \]
   - Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{132}{12} = 11 \text{ cups}
     \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate how many pennies are in that stack.

1. Calculate two thirds of 9,300 pennies:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9,300 = \frac{2 \times 9,300}{3} = \frac{18,600}{3} = 6,200 \text{ pennies} \]

2. Convert the number of pennies to dollars. Since 100 pennies equal 1 dollar:
\[ \frac{6,200 \text{ pennies}}{100 \text{ pennies/dollar}} = 62 \text{ dollars} \]

The total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is 62 dollars."
"Maddison initially has 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box. So, the total number of marbles in the boxes is:

\[ 5 \times 50 = 250 \]

\[ 250 + 20 = 270 \]

Therefore, Maddison has 270 marbles now."
"First, let's determine the number of trees Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, and Chris has 6 trees, Ferdinand has:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ trees} \]

Next, we calculate the number of trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has 3 trees, twice that number is:

\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Adding 5 to this number gives us the number of trees Harry has:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ trees} \]

Now, to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:

\[ 11 - 3 = 8 \]

So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand.

8"
"Carmen has $100.

Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has:
\[ 100 + 25 = 125 \]

Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has:
\[ 125 + 50 = 175 \]

To find out how much all three girls have combined, we add their amounts together:

"To determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then compare it to her budget.

1. Calculate the brokerage fee:
\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \times \$350,000 = 0.05 \times \$350,000 = \$17,500 \]

2. Calculate the transfer fee:
\[ \text{Transfer fee} = 12\% \times \$350,000 = 0.12 \times \$350,000 = \$42,000 \]

3. Calculate the total price of the house:
\[ \text{Total price} = \text{Selling price} + \text{Brokerage fee} + \text{Transfer fee} \]
\[ \text{Total price} = \$350,000 + \$17,500 + \$42,000 = \$409,500 \]

4. Determine how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Total price} - \text{Budget} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = \$409,500 - \$400,000 = \$9,500 \]

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to subtract the transfer fees, brokerage fees, and the remaining loan amount from the selling price.

1. **Calculate the transfer fees:**
   Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000
   = 0.03 * $400,000
   = $12,000

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000
   = 0.05 * $400,000
   = $20,000

3. **Calculate the total fees:**
   Total fees = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee
   = $12,000 + $20,000
   = $32,000

4. **Calculate the net proceeds:**
   Net proceeds = Selling price - Total fees - Remaining loan amount
   = $400,000 - $32,000 - $250,000
   = $118,000

Therefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are $118,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and calculate the time for each part.

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:** This takes 20 minutes.

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:** It takes 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees. 
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:** It takes 5 minutes less time than the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - The total heating time is \(20 + 28 = 48\) minutes.
   - So, the cooking time is \(48 - 5 = 43\) minutes.

4. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:** This is the sum of the heating time and the cooking time.
   - Total time = \(20 + 28 + 43 = 91\) minutes.

Therefore, the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 91 minutes."
"To find out how much the real estate agent spent on all the ads, we need to calculate the total cost for the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the newspaper ads:
- The cost per newspaper ad is $5.
- The number of newspaper ads bought is 50.
- Therefore, the total cost for newspaper ads is \(5 \times 50 = 250\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the television ads:
- The cost per television ad is $75.
- The number of television ads bought is 15.
- Therefore, the total cost for television ads is \(75 \times 15 = 1125\) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs for both types of ads to find the overall expenditure:
- Total cost for newspaper ads: $250
- Total cost for television ads: $1125
- Therefore, the total amount spent on all the ads is \(250 + 1125 = 1375\) dollars.

The real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on buying all the ads."
"The juggler can juggle 16 balls in total. Half of these balls are golf balls, so there are 16 / 2 = 8 golf balls. Half of these golf balls are blue, so there are 8 / 2 = 4 blue golf balls.

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary bought, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then sum them up.

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has \(300 / 2 = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, we add the M&Ms from all three bags together:
\[300 + 312 + 150 = 762\]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. John has 2 houses.
2. Each house has 3 bedrooms.
3. Each bedroom has 2 windows.
4. There are an additional 4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms.

First, calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:
- Each house has 3 bedrooms.
- Each bedroom has 2 windows.
- So, each house has \(3 \times 2 = 6\) windows in the bedrooms.

Since there are 2 houses, the total number of bedroom windows is:
- \(2 \times 6 = 12\) windows.

Next, calculate the number of additional windows in each house:
- Each house has 4 additional windows.
- So, for 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is:
- \(2 \times 4 = 8\) windows.

Now, add the number of bedroom windows and the additional windows to get the total number of windows:
- Total windows = bedroom windows + additional windows
- Total windows = \(12 + 8 = 20\)

Therefore, the total number of windows between the houses is 20."

\[ 20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00 \]

So, the change the cashier gives back is $5.00."
"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we first need to calculate the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

1. The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches the body of the sweater takes. So, the collar takes:
\[ \frac{900}{10} = 90 \text{ stitches} \]

2. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar. So, the rosette takes:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \text{ stitches} \]

3. The total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We can now calculate the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette:
\[ 90 + 180 = 270 \text{ stitches} \]

4. Subtract the stitches used for the collar and the rosette from the total number of stitches to find the number of stitches used for the sleeves:
\[ 1800 - 270 = 1530 \text{ stitches} \]

5. Since the sweater has two sleeves, we divide the remaining stitches by 2 to find the number of stitches per sleeve:
\[ \frac{1530}{2} = 765 \text{ stitches} \]

Each sleeve takes 765 stitches."
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the tomato seeds:
- She bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.
- Each packet of tomato seeds costs $40.

So, the total cost for the tomato seeds is:
\[ 20 \text{ packets} \times \$40 \text{ per packet} = \$800 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the celery seeds:
- She bought 80 packets of celery seeds.
- Each packet of celery seeds costs $30.

So, the total cost for the celery seeds is:
\[ 80 \text{ packets} \times \$30 \text{ per packet} = \$2400 \]

Now, we add the total costs for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds to find the total amount of money used:
\[ \$800 + \$2400 = \$3200 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is:
\[ \$3200 \]"
"To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each part and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\) lines from the first scene.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\) lines from the second scene.

Now, we sum up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
- Solo song: 54 lines
- First scene: 36 lines
- Second scene: 48 lines

Total lines = \(54 + 36 + 48 = 138\)

"First, let's calculate the number of cards with the letter A on them:

\[
\text{Cards with A} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32
\]

Next, we find the number of remaining cards after removing the cards with A:

\[
\text{Remaining cards} = 80 - 32 = 48
\]

Now, we calculate the number of cards with the letter B on them, which is half of the remaining cards:

\[
\text{Cards with B} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
\]

Then, we find the number of remaining cards after removing the cards with B:

\[
\text{Remaining cards} = 48 - 24 = 24
\]

Next, we calculate the number of cards with the letter C on them, which is \(\frac{5}{8}\) of the remaining cards:

\[
\text{Cards with C} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15
\]

Finally, we find the number of cards with the letter D on them, which are the remaining cards after removing the cards with A, B, and C:

\[
\text{Cards with D} = 24 - 15 = 9

"To calculate the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to multiply the number of holes by the time it takes to dig each type of hole and then sum the results.

For the small holes:
- Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes
- Number of small holes = 30
- Total time for small holes = 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes

For the large holes:
- Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes
- Number of large holes = 15
- Total time for large holes = 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Now, we add the total time for small and large holes:
- Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- Total time in hours = 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes."
"The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 20 + 20 = 40.

40"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

Sam is 6 years old."

Therefore, Peter paid a total of 7 dollars."
"First, let's determine the number of spots on a mamba. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can find the number of spots on a mamba by dividing the number of spots on a cobra by 2:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots on all the cobras. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots on cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

Then, we calculate the total number of spots on all the mambas. There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots on mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we find the combined total number of spots on all the cobras and mambas:

\[ \text{Combined total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this combined total:

\[ \text{Half the combined total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of people at the soccer game. There are 12 team members and each brings 2 guests, so the guests total to 12 * 2 = 24 guests. Adding the 12 team members and 3 coaches, the total number of people is 12 + 24 + 3 = 39 people.

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3: 39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

Finally, to find out how much Maddy will spend, we multiply the number of pizzas by the cost per pizza: 13 * $15 = $195.

Maddy will spend $195."
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones and then find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads.

1. Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace. Therefore, the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones is:
   \[
   8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. The total length of each necklace is 25 inches. Subtracting the length occupied by the topaz gemstones from the total length gives us the length available for the sterling silver beads:
   \[
   25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find out how many sterling silver beads can fit into the 17 inches of space, we divide the available length by the length of one bead:
   \[
   \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{\frac{1}{4} \text{ inch/bead}} = 17 \times 4 = 68 \text{ beads}
   \]

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace."
"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. 

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we add the stories from both weeks:
- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Adding these together gives us the total number of stories:
\[60 + 120 + 180 = 360\]

Therefore, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is 360."

"Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents:
- 1 quarter = 25 cents
- 5 quarters = 5 * 25 = 125 cents
- 1 dime = 10 cents
- 2 dimes = 2 * 10 = 20 cents

So, the total amount of money Kelly has is:
125 cents (from quarters) + 20 cents (from dimes) = 145 cents

Now, if she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, the amount of money she will have left is:
145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents

Therefore, Kelly will have 90 cents left."
"To find the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars and then subtract the stars in the other rows.

1. Calculate the total number of stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and 2 rows of 6 stars:
   - 3 rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars
   - 2 rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars
   - Total stars in these rows: \(24 + 12 = 36\) stars

2. The flag has 76 stars in total. Subtract the 36 stars from the other rows to find the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
   - Stars in 5-star rows: \(76 - 36 = 40\) stars

3. To find the number of 5-star rows, divide the number of stars in 5-star rows by 5:
   - Number of 5-star rows: \(40 \div 5 = 8\)

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, we first need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight for 80 flagstones is:

\[ 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to carry this total weight, given that each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds. We divide the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks} \]

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour. The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

To find the time it takes for the car in the slow lane to cover 480 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the slow lane:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"First, let's determine how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, Izzy has:

\[ 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Now, let's find out how many medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times 39 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of medals given out:

\[ 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ bars per adult} = 24 \text{ bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bars the adults get from the total number of bars to find out how many bars are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ bars} - 24 \text{ bars} = 16 \text{ bars} \]

There are 8 children, and the 16 bars are to be shared equally among them:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ bars per child} \]

Each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so the actual working time is 2.5 hours.

First, convert the working time into minutes:
2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Next, calculate how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:
150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Since Susan earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, her total earnings are:
15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

Susan earns $75 for the online task."
"Let's break down the points for each player after the first three rounds and then add the extra points for the fourth round.

1. Mike has 21 points.
2. Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
3. Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Now, let's add the extra points for the fourth round. A player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point. Mike's total becomes \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point. Jim's total remains 18 points.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point. Tony's total becomes \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Now, let's sum up the total points for all three players after the fourth round:

- Mike: 22 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 43 points

Total points = \(22 + 18 + 43 = 83\)

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members, each consuming 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and eating rice at both lunch and dinner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily consumption of rice by the household.
2. Determine the total weekly consumption of rice.
3. Calculate how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last based on the weekly consumption.

**Step 1: Calculate the total daily consumption of rice.**

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since each person eats rice at both lunch and dinner, each person consumes:
\[ 0.2 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 0.4 \, \text{kg/day} \]

For 5 members of the household, the total daily consumption is:
\[ 0.4 \, \text{kg/person/day} \times 5 \, \text{persons} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total weekly consumption of rice.**

There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly consumption is:
\[ 2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{kg/week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.**

To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's calculate the total number of crates sold:

- Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates.
- On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
- On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
- On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

Now, let's add these numbers together:

20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:

120 (target) - 65 (sold) = 55 crates

So, Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week."
"To determine the total cost of the antique desk for Carmen, we need to calculate the sum of all the bids she made. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Bid**: Carmen starts with the opening bid of $200.
2. **Bids by Others**: There are 3 other people who each bid once. Since the bids rise by $50 each time, the bids by the other people are:
   - First other person: $200 + $50 = $250
   - Second other person: $250 + $50 = $300
   - Third other person: $300 + $50 = $350
3. **Carmen's Bids**: Carmen bids after each of the other people, so her bids are:
   - After the first other person: $300
   - After the second other person: $350
   - After the third other person: $400

Now, let's sum up all the bids:
- Opening bid: $200
- First bid by Carmen: $300
- Second bid by Carmen: $350
- Third bid by Carmen: $400
- Bids by the other people: $250, $300, $350

Adding these together:
\[ 200 + 300 + 350 + 400 + 250 + 300 + 350 = 2150 \]

So, the total cost of the desk for Carmen is $2150."
"To calculate the total cost John pays for the driving service in a year, we need to consider both the mileage charges and the monthly bonuses.

1. **Mileage Charges:**
   - Distance to work one way: 30 miles
   - Total distance per day: 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles
   - Distance per week: 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week
   - Distance per year: 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year
   - Cost per mile: $2
   - Total mileage cost per year: 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000

2. **Monthly Bonuses:**
   - Bonus per month: $150
   - Number of months in a year: 12
   - Total bonus cost per year: $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost per year: $30,000 (mileage) + $1,800 (bonuses) = $31,800

"To find out how many minutes Peter has to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

So, the total time exercised on Monday and Sunday combined is:
23 minutes + 16 minutes = 39 minutes.

Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined on Tuesday. Therefore, we need to multiply the total time by 2:
39 minutes * 2 = 78 minutes.

So, Peter has to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the structure of the folding process. Each piece of paper, when folded, creates two pages on the front and two pages on the back. Therefore, each piece of paper contributes 4 pages to the tabloid.

Given that the tabloid has 32 pages, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper used by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages each piece of paper contributes:

\[ \text{Number of pieces of paper} = \frac{\text{Total number of pages}}{\text{Pages per piece of paper}} = \frac{32}{4} = 8 \]

So, 8 pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid."
"Annika started with $50. She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

So, she spent $25 on food and snacks. She also spent an additional $10 on rides. Therefore, the total amount spent is:

\[ 25 + 10 = 35 \]

To find out how much is left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:

\[ 50 - 35 = 15 \]

So, the amount left is $15."
"To find out the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of books sold in the first year.
2. Determine the number of books sold in the second year.
3. Calculate the earnings for the second year.

First, we know that Elise started with 250 books and currently has 50 unsold books. This means she has sold \(250 - 50 = 200\) books in total over the three years.

We are also given that she sold 45 books in the current (third) year. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, she sold \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books in the first year.

Now, we can find out how many books she sold in the second year by subtracting the books sold in the first and third years from the total books sold:
\[200 - 90 - 45 = 65\]

Since each book sells for $20, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is:
\[65 \times 20 = 1300\]

So, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is:
\[1300\]"
"To calculate how much money Watson made in April, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Watson's weekly earnings from his hourly wage.
2. Add the weekly bonus to his weekly earnings.
3. Determine the number of weeks in April.
4. Multiply his weekly earnings by the number of weeks in April.

Step 1: Watson's weekly earnings from his hourly wage
- Watson works 10 hours a day for 5 days a week.
- Therefore, he works 10 * 5 = 50 hours a week.
- He earns $10 per hour.
- So, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are 50 * $10 = $500.

Step 2: Add the weekly bonus
- Watson gets a $300 bonus each week.
- Therefore, his total weekly earnings are $500 (hourly wage) + $300 (bonus) = $800.

Step 3: Determine the number of weeks in April
- April typically has 4 weeks.

Step 4: Multiply his weekly earnings by the number of weeks in April
- Watson's total earnings for April are $800 * 4 = $3200.

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April if the company performed very well for the whole month."
"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. 

To find out how many people he beat, we calculate 80% of 20:
\[ 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \]

"To determine the number of new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many extra arms and legs they will grow based on the given intervals.

- Extra arms grow every 3 days.
- Extra legs grow every 5 days.

First, let's calculate the number of extra arms grown in 15 days:
- The number of 3-day intervals in 15 days is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).
- So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

Next, let's calculate the number of extra legs grown in 15 days:
- The number of 5-day intervals in 15 days is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).
- So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

Now, we add the number of extra arms and legs to find the total number of new limbs:
- Total new limbs = 5 (extra arms) + 3 (extra legs) = 8.

Therefore, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, the cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
\[ 5 \times \$100 + \$700 = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

The total amount Theo wants to save is $2000. Therefore, the total amount he can spend on the trip is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

Now, let's sum up the costs of the suits, suitcases, and flight ticket:
\[ \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$2050 \]

The amount left for buying gifts is:
\[ \$4000 - \$2050 = \$1950 \]

Therefore, Theo has to spend \(\boxed{1950}\) on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"First, let's calculate the daily egg consumption for the family.

- Three people eat 3 eggs each, so that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
- The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each, so that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.

Adding these together, the family consumes \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs per day.

To find out how many eggs the family consumes in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

So, \(13 \times 7 = 91\) eggs.

The family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"If Quinn is 30 years old, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, then Jane is:

30 - 3 = 27 years old.

Since Trent is 5 years older than Jane, Trent's age is:

27 + 5 = 32 years old.

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old."
"Given that Cera is currently 46 years old, six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.

Let's denote Noah's age six years ago as \( N \). According to the problem, six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ N = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, Noah was 20 years old six years ago. This means Noah's current age is \( 20 + 6 = 26 \) years old.

The problem also states that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time. Therefore, the population of Chile six years ago was:
\[ 3000 \times 20 = 60000 \]

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, the current population of Chile is:
\[ 60000 \times 2 = 120000 \]

Therefore, the population of Chile now is:
\[ 120000 \]"
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem, the number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).

The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{1}{2}D \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3.5D = 105 \]

To find \( D \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3.5:

\[ D = \frac{105}{3.5} = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

Final numerical answer:
30"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

Total invited: \(12 + 12 = 24\) people

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness

Now, we calculate the number of people who had previous commitments:

- \(1/4\) of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness: \(8 \times \frac{1}{4} = 2\) people

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is:

- 8 (due to illness) + 2 (previous commitments) = 10 people

Finally, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited to find out how many people show up:

- \(24 - 10 = 14\) people

Therefore, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is 14."
"First, let's calculate the number of marbles Solomon's father gave him. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, and his father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought. So, the number of marbles his father gave him is:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8
\]

Now, let's find the total number of marbles Solomon has. He originally had 50 marbles in the store, bought 20 more from Johanna, and received 8 more from his father. Therefore, the total number of marbles is:

\[
50 + 20 + 8 = 78
\]

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of the marbles is:

\[
78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kgs}
\]

The total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is:

\[
\boxed{156 \text{ kgs}}

"To calculate the cost to fill the pool, we first need to determine the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep, so the volume \( V \) is calculated as:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \times 5 \, \text{ft} \]
\[ V = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

The cost to fill the pool is $.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = V \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{\$/cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 12 \, \text{\$} \]

The cost to fill the pool is $12."
"Given that the classroom has 30 boys, we can use the information provided to find the number of girls and nongendered children.

1. The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys:
   \[ \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

2. The number of nongendered children is 1/10 the number of boys:
   \[ \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \]

Now, to find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
\[ \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

**123**"
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

Since the ratio is 1:3, for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires. Therefore, if there are 45 electric wires, we can set up the following proportion to find the number of electric poles:

\[ \text{Number of electric poles} = \frac{\text{Number of electric wires}}{3} \]

Substituting the given number of electric wires:

\[ \text{Number of electric poles} = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15."
"At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, 1/4 of 40 people is 10 people.

This means that 30 people stayed at the party (40 - 10 = 30).

We are told that 22 men stayed at the party. Since the total number of people who stayed is 30, the number of women who stayed can be calculated as follows:

30 (total people who stayed) - 22 (men who stayed) = 8 women who stayed.

So, the number of women left at the party is 8."
"The magazine costs half as much as a book, and the book costs $4. So, the magazine costs:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = \$2 \]

A pen costs $1 less than a magazine, so the pen costs:

\[ 2 - 1 = \$1 \]

The pen costs $1."
"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. We know that Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together make 26 pencils. 

To find out how many pencils are in each box, we subtract the 2 loose pencils from the total:

26 pencils (total) - 2 pencils (loose) = 24 pencils (in boxes)

Since these 24 pencils are in 3 boxes, we can find out how many pencils are in each box by dividing:

24 pencils / 3 boxes = 8 pencils per box

Now, we know that Jam has 26 pencils in total and Meg has 46 pencils. To find out the total number of pencils both Jam and Meg have, we add their pencils together:

26 pencils (Jam) + 46 pencils (Meg) = 72 pencils (total)

To find out how many boxes they need to store all 72 pencils, we need to know how many pencils each box can hold. Since we know each of Jam's boxes holds 8 pencils, we can assume that each box can hold 8 pencils. Therefore, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

72 pencils / 8 pencils per box = 9 boxes

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

9 boxes"
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to calculate the total weakening effect from the ice cubes and the cream added.

First, let's calculate the weakening effect from the ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we can find out how many ice cubes were added by dividing 65 by 13:

\[ \frac{65}{13} = 5 \]

So, 5 ice cubes were added. Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, the total weakening effect from the ice cubes is:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters} \]

Next, we need to account for the cream added. The problem states that any added liquid also weakens the coffee. Since 15 milliliters of cream were added, this adds an additional 15 milliliters of weakening.

Adding the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream gives us the total weakening:

\[ 60 + 15 = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio and how it applies to the number of new records the people received.

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means for every new record received, 2 old records are given up.

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records given up as follows:

\[ \text{Total old records given up} = 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records per new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior programmers. Since the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Given that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month, the total monthly payment to junior programmers is:

\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

Next, we need to find the number of senior programmers. Since the total number of employees is 100 and there are 40 junior programmers, the number of senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so their monthly salary is:

\[ \text{Monthly salary of a senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

The total monthly payment to senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:

\[ \text{Total monthly payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:

\[ \boxed{224000} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal be \( x \).
2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the total number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).
3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the total number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).
4. We know that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, \( x + 6 = 20 \).

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ x + 6 = 20 \]
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

14"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\).
3. He passes 14 out to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\).
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends: \(14 \times 2 = 28\). So, he now has \(8 + 28 = 36\).
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\).
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\).

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31."
"To fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, it needs an additional 40 percentage points of charge. Given that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to recharge the remaining 40 percentage points as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes per percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."
"Erin starts with 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her another 10 lollipops, so she has:

7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

If Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella, she will have:

17 - 3 = 14 lollipops left.

She has 14 lollipops left."
"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

\[ \text{Rewards earned} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards. The coupon applied twice the amount of the rewards off the price. So, the discount from the coupon is:

\[ \text{Discount from coupon} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the rewards and the discount from the amount spent:

\[ \text{Amount to be paid} = 43 - 4 - 8 = 31 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A:

- Annual pay: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
- Tax: 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B:

- Annual pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Remaining pay after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax on remaining pay: 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:

- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:

$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate, which is Job B."
"First, we calculate the number of ruined castles by finding 40 percent of the total castles in Scotland:

\[ \text{Number of ruined castles} = 220 \times \frac{40}{100} = 220 \times 0.4 = 88 \]

Next, we find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. Since half of the ruined castles are unmanned:

\[ \text{Number of unmanned ruined castles} = 88 \times \frac{1}{2} = 44 \]

So, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is 44."
"To find the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total cost for each offer and then subtract the smaller total from the larger one.

For Furniture United:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

For Cozy Homes:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, we find the difference between the two total costs:
- Cost difference: $3,450 - $3,350 = $100

The cost difference between the two offers is $100."
"To find out how many guns each person would have if they shared them equally, we first need to calculate the total number of guns they have combined.

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, Richard (RJ) has 1 gun, and Richard (the other one) has 5 guns. So, the total number of guns is:

\[ 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 \]

Now, we need to divide this total number of guns equally among the four of them:

\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

So, if they were to share their guns equally, each of them would have 6 guns."
"To find out how much sugar Mason needs, we can calculate the total amount of sugar required for the suckers and the fudge separately and then add them together.

For the suckers:
- Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for 1 batch.
- For 8 batches, he would need \(30 \times 8 = 240\) ounces of sugar.

For the fudge:
- Mason needs 70 ounces of sugar for 1 batch.
- For 1 batch, he would need \(70 \times 1 = 70\) ounces of sugar.

Now, we add the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge:
- Total sugar needed = \(240 + 70 = 310\) ounces.

Therefore, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge."
"First, let's calculate the value of the shares after the first year. Maria initially buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the initial total value is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price per share after the increase, we calculate:

\[ \$8 \times 1.50 = \$12 \]

So, the value of the 8 shares after the first year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To find the new price per share after the decrease, we calculate:

\[ \$12 \times 0.75 = \$9 \]

So, the value of the 8 shares after the second year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72 \]

Therefore, the final value of all Maria's shares is:

\[ \$72 \]"
"Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate \(2 \times 3 = 6\) hot dogs.

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate \(6 \div 2 = 3\) hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate: \(3 - 2 = 1\).

John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke."
"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group will then have \( x - 10 \) students.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can write the equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation, we get:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The smallest group, therefore, has:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( C \) represent the number of cows and \( H \) represent the number of chickens. According to the problem, Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so we can write:
\[ H = 2C \]

We also know that the total number of animals is 60, so:
\[ C + H = 60 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know there are 20 cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times C) + (2 \times H) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times 20) + (2 \times 40) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

So, the animals on Farmer Brown's farm have a total of 160 legs."
"Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. After 4 weeks, he will be juggling:

3 (initial balls) + 1 (ball added each week) * 4 (weeks) = 3 + 4 = 7 balls

However, during the performance, he drops 3 balls. Out of these, 2 are caught and 1 is lost. So, he loses a total of 1 ball from his juggling act.

Therefore, the number of balls Josh starts juggling on stage is:

7 - 1 = 6 balls

6 balls"
"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself.

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

The total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, plus the container itself, is 260 pounds."

\[24 + 48 + 15 = 87\]

So, Laurel has 87 baby outfits for her baby."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the additional distance Tyson should run each day based on his coach's advice.
2. Determine the total distance Tyson runs each day after following the coach's advice.
3. Calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month (assuming June has 30 days).

Step 1: Calculate the additional distance.
Tyson runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters. So, the additional distance is:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

Step 2: Determine the total distance Tyson runs each day after following the coach's advice.
\[ 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters per day} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month (30 days).
\[ 6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:
\[ 180000 \text{ meters} \]"
"Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so:
\[ \text{Juice Box B} = \text{Juice Box A} + 5 = 4 + 5 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so:
\[ \text{Juice Box C} = \text{Juice Box A} + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Juice Box C} - \text{Juice Box B} = 11 - 9 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

"To calculate the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have, we need to multiply the number of tables by the number of legs each type of table has and then add the results together.

For the 40 tables with 4 legs each:
40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs

For the 50 tables with 3 legs each:
50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs

Now, we add the two results together:
160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs

The total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies a week, and each bag contains 36 cookies.

Her son's lunch box gets 4 cookies each day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies her son eats in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ cookies} \]

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies her husband eats in a week is:
\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ cookies} \]

To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we subtract the number of cookies her son and husband eat from the total number of cookies in the bag:

"To find out what percentage more the factory is making per day now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily revenue from tractors.
2. Calculate the daily revenue from silos.
3. Find the difference in daily revenue between the current and past production.
4. Calculate the percentage increase based on the original revenue.

Step 1: Calculate the daily revenue from tractors.
- They sold 10 tractors a day at $100 each.
- Daily revenue from tractors = 10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day.

Step 2: Calculate the daily revenue from silos.
- They now sell 5 silos a day at $220 each.
- Daily revenue from silos = 5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day.

Step 3: Find the difference in daily revenue.
- Difference in revenue = $1100/day (silos) - $1000/day (tractors) = $100/day.

Step 4: Calculate the percentage increase.
- Percentage increase = (Difference in revenue / Original revenue) * 100
- Percentage increase = ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%.

The factory is making 10% more per day now compared to when they were making tractors."
"To calculate the total amount Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to break down the costs for each item and then sum them up for a year.

1. **Food Cost:**
   - Food costs $25 per week.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost for food is \(25 \times 4 = 100\) dollars.
   - For a year, the cost for food is \(100 \times 12 = 1200\) dollars.

2. **Treats Cost:**
   - Treats cost $20 per month.
   - For a year, the cost for treats is \(20 \times 12 = 240\) dollars.

3. **Medicine Cost:**
   - Medicine costs $100 per month.
   - For a year, the cost for medicine is \(100 \times 12 = 1200\) dollars.

Now, we sum up all the yearly costs:
- Yearly cost for food: $1200
- Yearly cost for treats: $240
- Yearly cost for medicine: $1200

Total yearly cost = \(1200 + 240 + 1200 = 2640\) dollars.

Therefore, Madeline spends \(\boxed{2640}\) dollars on her dog per year."
"To find the total number of hours Peyton's after-work activities will take, we need to calculate the duration of each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Yoga class on Monday**: 1 hour
2. **Cooking class on Tuesday**: 3 times the yoga class, so \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours
3. **Cheese-tasting event on Wednesday**: 0.5 hours (30 minutes)
4. **Museum tour on Thursday**: Half the duration of the cooking class, so \(\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\) hours
5. **Errands on Friday**: 2 hours

"April is donating plant pots for the daisies and roses. The school asked for 30 plant pots for the daisies and twice as many for the roses, which means:

- Daisies: 30 plant pots
- Roses: 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots

So, the total number of plant pots needed is 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90 plant pots.

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the number of plant pots needed from the number of plant pots she bought:

100 (bought) - 90 (needed) = 10

April has 10 plant pots left over."
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent and gave away from the total amount she had initially.

1. Andrea had $36 initially.
2. She spent $11 on a sweater.
3. She gave her brother $4.

So, the total amount spent and given away is $11 + $4 = $15.

"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming. He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Next, he watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is:

\[ 3 \times 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let's denote the total time spent on vacation as \( T \). Therefore, we have:

\[ 0.30T = 15 \text{ hours} \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ hours}}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. So, the time spent sightseeing is:

\[ 0.40 \times 50 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time John spent sightseeing is:

\[ \boxed{20 \text{ hours}} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle earns from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so:

\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money she earns from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so:

\[ 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, let's add the money she already has in her savings, the money from her first job, and the money from her second job to find the total amount of money she has:

\[ 80 \, \text{dollars} + 200 \, \text{dollars} + 75 \, \text{dollars} = 355 \, \text{dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so to find out how much more money Annabelle needs to save, we subtract the total amount of money she has from the cost of the phone:

\[ 400 \, \text{dollars} - 355 \, \text{dollars} = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save \(\boxed{45}\) dollars."
"The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet.

The second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so its height is:
6 feet + 5 feet = 11 feet

The combined height of the shortest and second trees is:
6 feet + 11 feet = 17 feet

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two trees, so:
2 * 17 feet = 34 feet

The height of the tallest tree is 34 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the toy cars and teddy bears Dean bought.

The cost of 6 toy cars at $2 each is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

The cost of 5 teddy bears at $1 each is:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \]

Adding these together gives the total amount spent:
\[ 12 + 5 = 17 \]

Dean started with $28. After spending $17, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 28 - 17 = 11 \]

His mother then gives him an extra $10, so the total amount of money Dean has now is:
\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost for Morgan and her friends to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. Then, we'll subtract this total from her budget to see how much money is left for her friends.

1. **Cost of mini-golf for one person**: $5
2. **Cost of go-karts for one person (2 rides)**: $10 * 2 = $20
3. **Total cost for one person (mini-golf + go-karts + arcade tokens)**: $5 + $20 + $5 = $30

Now, let's denote the number of friends Morgan can invite as \( f \). The total cost for Morgan and her friends would be:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 30 \times (f + 1) \]

Morgan's budget is $90, so we set up the equation:

\[ 30 \times (f + 1) = 90 \]

To find \( f \), we solve the equation:

\[ f + 1 = \frac{90}{30} \]
\[ f + 1 = 3 \]
\[ f = 3 - 1 \]
\[ f = 2 \]

So, Morgan can invite 2 friends.

**Final numerical answer:**

"Marisa gets $5 every day as pocket money. She spends 4 lollipops at 25 cents each. 

First, calculate the total cost of the lollipops:
4 lollipops * $0.25 per lollipop = $1.00

Now, subtract the cost of the lollipops from her daily pocket money to find out how much she saves each day:
$5.00 - $1.00 = $4.00

If she saves for 5 days, the total amount she saves is:
$4.00 per day * 5 days = $20.00

Marisa puts $20.00 in her piggy bank if she saves for 5 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount Billy spent on gumballs:**
   - Billy bought 40 gumballs.
   - Each gumball costs $0.05.
   - Total cost for gumballs = 40 * $0.05 = $2.

2. **Calculate the total amount of money Billy had before buying gumballs:**
   - Since he spent $2 on gumballs, and this was half of his change, the total change he had before buying gumballs is $2 * 2 = $4.
   - Billy started with $10, so the amount he spent on candy is $10 - $4 = $6.

3. **Calculate the amount of candy Billy bought:**
   - The candy costs $1.5 per pound.
   - Amount of candy bought = $6 / $1.5 per pound = 4 pounds.

Therefore, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy."
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( S \).

According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. Carver is 45 years old, so we can write the equation as:

\[ 45 = 2S - 5 \]

To find \( S \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 45 + 5 = 2S \]
\[ 50 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ S = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs, which is \(75 + 100 = 175\) miles. So, the distance from the third city to the first city is \(175 - 50 = 125\) miles.

Now, let's add up the distances for one complete trip:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily travel distance:
\[\frac{18000}{900} = 20\]

So, the train goes 20 days between services.

"First, let's determine the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed. The collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. The average is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

So, a collie bed takes 5 pounds of stuffing.

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

For the chihuahua beds:
\[
4 \text{ beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per bed} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

For the collie beds:
\[
3 \text{ beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per bed} = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Adding these together gives the total amount of stuffing needed:
\[
8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds."

1. **First Leg (to friend's house):**
   - Distance: 210 miles (200 miles + 10 miles detour)
   - Speed: 70 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours

2. **Return Leg (back home):**
   - Distance: 240 miles
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

**Total Time:**
- Total time = Time to friend's house + Time back home = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours

The trip took a total of 6 hours."
"To find out how many fourth-grade boys were at Small Tree School on Friday, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of fourth-grade boys at the school.
2. Subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

First, we know there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is:
\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

On Friday, 4 fourth-grade boys were absent. Therefore, the number of boys present on Friday is:
\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

So, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 49."
"There are 6 girls in the park. If there are twice the number of boys, then there are \(6 \times 2 = 12\) boys in the park.

"To find the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass, we need to add the points she has already scored and then determine how many more points she needs to reach the total of 42 points.

Jane's scores so far:
- First test: 15 points
- Second test: 18 points

Total points from the first two tests:
15 + 18 = 33 points

To pass, Jane needs at least 42 points in total. So, we subtract the points she has already scored from the total required points:
42 - 33 = 9 points

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on her third test to pass.

The minimum number of points she must score on the third test to pass is 9."
"First, let's determine the number of people kicked out for shoplifting. We know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks. The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times that number minus 5. So, we calculate:

\[ 4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

Next, we calculate the number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. This number is three times the number of shoplifters:

\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we know the total number of people kicked out for the three specific reasons (refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence) is:

\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

Given that the total number of people kicked out is 50, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:

\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:

\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara.
2. Sara scored 8 points, so three times Sara's points would be \(3 \times 8 = 24\) points.
3. This means that after scoring 14 points, Erin has 24 points.
4. To find out how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we subtract 14 from 24.

So, \(24 - 14 = 10\).

Therefore, Erin had 10 points before scoring 14 points.

"To calculate the total cost for the senior gifts, we need to break down the expenses into different categories and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames for all seniors:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - There are 44 seniors.
   - Total cost for picture frames = 44 * $20 = $880.

2. **Cost of etching for all picture frames:**
   - The etching cost is 20% of the picture frame cost.
   - Etching cost per frame = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4.
   - Total etching cost = 44 * $4 = $176.

3. **Cost of pins for 2 seniors:**
   - Each pin costs $5.
   - Total cost for pins = 2 * $5 = $10.

4. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers.
   - Number of officers = 1/4 * 44 = 11.
   - Each cord costs $12.
   - Total cost for cords = 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of picture frames + Cost of etching + Cost of pins + Cost of cords
- Total cost = $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1,198.

The total amount spent on the senior gifts is $1,198."

"On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday, which is:
\[ 14 \times 2 = 28 \text{ pairs} \]

On the last day of the sale, they sold one-half the amount that they did on Saturday, which is:
\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ pairs} \]

However, six pairs were returned because they didn't fit, so the actual number of pairs sold on the last day is:
\[ 14 - 6 = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

To find the total number of pairs sold during the sale, we add the pairs sold on each day:
\[ 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \text{ pairs} \]

Therefore, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is:
50 pairs."
"Hallie had dance practice for 1 hour on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays. On Saturdays, she had dance practice that lasted twice as long as Tuesday's class, which means she had 2 * 1 = 2 hours on Saturdays.

1 (Tuesday) + 2 (Thursday) + 2 (Saturday) = 5 hours.

So, Hallie had 5 hours of dance practice in a week."
"The company bought equipment worth $400,000 in total. 40% of this equipment was faulty, so the value of the faulty equipment is:

40% of $400,000 = 0.40 * $400,000 = $160,000

This means the value of the functioning equipment is the total value minus the value of the faulty equipment:

$400,000 - $160,000 = $240,000

Therefore, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000."
"Mary has 30 sheep, and half of them produce 1 kg of milk each, while the other half produce 2 kg of milk each.

First, we calculate the number of sheep in each group:
- Half of 30 sheep is 15 sheep.

For the first half (15 sheep):
- Each sheep produces 1 kg of milk.
- So, 15 sheep * 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg of milk.

For the second half (15 sheep):
- Each sheep produces 2 kg of milk.
- So, 15 sheep * 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg of milk.

Now, we add the milk from both groups:
- 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg of milk.

Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day."

"To find out how many pupils like the color yellow, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pupils who like blue.
2. Determine the number of pupils remaining after those who like blue are accounted for.
3. Calculate the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils.
4. Subtract the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils to find out how many like yellow.

Let's start with step 1:
- Half of the class likes blue, so we calculate \( \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \) pupils like blue.

Now, step 2:
- After accounting for the 20 pupils who like blue, we have \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) pupils remaining.

For step 3:
- One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so we calculate \( \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \) pupils like green.

Finally, step 4:
- The rest of the pupils like yellow, so we subtract the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils: \( 20 - 5 = 15 \) pupils like yellow.

Therefore, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is 15."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of apples sold on Monday:**
   - Lucy got $56 from selling the apples on Monday.

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the interest for the five months. The interest rate is 10% per year, so for five months, the interest rate is:

\[ \text{Interest rate for 5 months} = \frac{10\% \times 5}{12} = \frac{10}{12}\% = \frac{10}{1200} = \frac{1}{120} \]

Now, we calculate the interest on the principal amount of $3,650:

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times \frac{1}{120} = 30.4167 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 30.4167 = 3680.4167 \]

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3680.4167}{5} = 736.08334 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:

\[ \boxed{736.08} \]"

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Cho hiked = 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 km

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Chloe hiked = 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 km

Now, we find the difference in the distances they hiked:
Difference = Distance Cho hiked - Distance Chloe hiked
Difference = 112 km - 45 km = 67 km

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos.

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, which means she has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, which means she has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos they have together:

- Total silver pesos: \(50 + 100 = 150\)
- Total gold pesos: \(80 + 120 = 200\)

The total number of pesos they have together is \(150 + 200 = 350\).

"First, let's determine the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She has 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, the total number of cups of lemonade is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how much revenue Millie will generate from selling all 36 cups of lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost of the supplies. Millie spent $18 on supplies. Therefore, her profit from selling all the lemonade is:

\[ \$36 \text{ (revenue)} - \$18 \text{ (cost)} = \$18 \]

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she sells all 36 cups, we need to determine how many hours it takes her to sell all the lemonade:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade:

\[ \frac{\$18 \text{ (profit)}}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

Therefore, the profit Millie makes per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he kept \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land. The amount of land he kept is given as 12.8 hectares.

So, we can write the equation as:
\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]
\[ x = 32 \]

Therefore, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.50 * 52 = 26

The choir decides to perform with just its female members, so initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform.

On the day of the performance, half of the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

Number of girls who can't make it = 0.50 * 26 = 13

So, the number of girls who actually perform is:

Number of girls who perform = 26 - 13 = 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them, so we add these 3 teachers to the number of girls performing:

Total number of people who sang in the performance = 13 (girls) + 3 (teachers) = 16

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

Therefore, the total number of messages James delivers is 88."
"To determine how much money David saves, let's break down the costs for both David and Dasha.

First, let's calculate the cost for Dasha:
- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost per ride for Dasha is \(2 \times 2 = $4\).
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \times 4 = $36\).

Now, let's calculate the cost for David:
- David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.
- Therefore, the total cost for David is $30.

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract the cost for David from the cost for Dasha:
- The savings for David is \(36 - 30 = $6\).

So, David saves $6."

"To solve this problem, we can use the given ratio and the total number of popsicles to find out how many popsicles each person has.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of popsicles is the sum of Betty's and Sam's popsicles:
\[5x + 6x = 165\]
\[11x = 165\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 11:
\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles.
- Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[90 - 75 = 15\]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services before the bundle discount:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu costs $10 a month.
- Disney Plus costs $10 a month.

So, the total cost for these three services before the discount is:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount for bundling:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we compare this to the cost of the cable package:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars per month (cable)} - 24 \text{ dollars per month (streaming)} = 36 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Therefore, Tim saves:
\[ \boxed{36} \text{ dollars per month} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time Carol spent on her work.

Carol spends 4 hours writing a song. Since she spends half that much time recording it, she spends \(4 \div 2 = 2\) hours recording. 

The time spent editing is given as 90 minutes. We need to convert this to hours to make the units consistent. \(90 \text{ minutes} = 90 \div 60 = 1.5 \text{ hours}\).

Now, let's add up all the time spent:
- Writing: 4 hours
- Recording: 2 hours
- Editing: 1.5 hours

Total time spent = \(4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5\) hours.

Next, we calculate the percentage of the total time spent editing. The time spent editing is 1.5 hours, and the total time is 7.5 hours. The percentage is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\%
\]

So, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, calculate the total number of spaces available in the shelving system. Since the system has 6 rows and 6 columns, the total number of spaces is:
   \[
   6 \times 6 = 36
   \]

2. Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in these spaces. Let's denote the number of books as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of books \( B \) is:
   \[
   B = 2 \times 36 + 20
   \]

3. Now, calculate the value of \( B \):
   \[
   B = 2 \times 36 + 20 = 72 + 20 = 92
   \]

So, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

"First, let's calculate the total number of Valentine's cards Erica initially had:

- Erica made 20 cards.
- Her dad brought 2 boxes with 15 cards each, so that's \(2 \times 15 = 30\) cards.

Adding these together, Erica initially had \(20 + 30 = 50\) cards.

Next, let's account for the cards she passed out and received:

- She passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
- She passed out 5 cards to her family.
- She received 17 cards from family and friends.

So, the total number of cards she gave away is \(24 + 5 = 29\).

Now, let's calculate the net change in the number of cards she has:

- She started with 50 cards.
- She gave away 29 cards.
- She received 17 cards.

The net change is \(50 - 29 + 17 = 38\).

Therefore, Erica now has \(\boxed{38}\) Valentine's Day cards."
"First, let's calculate how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Next, she gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices herself. So, we subtract the slices she eats from the total number of slices:
\[ 12 - 7 - 2 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the number of slices left is:
\[ 3 \]"
"To determine how many days Mark needs to save enough money to buy a bike that costs $300, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Mark needs to save: $300 (cost of the bike) - $50 (initial amount in the bank) = $250.
2. Determine how much money Mark earns per day: $10.
3. Calculate the number of days required to save $250: $250 / $10 = 25 days.

Therefore, Mark needs to save for 25 days to have enough money to buy the bike.

25 days"
"First, let's determine the number of millipedes Nancy saw. Since she saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, and she saw 90 spiders, the number of millipedes is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \]

Next, we need to find out how many stink bugs she saw. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \]

Now, we add up all the bugs she saw:

\[ 90 \text{ (spiders)} + 30 \text{ (millipedes)} + 48 \text{ (stink bugs)} = 168 \]

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is:

\[ \boxed{168} \]"
"To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine Beth's age.
2. Determine Alice's age.
3. Calculate the difference between Alice's and Erica's ages.

Given:
- Erica is 30 years old.
- Beth is 5 years older than Erica.
- Alice is 7 years older than Beth.

First, calculate Beth's age:
\[ \text{Beth's age} = \text{Erica's age} + 5 = 30 + 5 = 35 \]

Next, calculate Alice's age:
\[ \text{Alice's age} = \text{Beth's age} + 7 = 35 + 7 = 42 \]

Finally, calculate the difference between Alice's and Erica's ages:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Alice's age} - \text{Erica's age} = 42 - 30 = 12 \]

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 12 years."
"John drinks 2 glasses of milk, and each glass is 8 ounces. So, the total amount of milk he drinks is:

2 glasses * 8 ounces/glass = 16 ounces

16 ounces * 3 calories/ounce = 48 calories

Therefore, John consumed 48 calories."
"To calculate the builder's annual earnings, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of weeks the builder works in a month.
2. Calculate the number of days the builder works in a month.
3. Calculate the monthly earnings.
4. Multiply the monthly earnings by the number of months in a year to get the annual earnings.

Step 1: The builder works for 4 weeks every month.

Step 2: The builder works for 6 days every week. Therefore, in a month, the builder works for \(4 \text{ weeks/month} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ days/month}\).

Step 3: The builder gets paid $50 every day. Therefore, the monthly earnings are \(24 \text{ days/month} \times \$50/\text{day} = \$1200/\text{month}\).

Step 4: There are 12 months in a year. Therefore, the annual earnings are \(12 \text{ months/year} \times \$1200/\text{month} = \$14400/\text{year}\).

The builder earns \(\$14400\) in a year."
"To make a quadruple batch of brownies, Mark needs to multiply the quantities of each ingredient by 4.

For the flour:
- Normal recipe: 3 cups
- Quadruple batch: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups

For the milk:
- Normal recipe: 1 cup
- Quadruple batch: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, so:
- Number of bags needed: 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so:
- Number of bottles needed: 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy:
- Difference: 6 bags - 2 bottles = 4 more bags of flour

Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

"First, let's calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when it is used for 8 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. So, for 8 hours, the energy consumption is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the energy consumption to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Now, if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, the air conditioner will be used for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

The energy consumption for 3 hours is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

So, the total kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{135} \]"
"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

1. Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each:
   - Total stripes for these two zebras: \(2 \times 17 = 34\)

2. She also counts a zebra with 36 stripes:
   - Total stripes for this zebra: \(36\)

3. Another zebra has half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes:
   - Half of 36 is \(36 / 2 = 18\)
   - Total stripes for this zebra: \(18\)

Now, we add up all the stripes:
- Total stripes: \(34 + 36 + 18 = 88\)

Next, we count the number of zebras:
- Total number of zebras: \(2 + 1 + 1 = 4\)

To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
- Average number of stripes: \(88 / 4 = 22\)

Therefore, the average number of stripes on the zebras is 22."
"To determine how much money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sandwiches needed to serve 20 people.
2. Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.
3. Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of sandwiches needed.**
Each sandwich serves 4 people. Therefore, the number of sandwiches needed for 20 people is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.**
Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of meat and cheese needed is:
\[ 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of meat per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \]
\[ 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of cheese per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese.**
The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound, and the cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound. Therefore, the total cost for the meat and cheese is:
\[ 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \times \$7.00 \text{ per pound} = \$35.00 \]
\[ 5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \times \$3.00 \text{ per pound} = \$15.00 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$35.00 + \$15.00 = \$50.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is:
\[ \$50.00 \]"
"Allan initially has 40 cannolis. Since there is twice as much corn as cannolis, he has 2 * 40 = 80 corns.

After buying 60 more cannolis, he has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.

He also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, so he bought 100 - 40 = 60 corns.

Adding these to his initial amount of corns, he now has 80 + 60 = 140 corns.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100 + 140 = 240.

"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, let's break down the information given:

1. Elliott aims to walk 10,000 steps a day.
2. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. So, he walked 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.
3. He did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
4. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take.

First, let's calculate the total number of steps Elliott had taken before his jog:
- Steps from walking to and from school: 5,000
- Steps from the short walk with his friend: 1,000
- Total steps before the jog: 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000

Since he had 2,000 steps left to take after his jog, the total number of steps he aimed to take (10,000) minus the steps he had left (2,000) gives us the number of steps he took during his jog:
- Steps taken during the jog: 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000

However, since he had already taken 6,000 steps before his jog, the number of steps he took during his jog is:
- Steps taken during the jog: 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000

Therefore, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog."
"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:

Next, we need to determine how long it will take Toby to read the book at his reading rate:

9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport and it takes him 30 minutes to read the book. Additionally, it takes him 10 minutes to get to the airport:

60 minutes - 30 minutes (reading time) - 10 minutes (travel time) = 20 minutes

Therefore, Toby will be 20 minutes early. 

Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total payment for May.
2. Determine the number of employees remaining after June.
3. Calculate the total payment for June.
4. Sum the payments from May and June.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**

- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment for May = Number of employees × Hourly wage × Hours worked per week
Total payment for May = 40 × $15 × 40
Total payment for May = $24,000

**Step 2: Determine the number of employees remaining after June.**

- 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired in June.
- Number of employees who left = 1/4 × 40 = 10
- Number of employees remaining = 40 - 10 = 30

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for June.**

- Number of employees in June: 30
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment for June = Number of employees × Hourly wage × Hours worked per week
Total payment for June = 30 × $15 × 40
Total payment for June = $18,000

**Step 4: Sum the payments from May and June.**

Total payment for May and June = Total payment for May + Total payment for June
Total payment for May and June = $24,000 + $18,000
Total payment for May and June = $42,000

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $42,000."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. So, the first pound of taffy costs $3, and the second pound is half off, which means it costs $3 / 2 = $1.50. Therefore, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashell bag, which is $1.50.

Then, we calculate the cost of the 4 magnets, each costing $0.25. So, the total cost for the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Taffy: $4.50
- Seashell bag: $1.50
- Magnets: $1.00

Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

Sally started with $10.00. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is:
$10.00 - $7.00 = $3.00

Therefore, Sally has $3.00 left."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the second pack of fireworks. Since it's worth twice the amount of the first pack, we have:

\[ 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

Next, we add the cost of the first pack and the second pack to find the total cost before the discount:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Now, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the fireworks. A 20% discount means he pays 80% of the original cost:

\[ 1200 \times 0.80 = 960 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

So, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. To find out how many cookies she needs for 30 days, we multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of days:

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies she needs to make 60 cookies:

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozens

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

5 dozens"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the problem does not provide a direct percentage for candles that explode. Instead, it gives us a guarantee that the candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which implies that 1% of the candles might explode.

Given:
- Total candles made = 50,000
- Percentage of candles that might explode = 1%
- Percentage of candles that smell like wet dog = 5%
- We need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode.

First, calculate the number of candles that might explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles that might explode} = 50,000 \times \frac{1}{100} = 500 \]

Since the problem does not provide a specific percentage of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we can assume that the defect that makes the candles smell like wet dog is independent of the defect that makes them explode. Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode would be the product of the percentage of candles that smell like wet dog and the percentage of candles that might explode.

\[ \text{Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode} = 50,000 \times \frac{5}{100} \times \frac{1}{100} = 50,000 \times 0.05 \times 0.01 = 2.5 \]

Since the number of candles must be a whole number, we round 2.5 to the nearest whole number, which is 3.

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the discount price of each blouse. Since the blouses are 30% off, we subtract 30% from the regular price of $20.

30% of $20 is calculated as:
\[ 0.30 \times 20 = 6 \]

So, the discount is $6. Therefore, the discounted price of each blouse is:
\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost for the 4 blouses is:
\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples.
3. Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees, but we don't know the exact number yet. Let's call this number \(x\).

Joanne's total apples = \(30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\).

Joanne's sister gathers:
- Twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
- Three times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
- No apples from the average trees.

Joanne's sister's total apples = \(60 + 45 = 105\).

The combined total of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500 apples. So, we can set up the equation:
\[45 + x + 105 = 500\]

Simplifying the left side:
\[150 + x = 500\]

Subtract 150 from both sides to solve for \(x\):
\[x = 500 - 150\]
\[x = 350\]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

**350**"
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of heads is 180, which means \( C + D = 180 \).
2. The total number of bumps (humps) is 304, which means \( 2C + D = 304 \) because camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump.

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can express \( D \) from the first equation:
\[ D = 180 - C \]

Next, we substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[ 2C + (180 - C) = 304 \]
\[ 2C + 180 - C = 304 \]
\[ C + 180 = 304 \]
\[ C = 304 - 180 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we have \( C = 124 \), we can find \( D \):
\[ D = 180 - C \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days. He traveled 200 kilometers each day for 4 days, so the total distance for the first 4 days is:

\[ 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we need to find out how far he traveled over the next two days, which is 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days:

\[ 800 \, \text{km} \times 0.30 = 240 \, \text{km} \]

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is 0 km.

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, so the total distance for the second week is:

\[ 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we can add up all the distances to find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip:

\[ 800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} = 3140 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:

"Given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4.

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.

\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to determine the elevation of the comb and then calculate the difference between that elevation and Oliver's current elevation.

1. Stanley's comb fell 4,000 feet from his starting elevation of 10,000 feet.
   - Elevation of the comb = 10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet.

2. Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet.

3. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb:
   - Elevation difference = Elevation of the comb - Oliver's current elevation
   - Elevation difference = 6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet.

Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

"To determine how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money given by the second bank.
2. Add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital.

The first bank gave Mr. Josue $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so the amount from the second bank is:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Now, we add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, the total capital Mr. Josue has now is:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so the total number of cats carried away by the boats is:

4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats

After the boats carried away the cats, the number of cats left on the rock is:

50 cats - 20 cats = 30 cats

Then, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. The number of cats that ran after the mouse is:

(3/5) * 30 cats = 18 cats

So, the number of cats left on the rock is:

30 cats - 18 cats = 12 cats

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The problem states that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out the total savings Cole made. The problem states that he saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can set up the following equations:

Let \( S_{tattered} \) be the savings from the tattered jeans and \( S_{jogger} \) be the savings from the jogger jeans. We know:

\[ S_{tattered} + S_{jogger} = 6 \]
\[ S_{jogger} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
\[ S_{tattered} = 6 - 2 = 4 \]

The original price of the tattered jeans is $28, and Cole saved $4 on them, so the sale price of the tattered jeans is:

\[ 28 - 4 = 24 \]

The original price of the jogger jeans is $22, and Cole saved $2 on them, so the sale price of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 22 - 2 = 20 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:

\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans.

"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles.

First, we calculate the capacity of the 4 buses:
4 buses * 60 employees per bus = 240 employees

Next, we calculate the capacity of the 6 minibusses:
6 minibusses * 30 employees per minibus = 180 employees

Then, we calculate the capacity of the 10 minivans:
10 minivans * 15 employees per minivan = 150 employees

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles to get the total capacity:
240 employees (buses) + 180 employees (minibusses) + 150 employees (minivans) = 570 employees

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others, making a total of 6 bird feeders.

The store-bought bird feeders attract 20 birds each. Since the feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, her homemade feeders attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of birds attracted by the feeders:

- For the 3 store-bought feeders: 3 feeders * 20 birds/feeder = 60 birds
- For the 3 homemade feeders: 3 feeders * 30 birds/feeder = 90 birds

Adding these together, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is:

60 birds + 90 birds = 150 birds

150 birds"
"To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the bagel is given as $4.
2. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. So, the cost of the soup is:
   \[
   4 + (0.25 \times 4) = 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The cake costs half of the price of the bagel. So, the cost of the cake is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake:
\[
5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay \(\boxed{11}\) dollars for her dinner."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Kenny needs $100 to buy a ticket to the amusement park.
2. He plans to sell his cards for $1.5 each.
3. He keeps 1/3 of the cards and has $50 in spending cash after selling the rest.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

- He keeps 1/3 of the cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards.
- The money he gets from selling \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \) dollars.
- After keeping 1/3 of the cards and spending $50, he has $100 for the ticket.

So, the equation for the money he has after selling the cards and keeping some is:
\[ x - 50 = 100 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 100 + 50 \]
\[ x = 150 \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 150 cards."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The caterer was initially told to prepare enough hot dogs for 36 guests, with half of them getting two hot dogs. This means 18 guests would get two hot dogs, and the other 18 would get one hot dog.

2. The total number of hot dogs prepared would be:
   - 18 guests * 2 hot dogs = 36 hot dogs
   - 18 guests * 1 hot dog = 18 hot dogs
   - Total = 36 + 18 = 54 hot dogs

3. However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. This means that the first hot dog for each of the 40 guests was provided, and now they all want a second one.

4. Since the caterer only prepared 54 hot dogs, and 40 guests each want a second hot dog, we need to calculate how many of these second hot dogs can be provided:
   - 54 hot dogs - 40 hot dogs (first hot dog for each guest) = 14 hot dogs remaining

5. These 14 remaining hot dogs can be given as second hot dogs to 14 guests.

6. Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is:
   - 40 guests - 14 guests = 26 guests

Final numerical answer:
26 guests did not get a second hot dog."
"Indras' name has 6 letters.

Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3 letters.

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, so her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Therefore, the total number of letters in both names is 6 (Indras) + 7 (sister) = 13 letters.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Set of mixing bowls: $20.00
- 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Now, add these amounts together to get the total before the discount:

$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Next, calculate the discount. The items are 20% off, so we need to find 20% of $165.00:

20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Subtract the discount from the total to find the final cost:

$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

Therefore, the final cost of Charlotte's order is $132.00."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy:

- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, let's calculate how much money Dora has:

- Saved from allowance: $2
- Money given by her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, to find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the total money she has from the total cost of the items:

$19 - $18 = $1

Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

Dora needs $1 more."
"Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, which is:

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, which is:
\[ 2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ dragons} \]

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \text{ dragons} \]

Prince Bruce has slain 30 dragons."
"First, we need to determine how much gasoline is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needs in gallons. Josey needs \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons by 8:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"First, let's calculate how much money George had left after his purchase. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Money left} = 5 \times \frac{1}{100} = 0.05 \]

So, George spent:

\[ 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the 3 bags of chips:

\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars:

\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we divide the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar to find out how many he bought:

\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

**Final Answer: 5**"

\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

Now, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people to find out how many oranges each person will get:
\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, each person will get 7 oranges."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine will use. He doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. So, he will use:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the cost for the onions will be:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is on sale for $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock will be:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to find the total cost of the ingredients:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of Billie's room in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area of the room to find the width. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the room. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:

\[ \boxed{98 \text{ feet}} \]"
"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we first need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

For Elizabeth:
- Red beads: 1 pack * 20 beads/pack = 20 beads
- Clear beads: 2 packs * 20 beads/pack = 40 beads
- Total beads for Elizabeth: 20 + 40 = 60 beads

For Margareth:
- Blue beads: 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads
- Red beads: 4 packs * 20 beads/pack = 80 beads
- Total beads for Margareth: 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters:
- Margareth's beads - Elizabeth's beads = 140 - 60 = 80 beads

One sister has 80 more beads than the other.

"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time James took for the swim is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. So, the time James took for the bike is:
\[ 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( x \) be the time James took for the run. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, the total time for James is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

So, the time it took James to do the run is 59 minutes."
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is:

\[ 1.25 \times 60 = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so:

\[ \text{Length of Movie B} = 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, so:

\[ \text{Length of Movie A} = \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Movie A was 20 minutes long."
"First, let's determine how far the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the distance the horse runs is:
\[ 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate how much hay the horse eats. For every mile, the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse eats:
\[ 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails of hay} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost for 8 bails is:
\[ 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we subtract the cost of the hay from the amount of money Michael has:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the change Michael has after buying the hay is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has. She uses 4 dozen eggs and 2 additional eggs. Since a dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs equal 48 eggs. Adding the 2 additional eggs, she has a total of 50 eggs.

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Since each glass requires 5 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 5:

50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass = 10 glasses

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays she can put out:

10 glasses / 5 glasses per tray = 2 trays

Therefore, Rozanne can put out 2 trays of eggnog."
"To determine by how many points Joey is now winning, we need to calculate the total points for both Joey and Marcy after their respective turns and then find the difference between their scores.

First, let's calculate Joey's total points:
- Joey starts with 214 points.

- Therefore, Joey's total points are \(214 + 26 = 240\).

Next, let's calculate Marcy's total points:
- Marcy starts with 225 points.
- She scores an additional 10 points.
- Therefore, Marcy's total points are \(225 + 10 = 235\).

Now, we find the difference between Joey's and Marcy's total points to determine by how many points Joey is winning:
- Joey's total points: 240
- Marcy's total points: 235
- The difference is \(240 - 235 = 5\).

So, Joey is now winning by \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"To calculate the salesman's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per sneaker.
2. Calculate the total revenue from the flash sale.
3. Calculate the total revenue from the department store.
4. Calculate the total revenue.
5. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost per sneaker.**

The total cost for the case of sneakers is $576, and there are 48 sneakers in the case. So, the cost per sneaker is:
\[ \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from the flash sale.**

The salesman sold 17 sneakers at $20 each. So, the revenue from the flash sale is:
\[ \text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from the department store.**

The salesman sold the remaining sneakers (48 - 17 = 31) at $25 each. So, the revenue from the department store is:
\[ \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total revenue.**

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the revenue from the department store:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 5: Calculate the profit.**

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ \text{Profit} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the salesman's profit is:
\[ \boxed{539} \]"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Super Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $20
   - Popcorn with soda: $1 extra
   - Total cost with super ticket: $20 + $1 = $21

2. **Regular Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $12
   - Popcorn: Let's call the regular price of popcorn \( P \)
   - Soda: $3
   - Total cost without super ticket: $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \)

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - Therefore, the cost of the regular ticket option minus the cost of the super ticket option equals $2.
   - \( ($15 + P) - $21 = $2 \)

4. **Solve for \( P \):**
   - \( $15 + P - $21 = $2 \)
   - \( P - $6 = $2 \)
   - \( P = $2 + $6 \)
   - \( P = $8 \)

The regular price of the popcorn is $8.

"To find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the first day.
2. Calculate the new cost of filling one balloon after the price increase.
3. Calculate the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price.

**Step 1: Determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the first day.**

The total cost for 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon on the first day is:
\[ \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the new cost of filling one balloon after the price increase.**

The cost of each balloon increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is:
\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price.**

The total cost for 170 balloons at the new price is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 170 \times 65 = 11050 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase is:

"Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. 

First, let's calculate the value of the sapphires she trades:
3 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $2400

After the trade, she has 5 sapphires left:
5 sappires * $800/sapphire = $4000

The value of the 2 rubies she receives is:
2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $2400

Now, let's add the value of the remaining sapphires and the rubies:
$4000 (remaining sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $6400

"First, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed. The volume of a raised bed is given by its width, length, and height:

\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume of soil} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{\$/bag} = 1920 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, the potting soil will cost Bob $1920."
"First, let's calculate the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can find the number of green cards by calculating 60% of 15 and adding that to 15.

60% of 15 is:
\[ 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \]

So, the number of green cards is:
\[ 15 + 9 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find the number of yellow cards. The problem states that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards. So, we add the number of red cards (15) and green cards (24):

\[ 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards together:

\[ 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \]

Therefore, the total number of cards is:
\[ 78 \]"

"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

Therefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots."
"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to make, we first need to calculate the total weight of all the feed he is buying.

1. **Hay**: 42 bales at 75 pounds each
   \[
   42 \times 75 = 3150 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Oats**: 20 sacks at 65 pounds each
   \[
   20 \times 65 = 1300 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Carrots**: 4 bags at 12 pounds each
   \[
   4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Sugar cubes**: 2 boxes at 1 pound each
   \[
   2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Now, we add up all the weights:
\[
3150 + 1300 + 48 + 2 = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:
\[
\frac{4500}{2250} = 2
\]

Therefore, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."
"Grayson recycles 3 aluminum cans and 5 plastic bottles each week. 

For the aluminum cans:
3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week

For the plastic bottles:
5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week

Total earnings per week:
6 cents (from cans) + 15 cents (from bottles) = 21 cents/week

For a four-week month:
21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents

Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month."
"First, let's determine how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

\[ \text{Toni's plants} = \text{Frederick's plants} + 0.60 \times \text{Frederick's plants} \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 0.60 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 16 \]

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate the number of plants Shondra has as follows:

\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = \text{Toni's plants} - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 16 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 9 \]

Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants."

"To find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we first need to calculate the tip amount, which is 1/5 of the pizza order cost.

The cost of the pizza is $15.

The tip amount is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 15 = 3 \) dollars.

Now, we add the tip to the cost of the pizza to get the total amount:

Total amount = Cost of pizza + Tip
Total amount = $15 + $3
Total amount = $18

Therefore, the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man is $18."
"Let's break down Finley's position changes step by step:

1. She started in first place.
2. She fell back 5 spots: \(1 - 5 = -4\). Since she can't be in a negative spot, we adjust this to the last possible position, which is 100 (last place).
3. She then moved ahead 2 spots: \(100 + 2 = 98\).
4. She fell behind 3 spots: \(98 - 3 = 95\).
5. Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot: \(95 + 1 = 96\).

So, Finley finished in 96th place."
"First, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has:

\[ 6 \text{ decks} \times 25 \text{ cards/deck} = 150 \text{ basketball cards} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of baseball cards:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 40 \text{ cards/box} = 200 \text{ baseball cards} \]

Now, let's find the total number of cards she has:

\[ 150 \text{ basketball cards} + 200 \text{ baseball cards} = 350 \text{ cards} \]

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is:

\[ 350 \text{ cards} - 50 \text{ cards} = 300 \text{ cards} \]

If each student gets 10 cards, the number of students she has is:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ cards}}{10 \text{ cards/student}} = 30 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students."
"First, let's calculate how much Becky paid for her apples.

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.45 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

After receiving a $1 discount, Becky's final cost is:
\[ 9 - 1 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for her apples.

Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Kelly received a 10 percent discount on her total cost. The discount amount is:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, Kelly's final cost after the discount is:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky:
\[ 9 - 8 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Therefore, Kelly paid $1 more than Becky."
"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we need to calculate the number of each type of laundry item per room and then multiply by the number of rooms.

1. Each room has 2 sheets.
2. Each room has 1 comforter.
3. Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases.
4. Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 towels.

Now, let's sum up the total number of laundry items per room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforters: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

Total laundry items per room = 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15

For 80 rooms, the total number of laundry items is:
15 items/room * 80 rooms = 1200 items

Final numerical answer:
1200"
"Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes. 

- On Monday, he gets 5 pairs, which is 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.
- On Wednesday, he gains 15 pairs, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
- On Friday, he gains 30 pairs, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.
- On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes.

Let's calculate the total number of shoes he has by the end of Saturday:

Starting shoes: 200
+ Monday's gain: 10
+ Wednesday's gain: 30
+ Friday's gain: 60
- Saturday's loss: 180

200 + 10 + 30 + 60 - 180 = 120

So, by the end of Saturday, Fireman Frank will have 120 shoes."
"To find out how many pans worth of cupcakes Mary should bake, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cupcakes Mary can decorate with all her sprinkles.
2. Determine how many pans are needed to bake that many cupcakes.

First, we know that each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes, and Mary has 6 jars. So, the total number of cupcakes she can decorate is:
\[ 6 \text{ jars} \times 8 \text{ cupcakes/jar} = 48 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Next, we know that each pan holds 12 cupcakes. To find out how many pans are needed to bake 48 cupcakes, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold:
\[ 48 \text{ cupcakes} \div 12 \text{ cupcakes/pan} = 4 \text{ pans} \]

So, Mary should bake 4 pans worth of cupcakes."
"First, let's determine the cost of the piece of paper. The pen costs $2, and the paper costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen. 

Three times the price of the pen is:

"To solve this problem, we can break it down into a few steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pencils at the start:**
   - There are 30 students, and each student started with 10 pencils.
   - Total pencils = 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils.

2. **Determine the number of pencils used after two months:**
   - 1/5 of the total pencils were used.
   - Pencils used = 1/5 * 300 = 60 pencils.

3. **Calculate the number of pencils remaining after two months:**
   - Remaining pencils = Total pencils - Pencils used = 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.

4. **Determine the number of pencils left at the end of the year:**
   - At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left.
   - Pencils left = 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils.

Therefore, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is 80."
"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, so we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet to match the unit of the shark's body length. There are 12 inches in a foot.

Each remora is 6 inches long, which is \( \frac{6}{12} = 0.5 \) feet long.

Since there are 2 remoras, the combined length of the remoras is \( 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \) foot.

The shark's body length is 10 feet.

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length."
"Let's denote the total number of students at that grade level as \( x \).

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home. This means that one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers.

So, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{4}x = 20

"To find out how many kids in Gina's class are not allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to first determine how many kids are allergic to at least one of the substances (dairy or peanuts).

Let's denote:
- \( D \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( P \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

We are given:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

The number of kids allergic to at least one of the substances is given by:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

This means 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances. Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - |D \cup P| = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
20"
"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to add the number of employees to the number of tour guides.

First, calculate the total number of employees:
- There are 3 groups of 200 employees each.
- Total employees = 3 groups * 200 employees/group = 600 employees.

Next, calculate the total number of tour guides:
- Each group has 7 tour guides.
- Total tour guides = 3 groups * 7 tour guides/group = 21 tour guides.

Now, add the total number of employees and tour guides to get the total number of people going on the tour:
- Total people = Total employees + Total tour guides = 600 + 21 = 621.

Therefore, the total number of people going on this tour is 621."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel during the busy weekend. The normal price is $1500 per day, and it is 20% more expensive during the busy weekend.

20% of $1500 is:
\[ 0.20 \times 1500 = 300 \]

So, the cost of the hotel per day during the busy weekend is:
\[ 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, so for two people, it is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Adding the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel together gives the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

So, the total cost of the trip is:
\[ \boxed{15400} \]"

Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, which means:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ tubes of blue paint} \]

Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, which means:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ tubes of yellow paint} \]

To find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we add the tubes of blue and yellow paint together:
\[ 2 + 9 = 11 \]

Jasper has 11 tubes of paint."
"The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains. 

The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. So, we calculate the weight of the 2010 penny as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \text{ grains} = 36 \text{ grains} \]

Now, to find the combined weight of the two pennies, we add the weight of the 1959 penny and the 2010 penny:

\[ \text{Combined weight} = 48 \text{ grains} + 36 \text{ grains} = 84 \text{ grains} \]

The combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains."
"To find out how much more Keegan and Tashay need to earn to reach their goal, we first add the amounts they have already earned:

Keegan's earnings: $83
Tashay's earnings: $91

Total earned so far: $83 + $91 = $174

Their goal is to raise $200. To find out how much more they need to earn, we subtract the total earned from their goal:

$200 - $174 = $26

They need to earn $26 more to reach their goal."
"Gabriel has 20 songs on his player. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, which means Luri has \(3 \times 20 = 60\) songs on his player.

The maximum capacity of each player is 100 songs. Therefore, the number of songs Gabriel can still add to his player is \(100 - 20 = 80\) songs.

Similarly, the number of songs Luri can still add to his player is \(100 - 60 = 40\) songs.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add to his player than Gabriel can add to his, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:

\(80 - 40 = 40\)

Therefore, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his."
"First, we need to determine how many oranges Stetson ate. Since he ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 oranges they picked, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. Since he agreed to give $10 for each orange he eats, the total amount of money he gave up is:

\[
24 \times 10 = 240
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is $240."

First, calculate the total miles he runs in a week:
\[ 12 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 60 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, since he runs at a pace of 10 miles per hour, we can find out how many hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles by his speed:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, James runs a total of 6 hours a week."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the daily consumption of oats for one horse:**
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, the daily consumption for one horse is \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).

2. **Determine the daily consumption of oats for all four horses:**
   - Since there are four horses, the total daily consumption is \(10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).

3. **Determine the total consumption of oats for five days:**
   - The total consumption for five days is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).

4. **Determine the number of bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.
   - The number of bags needed is \(\frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags}\).

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days."
"First, we calculate the number of Pomeranians Jana has. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can find this number by calculating two thirds of 27:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 27 = 18
\]

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians.

Next, we need to find out how many of these Pomeranians are girls. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, so we calculate one third of 18:

The average highest temperature of these three countries is -10°F."
"To find out how many days it will take the child to save the remaining amount of money, we first need to calculate the remaining amount he needs to save.

The toy car costs $12, and the child already has $4 saved. So, the remaining amount he needs to save is:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

The child promises to save $2 daily from his allowance. To find out how many days it will take to save the remaining $8, we divide the remaining amount by the daily savings:

\[ 8 \div 2 = 4 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each tray can hold 24 eggs.
2. Jaime has 2 trays, so the total capacity of the trays is \(24 \times 2 = 48\) eggs.
3. Jaime has 64 eggs in total.

Now, we need to find out how many eggs won't be able to be placed on the tray. We do this by subtracting the total capacity of the trays from the total number of eggs:

\[64 - 48 = 16\]

So, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the tray."
"To find out how much Sally spends in all, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza and then add it to the cost of the small pizza.

1. The cost of the small pizza is $8.
2. The family-size pizza costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, so:
   \[ \text{Cost of family-size pizza} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

3. Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent:
   \[ \text{Total cost} = 8 + 24 = 32 \]

Sally spends a total of $32."
"First, let's calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors before any discounts. Each pack costs $4.00, so 2 packs would cost:

\[ 2 \times \$4.00 = \$8.00 \]

Since the razors are on sale with a ""buy one get one free"" offer, Heather only needs to pay for 1 pack to get the second one free. Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is the same as the cost of 1 pack:

\[ \$4.00 \]

Now, we apply the $2.00 coupon to the $4.00 cost:

\[ \$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00 \]

This $2.00 is the total cost for 2 packs of razors after the coupon. To find the cost per razor, we need to divide this total cost by the number of razors. Since there are 4 razors in each pack and she is buying 2 packs, she is getting 8 razors in total:

\[ 8 \text{ razors} \]

The cost per razor is:

\[ \frac{\$2.00}{8 \text{ razors}} = \$0.25 \text{ per razor} \]

Converting this to cents (since 1 dollar = 100 cents):

\[ \$0.25 = 25 \text{ cents} \]

So, the cost per individual razor, after the discount, is:

25 cents"
"To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to add the heights of the cheerleaders in the pyramid. The pyramid has 4 cheerleaders on the bottom, 3 on the next level, 2 on the next, and the shortest cheerleader (60 inches tall) at the top.

Since 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall. We can assume the 10th cheerleader is the shortest one, so she will be at the top of the pyramid.

The height of the pyramid is the sum of the heights of the cheerleaders in each level:

- Bottom level (4 cheerleaders): 4 * 64 inches
- Second level (3 cheerleaders): 3 * 64 inches
- Third level (2 cheerleaders): 2 * 64 inches
- Top level (1 cheerleader): 60 inches

Now, let's calculate the total height in inches:

\[ 4 \times 64 + 3 \times 64 + 2 \times 64 + 60 = 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches} \]

To convert the height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

\[ \frac{636}{12} = 53 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the human pyramid is 53 feet."
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour, and she works for 8 hours each day. So, each day she walks:

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be \(14 + 4 = 18\) years old.
3. At that time, Angela will be three times Brett's current age. Brett's current age is 14, so three times that is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

So, in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. To find out how old Angela is right now, we subtract 4 years from 42:

\[42 - 4 = 38\]

Angela is currently 38 years old.

**Angela is 38 years old.**"
"Paul drives his car twice a day for 14 days. 

For the morning rides, he spends $6 each day, so for 14 days, he spends:
\[ 6 \times 14 = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

For the afternoon rides, he spends $2 each day, so for 14 days, he spends:
\[ 2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the costs of the morning and afternoon rides together, we get:
\[ 84 + 28 = 112 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Paul spent a total of $112 on driving his car during these two weeks."
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, let's find the total number of oranges both brought together:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges, we can calculate the number of pies they can make by dividing the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, they can make 40 Greek orange pies."
"To find the number of guests at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests as \( x \).

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200 plus $5 per guest for food. So, the total cost for the first venue is:
\[ 200 + 5x \]

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per guest, and food is already included. So, the total cost for the second venue is:
\[ 25x \]

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the costs are equal. Therefore, we set the two expressions equal to each other:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( \boxed{10} \)."
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \(D\), by Lily as \(L\), and by Bodhi as \(B\).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \(L + D + B = 43\)
2. \(L = D + 7\)
3. \(D = \frac{1}{2}B\)

First, we can express \(B\) in terms of \(D\) using the third equation:
\[B = 2D\]

Now, we can substitute \(L\) and \(B\) in terms of \(D\) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]
\[ 4D = 36 \]
\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know \(D = 9\), we can find \(L\) and \(B\):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Lily found \(16\) insects.

Lily found 16 insects."
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the amount of yarn each of them used and then add those amounts together.

First, let's calculate the amount of yarn Mariah used:
Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, Mariah used:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the amount of yarn Mariah's grandma used:
Her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein of yarn. So, she used:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we add the amounts of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma:
\[ 91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, they used a total of 273 yards of yarn altogether."
"To find out how many gifts Cherrie bought in total, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Cherrie has 5 friends in total.
2. 2 of her friends want 5 gifts each.
3. The other 3 friends want 2 gifts each.
4. Cherrie decides to buy 10 more random gifts.

First, calculate the total number of gifts for the 2 friends who want 5 gifts each:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, calculate the total number of gifts for the 3 friends who want 2 gifts each:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, add the gifts for all 5 friends:
\[ 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Finally, add the 10 random gifts:
\[ 16 + 10 = 26 \]

So, Cherrie bought a total of 26 gifts."
"Given that the chair is 3 feet wide, and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, we can determine the width of the rug as follows:

Width of the rug = Width of the chair + 5 feet
Width of the rug = 3 feet + 5 feet
Width of the rug = 8 feet

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. So, we calculate the length of the couch as:

Length of the couch = 2 × Width of the rug + 2 feet
Length of the couch = 2 × 8 feet + 2 feet
Length of the couch = 16 feet + 2 feet
Length of the couch = 18 feet

Therefore, the couch is 18 feet long."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. Two of those packs are strawberry.
3. One pack is grape, which costs $2.
4. One pack is green apple, which costs half as much as the grape pack, so it costs $1.
5. The total cost of all the packs is $7.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

The total cost can be represented as:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

Each pack of strawberry gum costs $2."
"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, he should buy the cheapest lumber, which is the 2 x 4 piece of wood. Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks, and it costs $4.

Given that Frederick has $24 to spend, he can buy:

\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

pieces of 2 x 4 wood.

Since each piece of 2 x 4 wood provides 200 sticks, the total number of sticks he can make is:

\[ 6 \times 200 = 1200 \]

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make if he buys the cheapest lumber is:

1200"
"To determine the cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the price per pair of snowshoes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
- Each dog has 4 legs.
- Mario has 6 dogs.
- Total number of legs = 6 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 24 legs.

Step 2: Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
- Each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs.
- Number of pairs of snowshoes = 24 legs / 2 legs/pair = 12 pairs.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the price per pair of snowshoes.
- Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
- Total cost = 12 pairs * $12.00/pair = $144.00.

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $144.00."
"Janet takes two bus trips each day, and she does this five days a week. So, the total number of trips she makes in a week is:

2 trips/day * 5 days/week = 10 trips/week

The cost of each bus trip is $2.20. Therefore, the total cost of her bus trips for the week without a pass would be:

10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $22.00/week

If she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, the cost of her bus trips for the week would be $20.00.

To find out how much she would save by buying the weekly bus pass, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of the trips without the pass:

$22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00

So, Janet would save $2.00 by buying a weekly bus pass."
"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. 

The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, but the farm only has 30 cows, so this statement is not relevant to the actual number of cows on the farm.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals:

- The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 20 sheep.

Adding the animals from both the farm and the zoo:

40 (farm's animals) + 20 (zoo's sheep) = 60 animals.

The farm and zoo have a combined total of 60 animals."
"Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought, we can determine the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought by dividing the quantities Rose bought by 4.

For onions:
\[ \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

For potatoes:
\[ \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes at the market."
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 pounds.
2. Determine the number of days Andy has to achieve this goal.
3. Calculate the daily calorie deficit required.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of calories to burn**

Andy wants to lose 30 pounds, and it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 pound. Therefore, the total number of calories he needs to burn is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of days**

Today is December 31st, and Andy's birthday is July 19th. The number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July (up to the 19th): 19 days

Adding these up:
\[ 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190 \text{ days} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the daily calorie deficit**

To find out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day, we divide the total number of calories by the number of days:
\[ \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{190 \text{ days}} \approx 552.63 \text{ calories/day} \]

Therefore, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 553 calories to reach his goal."
"Gerald earns $30 every day. Since he worked for an entire week, he worked for 7 days. 

To find out how much he earned in total, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days he worked:
\[ 30 \times 7 = 210 \]

Gerald spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:
\[ 210 - 100 = 110 \]

Therefore, Gerald has $110 left."
"First, we need to calculate the total distance Hannah will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she runs 8 laps, we can find the total distance by multiplying the number of laps by the distance per lap:

\[ 8 \text{ laps} \times 0.25 \text{ km/lap} = 2 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to determine how much water Hannah needs to drink for the total distance. Since she needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs, we can find the total amount of water by multiplying the total distance by the amount of water per kilometer:

\[ 2 \text{ km} \times 60 \text{ ml/km} = 120 \text{ ml} \]

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water."
"Julie initially had $500.

First, she spent 20% of $500 on clothes:
20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

After buying clothes, she had:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs:
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

After buying CDs, she had:
$400 - $100 = $300

So, Julie had $300 left."
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost is $90,000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags that Tara bought.

Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, so the total number of bags is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ bags} \]

Each pack cost $4, so the total cost for all the bags is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the bags. Tara sold each bag for $8, so the total revenue is:
\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 320 - 32 = 288 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the profit Tara earned on her bags is:
\[ \boxed{288} \]"

1. Calculate the total time of the fight:
   - Each round lasts 3 minutes.
   - There are 5 rounds.
   - Total time = 3 minutes/round * 5 rounds = 15 minutes.

2. Calculate the total number of punches:
   - Joe throws 25 punches per minute.
   - Total time = 15 minutes.
   - Total punches = 25 punches/minute * 15 minutes = 375 punches.

Therefore, Joe threw 375 punches."
"Suzanne made 36 cookies. 

Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, so:
\[ \text{Cookies made by Josh} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9 \]

Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, so:
\[ \text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially.

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. So, the total amount from the $10 bills is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount from the $20 bills is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Ali has:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister. So, the amount given to his sister is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

The remaining amount after giving half to his sister is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount of money he has after buying dinner is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, let's convert Rob's time into minutes. Rob takes 2 hours, and since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Rob takes \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes to shingle a house.

According to the problem, Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes. So, we need to calculate double Rob's time and then add 40 minutes to it.

Double Rob's time is \(2 \times 120 = 240\) minutes.

Adding 40 minutes to this gives us \(240 + 40 = 280\) minutes.

Therefore, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house."
"To determine the total number of skeins of wool Martha needs, we first calculate the amount required for one grandchild and then multiply by three, as she is making the same items for each of her three grandchildren.

For one grandchild:
- Hat: 2 skeins
- Scarf: 4 skeins
- Sweater: 12 skeins
- Mittens: 1 skein
- Socks: 2 skeins

Total for one grandchild: 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 19 skeins

Since she has three grandchildren, we multiply the total by 3:
19 skeins/grandchild × 3 grandchildren = 57 skeins

Martha will need to buy 57 skeins of wool."

"First, let's determine the picking rate for each person:

- Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
- Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby picks \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
- Kathy picks twice as many as Bobby, so Kathy picks \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
- Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky picks \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, we add up the picking rates of all four individuals to find the total number of quarts they can pick per hour:

\[6 \text{ (Tony)} + 5 \text{ (Bobby)} + 10 \text{ (Kathy)} + 8 \text{ (Ricky)} = 29\]

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is 29."
"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakers had left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the total number of loaves baked.
2. Subtract the number of loaves sold in the morning.
3. Subtract the number of loaves sold in the afternoon.
4. Add the unsold loaves returned by the grocery store.

Let's do the math:

1. Total loaves baked: 200
2. Loaves sold in the morning: 93
3. Loaves sold in the afternoon: 39
4. Unsold loaves returned: 6

Now, calculate the remaining loaves:

200 (total baked) - 93 (morning sales) - 39 (afternoon sales) + 6 (returned) = 74

So, the bakers had 74 loaves of bread left."
"To determine the number of rows Jackson will plant, we need to calculate the number of rows for the red tulips and the blue tulips separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of rows for the red tulips:
- Jackson has 36 red tulips.
- He can fit 6 red tulips in a row.
- Therefore, the number of rows for the red tulips is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) rows.

Next, let's calculate the number of rows for the blue tulips:
- Jackson has 24 blue tulips.
- He can fit 8 blue tulips in a row.
- Therefore, the number of rows for the blue tulips is \( \frac{24}{8} = 3 \) rows.

Now, we add the number of rows for the red tulips and the blue tulips to find the total number of rows:
- Total number of rows = 6 (red) + 3 (blue) = 9 rows.

So, the final numerical answer is:
9 rows."
"To determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Divide the total amount of raisins equally among the three uses (oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix):**
   \[
   \text{Raisins per use} = \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups per use}
   \]

2. **Calculate how many batches of oatmeal cookies can be made with 9 cups of raisins:**
   \[
   \text{Batches of oatmeal cookies} = \frac{9 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cup per batch}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \text{ batches}
   \]

Therefore, Heather can make \(\boxed{12}\) batches of oatmeal cookies."
"First, let's calculate Ada's current weekly electric consumption and cost.

Ada's current daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. There are 24 hours in a day, so her daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh) is:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} = 288 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

To find her weekly consumption, we multiply by 7 days:
\[ 288 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 2016 \, \text{kWh/week} \]

At a rate of $1.50 per kWh, her weekly bill is:
\[ 2016 \, \text{kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$3024 \]

Next, let's calculate her new weekly consumption after adding the device.

The new device consumes 2 kWh per hour. So, her total daily consumption will be:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/hour} + 2 \, \text{kWh/hour} = 14 \, \text{kWh/hour} \]

Her new daily consumption in kWh is:
\[ 14 \, \text{kWh/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} = 336 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

Her new weekly consumption is:
\[ 336 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 2352 \, \text{kWh/week} \]

At the same rate of $1.50 per kWh, her new weekly bill is:
\[ 2352 \, \text{kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$3528 \]

Finally, the difference between her weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device is:
\[ \$3528 - \$3024 = \$504 \]

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is \$504."
"First, let's determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house (since 5 days for half a house means 10 days for a whole house).

Now, if one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, we can calculate the rate of painting per person per day. The rate is 1 house / 10 days = 0.1 houses per day.

If we have 5 people working together, their combined rate would be 5 * 0.1 houses per day = 0.5 houses per day.

To find out how many days it would take for 5 people to paint one whole house, we divide 1 house by their combined rate of 0.5 houses per day:

1 house / 0.5 houses per day = 2 days.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can calculate the total number of hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house:

2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"Ophelia has 20 sofas. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:

Ophelia's sofas: 20
Ophelia's chairs: 22
Jenna's sofas: 64
Jenna's chairs: 66

Total number of sofas: 20 + 64 = 84
Total number of chairs: 22 + 66 = 88

Total number of sofas and chairs: 84 + 88 = 172

172"
"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he didn't buy the headphone set, we first need to determine the cost of the headphone set.

1. We know that Tom paid a total of $48 for the CD and the headphone set.
2. The CD cost $4.
3. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set is $48 - $4 = $44.

Now, if Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have had the full $48 to spend on CDs.

4. Each CD costs $4.
5. To find out how many CDs he could buy with $48, we divide $48 by the cost of one CD: $48 / $4 = 12.

So, if Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have been able to buy 12 CDs.

Final numerical answer:
12"
"To find the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours.

First, let's calculate the total hours for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours. Since he worked out for 4 hours every week except for the weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours, and he worked out for 5 hours for two consecutive weeks and 6 hours for one week, we have:

- 5 weeks at 4 hours each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) hours
- 2 weeks at 5 hours each: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours
- 1 week at 6 hours: \(1 \times 6 = 6\) hours

Now, we add these amounts together to get the total number of hours:

\[20 + 10 + 6 = 36\]

So, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is 36 hours."
"Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.

At the first stop:
- 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers becomes \(48 - 8 = 40\).
- 5 times as many people as those who got off get on the bus, which is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) passengers.

So after the first stop, the number of passengers is \(40 + 40 = 80\).

At the second stop:
- 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers becomes \(80 - 21 = 59\).
- 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus, which means 1/3 of 21, so \(21 \div 3 = 7\) passengers get on.

So after the second stop, the number of passengers is \(59 + 7 = 66\).

Final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop: 66."
"First, let's determine Jame's current age. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, then his current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\).

Next, we need to find out how old Jame will be in 8 years. In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\).

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, we calculate twice Jame's age in 8 years and then subtract 5:

\[2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55\]

This means that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 55 years old. To find out Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55:

\[55 - 8 = 47\]

Now, we need to find the current age difference between Jame and his cousin. Jame is currently 22 years old, and his cousin is currently 47 years old. The age difference is:

\[47 - 22 = 25\]

So, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Given that the computer cost $1,100 and Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can determine the cost of the printer as follows:

Cost of the printer = Cost of the computer - $400
Cost of the printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of the printer = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, the printer, and the two monitors is $2,400. We can set up the equation to find the cost of the monitors:

Total cost = Cost of the computer + Cost of the printer + 2 * Cost of one monitor
$2,400 = $1,100 + $700 + 2 * Cost of one monitor

Simplifying the equation:

$2,400 = $1,800 + 2 * Cost of one monitor

Subtract $1,800 from both sides to isolate the term with the cost of the monitors:

$2,400 - $1,800 = 2 * Cost of one monitor
$600 = 2 * Cost of one monitor

Divide both sides by 2 to find the cost of one monitor:

Cost of one monitor = $600 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $300

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300."
"The boys brought back 60 shells each. According to the problem, the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. 

So, the number of seashells each girl brought is:

60 (shells brought by the boys) + 4 * 60 (four times the number of shells brought by the boys) = 60 + 240 = 300 seashells.

Each girl brought 300 seashells."
"George originally had 5 candies (since he ate 5 and now has 3 left). Nick had twice as many candies as George originally, so Nick had 2 * 5 = 10 candies.

"Chenny is 10 years old.

Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, so Alyana is:
10 - 4 = 6 years old.

Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so Anne is:
6 + 2 = 8 years old.

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old."
"The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 mm = 62 mm thick.

To find the total thickness of the four books, we add their individual thicknesses together:

31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma should make to complete her monthly goal, we first need to calculate how many vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

Adding these up: \(18 + 21 + 15 = 54\) vlogs.

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs per month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:

\(72 - 54 = 18\)

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month.

18"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The total bill is $50.
2. The tip is 20% of the total bill.
3. The tip amount is 20% of $50, which is \(0.20 \times 50 = 10\).
4. Since you are paying the full bill plus the tip, the total amount you end up paying is the bill plus the tip, which is \(50 + 10 = 60\).

So, you end up paying $60."
"First, let's determine how much each boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, each boy gets:

\[ \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The eldest boy then added $5 to his share:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

The following day, he added another $10:

\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

He then spent $8:

\[ 21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

After spending $8, he tripled the amount he had left:

\[ 13 \times 3 = 39 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount he has is:

\[ \boxed{39} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to break down the month of April into two halves and determine the daily savings for each half.

April has 30 days, so the first half consists of the first 15 days and the second half consists of the last 15 days.

Let's denote the daily savings in the first half as \( x \). Therefore, the total savings for the first half of the month would be \( 15x \).

According to the problem, Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half. So, the daily savings in the second half would be \( 2x \). The total savings for the second half of the month would be \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. Therefore, the sum of the savings from both halves of the month should equal $1125:

\[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 45:

\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} \]

\[ x = 25 \]

So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of the month. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he needs to save:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples, oranges, and peaches.

- The cost of the apples: \(3 \times \$1.50 = \$4.50\)
- The cost of the oranges: \(5 \times \$0.80 = \$4.00\)
- The cost of the peaches: \(6 \times \$0.75 = \$4.50\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost:

\(\$4.50 + \$4.00 + \$4.50 = \$13.00\)

Verna gave $20, so the change she received is:

\(\$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00\)

Therefore, the change Verna received is \(\$7.00\)."
"To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we need to calculate the total earnings for each and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate Jairus's total earnings:
- Jairus gets $0.8 for each task.
- He completed 20 tasks.

So, Jairus's total earnings = $0.8 × 20 = $16.

Next, let's calculate Jenny's total earnings:
- Jenny gets $0.5 for each task.
- She also completed 20 tasks.

So, Jenny's total earnings = $0.5 × 20 = $10.

Now, we find the difference between Jairus's and Jenny's earnings:
- Difference = Jairus's earnings - Jenny's earnings
- Difference = $16 - $10 = $6.

Therefore, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny."
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."
"Jeff walks to work and back home each day, which is a total of 3 miles to work and 3 miles back, making it 6 miles per day. If he works 5 times a week, then the total miles he walks in a week would be:

"Elise writes the full alphabet twice and half of it once. The English alphabet has 26 letters.

- Writing the full alphabet twice: \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters
- Writing half of the alphabet once: \(26 \div 2 = 13\) letters

After writing these, she re-writes everything she has already written. So, she re-writes \(52 + 13 = 65\) letters.

Therefore, the total number of letters Elise has written is:

\[
52 + 13 + 65 = 130

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. Each round of calls multiplies the number of families notified by 3.

1. In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.
2. In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 more families, so \(3 \times 3 = 9\) families are notified.
3. In the third round, each of the 9 families calls 3 more families, so \(9 \times 3 = 27\) families are notified.
4. In the fourth round, each of the 27 families calls 3 more families, so \(27 \times 3 = 81\) families are notified.

Therefore, during the fourth round of calls, 81 families will be notified.

"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost and then add that to his final weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight loss is:
\[ 10 \, \text{pounds/month} \times 3 \, \text{months} = 30 \, \text{pounds} \]

If his final weight was 70 pounds, then his initial weight was:
\[ 70 \, \text{pounds} + 30 \, \text{pounds} = 100 \, \text{pounds} \]

Therefore, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds."

1. First, we need to determine the total number of toys in a sorted play set that is five times larger than James's play set. Since James's play set has 80 toys, the sorted play set would have:
   \[ 80 \times 5 = 400 \text{ toys} \]

2. Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to have a total of 400 toys. Let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as \( x \). According to the problem, \( x + 2 = 400 \).

3. To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[ x + 2 = 400 \]
   \[ x = 400 - 2 \]
   \[ x = 398 \]

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Five notebooks at $1.50 each: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)
- Two pens at $0.25 each: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
- One calculator at $12 each: \(1 \times 12 = 12.00\)
- One geometry set at $10 each: \(1 \times 10 = 10.00\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:

\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00\]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:

\[30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Daniel has to spend:

\[30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00\]

Daniel has to spend $27.00 on all the items he wants to buy."

- Ten packs of potato fries at $0.30 each: \(10 \times 0.30 = 3\) dollars
- Five cans of fruit drinks at $2 each: \(5 \times 2 = 10\) dollars

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost:

\[20 + 3 + 10 = 33\] dollars

Carly gives a fifty-dollar bill, so we need to find the change she gets back:

\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars

Therefore, the change Carly gets back is 17 dollars."
"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned, we need to break down her sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the amount over $1000.

1. For the first $1000, she earns a 30% commission:
   \[
   1000 \times 0.30 = 300
   \]

2. For the sales over $1000, which in this case is $2500 - $1000 = $1500, she earns an additional 10% commission:
   \[
   1500 \times 0.10 = 150

Therefore, Antonella earned $450."
"First, let's calculate the total number of water bottles Bill already has:

He has 2 cases of water, with each case containing 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he has is:
\[ 2 \times 24 = 48 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles he needs for his guests. He has 70 guests and wants to provide 2 bottles per guest. So, the total number of bottles needed for the guests is:
\[ 70 \times 2 = 140 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we need to find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy. We subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles needed:
\[ 140 - 48 = 92 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Bill needs to buy an additional \(\boxed{92}\) bottles of water."
"When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does in cold water. So, twice the time it takes him in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes. Adding 2 minutes to that, he takes \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

To find out how much longer it takes him to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day, we calculate the total time for 3 miles in both conditions.

In cold water, for 3 miles, he takes \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes.

In warm water, for 3 miles, he takes \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes.

The difference in time is \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."
"To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings first.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day. So, his daily earnings are:

Therefore, the total cost of your lunch today at Subway is $160."
"To find the total number of holes in all the buttons, we need to calculate the holes from the buttons with two holes and the buttons with four holes separately, and then add them together.

First, we know that there are 7 buttons with 2 holes each. So, the total number of holes from these buttons is:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

Next, we need to find out how many buttons have 4 holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have 2 holes, the remaining buttons are:
\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \]

These 14 buttons each have 4 holes, so the total number of holes from these buttons is:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

"First, let's determine the weight of each person:

1. Mark weighs 150 pounds.
2. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan's weight is \(150 - 20 = 130\) pounds.
3. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob's weight is \(2 \times 130 = 260\) pounds.

Now, to find the average weight of the three friends, we add their weights together and divide by 3:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the movement of the sun relative to the pyramid and how this affects the angle from the ground to the sun.

1. The initial angle of the pyramid from the ground is 32 degrees.
2. The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which means the initial angle from the ground to the sun is also 32 degrees.
3. The sun moves 5 degrees an hour straight upward. Over 10 hours, the sun will move \(5 \times 10 = 50\) degrees upward.
4. Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid (32 degrees from the ground), after 10 hours, the angle from the ground to the sun will be the initial angle plus the upward movement: \(32 + 50 = 82\) degrees.

Therefore, the final angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is 82 degrees."
"First, let's determine the ages of James's sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, so the other son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out how many candles James needs. Since each son needs one candle per year, James needs 12 candles for the older son and 8 candles for the younger son. In total, he needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Now, we need to figure out how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Each pack contains 5 candles, so we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: 20 / 5 = 4 packs.

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pack costs $3, so for 4 packs, the total cost is 4 * $3 = $12.

James spends $12 on candles."
"First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night and there are 7 nights in a week, the total reading time in the first week is:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Given that she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she read per minute by dividing 2 pages by 1.5 minutes:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages she read in the first week by multiplying the total reading time by the reading rate:

\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages she read in two weeks is:

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( 44 + 7 = 51 \) years.

Let's denote the nephew's age in 7 years as \( N + 7 \).

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age:
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Now, we solve for \( N \):
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]
\[ N = \frac{30}{3} \]
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"Let's break down the payments step by step:

1. For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 per tooth. So, for three teeth, that's 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. So, for two teeth, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all the amounts:

$5.00 (first tooth) + $3.00 (next three teeth) + $1.00 (last two teeth) = $9.00

The tooth fairy left Sharon a total of $9.00."
"Given that Richie scored 80 goals, and he scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can determine the number of goals Mark scored as follows:

\[ \text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Next, since Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, we can determine the number of goals Anna scored as follows:

\[ \text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:

\[ \text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} \]
\[ \text{Total goals} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

Therefore, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is 175."

"First, let's calculate how much Peter spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spends an equal amount each day and there are 4 days (Sunday through Wednesday), we can divide his total money by 7 and then multiply by 4 to find out how much he spends on wooden action figures.

Total money: $70
Days in a week: 7
Cost of wooden action figures: $5 each

Amount spent on wooden action figures:
\[ \frac{70}{7} \times 4 = 10 \times 4 = 40 \]

Now, we know he spends $40 on wooden action figures. Let's find out how many wooden action figures he can buy:
\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, Peter buys 8 wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday.

Next, we need to find out how much money he has left after buying the wooden action figures:
\[ 70 - 40 = 30 \]

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. Let's calculate how many plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining $30:
\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

So, Peter buys 15 plastic action figures from Thursday through Saturday.

Finally, we add the number of wooden and plastic action figures to find the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week:
\[ 8 + 15 = 23 \]

Therefore, Peter will have a total of 23 action figures by the end of the week."

After 2 years, Katina will have \(\$600\) remaining in her savings account."
"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total cost and the total revenue, then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

1. **Calculate the cost of bread:**
   - Each loaf of bread costs $3.00 and makes 10 sandwiches.
   - Therefore, the cost of bread per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30.

2. **Calculate the total cost of bread for 10 sandwiches:**
   - Since 10 sandwiches require 1 loaf of bread, the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00.

3. **Calculate the total cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches:**
   - The cost is $30.00 for 10 sandwiches.

4. **Calculate the total cost for 10 sandwiches:**
   - Total cost = Cost of bread + Cost of cheese and condiments
   - Total cost = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

5. **Calculate the total revenue for 10 sandwiches:**
   - They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.
   - Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00 = $70.00

6. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

**Final numerical answer:**
$37.00"
"First, let's calculate the total number of crayons Kate has:

- She has 3 boxes of crayons.
- Each box contains 64 crayons.

So, the total number of crayons is:
\[ 3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ crayons} \]

Next, we need to determine how many crayon muffins she can make. Since she uses 8 small pieces of crayon for each muffin, we divide the total number of crayons by 8:

\[ \frac{192}{8} = 24 \text{ muffins} \]

Now, if she sells each muffin for $1.50, the total amount of money she can make is:

\[ 24 \times 1.50 = 36 \]

Therefore, Kate can make $36."
"To calculate the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet, we need to consider the cost of the carpet itself, the padding, the removal of the old carpet, and the installation of the new carpet. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the area of the bedroom:**
   \[
   \text{Area} = 18 \, \text{feet} \times 12 \, \text{feet} = 216 \, \text{square feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the carpet:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of carpet} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \times \$12/\text{square foot} = \$2592
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the padding:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of padding} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \times \$2/\text{square foot} = \$432
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of removal} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \times \$4/\text{square foot} = \$864
   \]

5. **Calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of installation} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \times \$34/\text{square foot} = \$7344

The total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is **$11232**."
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day, we first need to calculate the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

1. Total birds seen on days one and two: 50
2. Birds seen on day three: 0
3. Total birds seen on days four and five: 120
4. Birds seen on day six: 20
5. Birds seen on day seven: 90

Now, let's add these numbers together to get the total number of birds seen over the week:

\[ 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 \]

Next, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days (7) to find the average:

\[ \frac{280}{7} = 40 \]

So, on average, Mack saw 40 birds per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Diane starts with a number, which is 20.
2. She adds half of this number to it: \(20 + \frac{20}{2} = 20 + 10 = 30\).
3. She then divides this result by 5: \(\frac{30}{5} = 6\).
4. Finally, she multiplies this result by the starting value minus 12: \(6 \times (20 - 12) = 6 \times 8 = 48\).

So, the final value of the number train is 48."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees.

First, let's calculate the percentage error in the temperature setting:

\[ \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Temperature} - \text{Set Temperature}}{\text{Set Temperature}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Error} = 0.04 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Error} = 4\% \]

Now, we know the oven is 4% too hot. To find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to set the oven to a temperature that is 4% lower than 520 degrees.

Let \( T \) be the temperature Maggie should set her oven to. The relationship can be expressed as:

\[ T = 520 \times (1 - 0.04) \]
\[ T = 520 \times 0.96 \]
\[ T = 499.2 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 499.2 degrees."
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, the first movie is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours into minutes gives:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]
Adding the 5 minutes gives:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 125 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the durations of the two movies together:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 125 \text{ minutes} = 215 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate 30% of the price of Herb's house and then subtract that from the price of Herb's house.

1. Calculate 30% of $76,000:
\[ 30\% \times 76,000 = 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

2. Subtract that amount from the price of Herb's house to find the price of Juan's house:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

3. Now, add the value of both houses to find the combined value:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy brought, which means her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups brought by both Judy and her friend is 12 + 40 = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes brought by both is 24 + 44 = 68 dishes.

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two is 52 + 68 = 120.

"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount. 

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 single use contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per contact when buying 2 boxes is:
\[ \boxed{1.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours worked by Jill and John.

Jill worked:
- 2 hours on Saturday
- 1 hour on Sunday
Total hours for Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

John worked:
- Twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday
- Three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday
Total hours for John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours

Now, let's calculate the earnings for each.

Jill's earnings:
- $10 per hour * 3 hours = $30

John's earnings:
- $10 per hour * 7 hours = $70

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:
- John's earnings - Jill's earnings = $70 - $30 = $40

John earned $40 more than Jill.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
$40"
"First, let's calculate the total calories Hannah burns from aerobics and running.

- Aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
- Running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Now, we know that Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. So, we can calculate the total amount of water she needs to drink as follows:

Total water needed = (Total calories burned / 200 calories) * 100 ml
Total water needed = (1600 calories / 200 calories) * 100 ml
Total water needed = 8 * 100 ml
Total water needed = 800 ml

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the note on the jar, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans.

So, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) can be expressed as:
\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]

And the number of green jelly beans \( G \) can be expressed as:
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500, so we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]
\[ 3B = 4500 \]
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."
"To find the average of the three measurements, we first need to determine the typing speeds at each of the three points in time.

1. Initial typing speed: 47 WPM
2. After lessons: 52 WPM
3. After further increase: 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Now, we add these three speeds together and then divide by the number of measurements (which is 3) to find the average.

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{156}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average} = 52 \]

The average of the three measurements is 52 WPM."
"To find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and donuts for breakfast, we need to calculate the weight change for each option over the 5-week period and then find the difference between these changes.

1. **Cheerios:**
   - Weight loss per week: 1.25 pounds
   - Over 5 weeks: \(1.25 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 6.25 \, \text{pounds}\)

3. **Difference in weight change:**
   - Weight change with donuts: +8.75 pounds
   - Weight change with Cheerios: -6.25 pounds
   - Difference: \(8.75 \, \text{pounds} - (-6.25 \, \text{pounds}) = 8.75 \, \text{pounds} + 6.25 \, \text{pounds} = 15 \, \text{pounds}\)

The difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating donuts and Cheerios for breakfast is 15 pounds."
"To determine the total number of seats Alex will need, we need to account for all the people who will be attending the event.

1. Alex initially invites 100 people via email.
2. Each of these 100 people will also invite 2 friends. So, the number of additional people invited by email invites is \(100 \times 2 = 200\).
3. Alex also calls 10 of her friends and invites them. So, there are 10 more people invited this way.
4. Out of these 10 friends, 8 will bring their spouses. So, there are 8 additional people (spouses) coming.

Now, let's sum up all the attendees:
- Initial email invites: 100
- Additional people from email invites: 200
- Friends invited by phone: 10
- Spouses: 8

Total number of seats needed = \(100 + 200 + 10 + 8 = 318\).

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats."

"To determine how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we need to calculate the total cost for each platform and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the boots on Amazon:
- Cost of boots: $16
- Shipping cost: $4
- Total cost on Amazon: $16 + $4 = $20

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the boots on eBay:
- Cost of boots: $13
- Shipping cost: Twice the cost of Amazon's shipping, so $4 * 2 = $8
- Total cost on eBay: $13 + $8 = $21

Now, we find the difference in total cost between eBay and Amazon:
- Total cost on eBay: $21
- Total cost on Amazon: $20
- Difference: $21 - $20 = $1

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the weekly protein intake based on daily consumption.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, 200 grams (which is double the amount) would contain double the protein:

\[ 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} \times \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

So, John gets 6 grams of protein from 200 grams of mushrooms each day.

Next, to find out how much protein he gets in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ 6 \text{ grams of protein/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein/week} \]

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms daily."
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
Subtract \( 2J \) from both sides:
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
Multiply both sides by -1:
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

1. The base price for 2 implants is $2000 each, so for 2 implants, it's:
   \[2 \times 2000 = 4000\]

2. For one of the implants, there's an extra cost for a porcelain crown, which is $500. So, the total cost for the dental work is:
   \[4000 + 500 = 4500\]

3. George has already put down a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
   \[4500 - 600 = 3900\]

4. George makes $15 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
   \[3900 \div 15 = 260\]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:

\[ x = 30 \]

Now, we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Colby has in each type of coin:

- Nickels: 14 nickels × $0.05 = $0.70
- Pennies: 15 pennies × $0.01 = $0.15

Now, let's add up all the money Colby has:

$2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45

Since each gumball costs a nickel ($0.05), we can find out how many gumballs Colby can buy by dividing the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:

$3.45 ÷ $0.05 = 69

Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"To find the total number of legs the pets in the store have, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

- Dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- Cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- Birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:

\(20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}\)

Therefore, the total number of legs the pets in the store have is 48."
"Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He increases the weight by 50%, so the new weight is:

\[ 8 \text{ pounds} + (0.50 \times 8 \text{ pounds}) = 8 \text{ pounds} + 4 \text{ pounds} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, he uses a weight that is two pounds lighter than 12 pounds, so the final weight he uses is:

\[ 12 \text{ pounds} - 2 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

The weight that he now uses is 10 pounds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Games**: Steve gets 5 games for his birthday.
2. **First Year**: He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so he buys 12 games.
3. **Second Year**: He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so he buys 24 games.
4. **Third Year**: He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, so he buys 48 games.
5. **Christmas Gifts**: He gets 5 games every year for 3 years, so he gets 15 games in total.

Now, let's add all these up:

- Initial games: 5
- First year: 12

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The speed is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken.

Given:
- Distance traveled = 1200 miles
- Time taken = 3 hours

Speed of the plane = Distance / Time = 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per hour.

Now, we need to find out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same speed.

Time = Distance / Speed = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour = 5 hours.

Therefore, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate.

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolate Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds of chocolate Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds as Ruiz in an hour:

\[ 60 \times \frac{3}{4} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we find out how many pounds of chocolate Ruiz and Marissa can make together in one hour:

\[ 60 + 45 = 105 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Since they worked for 12 hours in a day, we multiply the total amount they can make in one hour by 12:

\[ 105 \times 12 = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together in 12 hours is:

\[ 1260 \text{ pounds} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Howard spends each day and then subtract the total from his original amount of $100.

3. On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as on Tuesday, which is \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, let's add up the total amount spent over the three days:
\[ 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \]

Howard originally had $100. After spending $88, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 100 - 88 = 12 \]

Therefore, Howard has $12 left."
"To find out how much money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the earnings from each period separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Therefore, in one hour, he earned \(15 \times 0.50 = 7.50\) dollars.
- Over four hours, he earned \(4 \times 7.50 = 30\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Therefore, in one hour, he earned \(10 \times 0.60 = 6.00\) dollars.
- Over two hours, he earned \(2 \times 6.00 = 12\) dollars.

Now, we sum the earnings from both periods:
- Total earnings = \(30 + 12 = 42\) dollars.

Therefore, Patrick earned a total of \(42\) dollars from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations per month.
2. Calculate the total number of rotations per year.
3. Determine how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations per month.**

Given that the car drives 2 miles and the tires rotate 725 times, we can find the number of rotations per mile by dividing the number of rotations by the number of miles:
\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725}{2} = 362.5 \]

Now, we can find the total number of rotations per month by multiplying the rotations per mile by the number of miles driven per month:
\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 362.5 \times 400 = 145,000 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of rotations per year.**

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find the total number of rotations per year by multiplying the rotations per month by 12:
\[ \text{Rotations per year} = 145,000 \times 12 = 1,740,000 \]

**Step 3: Determine how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.**

To find out how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations, we divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the number of rotations per year:
\[ \text{Years before replacement} = \frac{10,440,000}{1,740,000} = 6 \]

Therefore, the tire will need to be replaced in \(\boxed{6}\) years."
"To find the cost per pump, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of washings per bottle.
2. Calculate the number of washings per pump.
3. Find the cost per washing.
4. Determine the cost per pump.

Given:
- The bottle costs $24.00.
- 2 pumps give 120 washings.

First, we find the number of washings per pump:
- If 2 pumps give 120 washings, then 1 pump gives \( \frac{120}{2} = 60 \) washings.

Next, we find the cost per washing:
- The total cost of the bottle is $24.00, which is 2400 cents.
- The cost per washing is \( \frac{2400 \text{ cents}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 20 \text{ cents per washing} \).

Finally, we find the cost per pump:
- Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost per pump is \( 60 \text{ washings} \times 20 \text{ cents per washing} = 1200 \text{ cents} \).

So, the cost per pump is 1200 cents."
"First, let's calculate the discount on the items Joe wants to buy.

The shirt originally costs $25, and there is a 30% discount on it. To find the discount amount, we calculate 30% of $25:
\[ 0.30 \times 25 = 7.50 \]

So, the shirt will cost Joe:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

Next, the shorts cost $35, and there is no discount mentioned for the shorts. So, the shorts will cost Joe $35.

Now, let's add the cost of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost before tax:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

However, Joe only has $50, and the total cost before tax is $52.50. Since the total cost exceeds the amount Joe has, he cannot make the purchase with the given budget. Therefore, he will not have any money left after the purchase because he cannot afford it.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \text{Joe will not have any money left after the purchase.} \]"
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the amount of butter needed for the total number of dozens of croissants.

First, Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days. So, the total number of dozens of croissants he will make in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we know that it takes \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, for 28 dozen croissants, the amount of butter needed is:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make these croissants."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we first need to calculate the cost of repaving each street.

1. Calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:
   - Cost per meter = $194
   - Length of Monica's street = 150 meters
   - Cost for Monica's street = $194 * 150 = $29,100

2. Calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:
   - Cost per meter = $194
   - Length of Lewis' street = 490 meters
   - Cost for Lewis' street = $194 * 490 = $95,060

3. Find the difference in cost between Lewis' street and Monica's street:
   - Difference in cost = Cost for Lewis' street - Cost for Monica's street
   - Difference in cost = $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

The final numerical answer is:
$65,960"
"John's initial funding for the first 5 months is $100,000. The research took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, which means the total research duration is 50 months (5 initial months + 45 additional months).

For the first 5 months, the cost is $100,000.

For the next 45 months, the cost per month is 50% more than the initial $100,000. So, the cost per month for these months is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000.

The total cost for the next 45 months is $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

Adding the initial 5 months' cost to the cost of the next 45 months, the total cost of the research is $100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is $6,850,000."
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to add up the ounces of meat each player ate.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these together:
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days in March.
2. Calculate the total number of posts per day for the entire group.
3. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in March.

March typically has 31 days.

Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day. With 1000 members, the total number of posts per day for the group is:
\[ 1000 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ posts/member/day} = 3000 \text{ posts/day} \]

Now, to find the total number of posts in March:
\[ 3000 \text{ posts/day} \times 31 \text{ days} = 93000 \text{ posts} \]

So, the total number of posts that the group will have in March is:
\[ 93000 \]"
"Gary does laundry twice a week, so in a year (52 weeks), he does laundry 52 * 2 = 104 times.

Each load uses 20 gallons of water, so for 104 loads, he uses 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons of water.

A gallon of water costs $0.15, so for 2080 gallons, he spends 2080 * $0.15 = $312.

Therefore, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year."
"To find out how much Scarlett spent in total, we need to add up the costs of all the items she bought.

1. Aquarium: $10.00
2. Rocks: 2 bags at $2.50 each = 2 * $2.50 = $5.00
3. Coral: 3 pieces at $2.00 each = 3 * $2.00 = $6.00
4. Fish: 20 fish at $0.50 each = 20 * $0.50 = $10.00
5. Fish food: $2.00

Now, we add all these amounts together:

$10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00

So, Scarlett spent a total of $33.00."

Therefore, after 3 weeks, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall."
"To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of meat from the bull.
2. Determine how much meat Prince sells in one day.
3. Calculate the number of days required to sell all the meat.

First, the total amount of meat from the bull is 750kg.

Next, Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day. Therefore, the amount of meat he sells in one day is:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Now, to find out how many days it will take Prince to sell 750kg of meat, we divide the total amount of meat by the amount he sells per day:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

"First, let's calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, so the total number of seats is:

\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \]

Next, we need to find out how many seats were occupied by the administrators. Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \]

Now, we subtract the number of seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats to find out how many seats were left:

\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \]

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

The rest of the seats were occupied by the students. To find out how many seats were occupied by the students, we subtract the number of seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats:

\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is:

\[ 36 \]"

"To find out how many total times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to calculate the remaining play times for each DVD and then sum them up.

For the first DVD:
- It can be played 1000 times before it breaks.
- It has already been played 356 times.
- Remaining play times = 1000 - 356 = 644 times.

For the second DVD:
- It can be played 1000 times before it breaks.
- It has already been played 135 times.
- Remaining play times = 1000 - 135 = 865 times.

Now, we add the remaining play times of both DVDs:
- Total remaining play times = 644 + 865 = 1509 times.

Therefore, both DVDs can be played a total of 1509 times before they break."
"To find the total cost of John's physical therapy, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours John spent in physical therapy.
2. Multiply the total number of hours by the cost per hour.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours:

- John went to physical therapy twice a week.
- Each session is 2 hours long.
- He went for 6 weeks.

So, the total number of hours per week is:
\[ 2 \text{ sessions/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/session} = 4 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, for 6 weeks, the total number of hours is:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Pack of Gum**: Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.

2. **Gum Chewing at School**: He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours per piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, after school, he has:
   \[
   20 - 4 = 16 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Gum Chewing on the Way Home and After Dinner**: He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so he chews:
   \[
   1 + 1 = 2 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   After these, he has:
   \[
   16 - 2 = 14 \text{ pieces}

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb/s to Mb/s.
2. Convert the speed from Mb/s to Mb/h.

Step 1: Convert kb/s to Mb/s
Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we divide the speed in kb/s by 1000 to get the speed in Mb/s.
\[ \text{Speed in Mb/s} = \frac{20 \text{ kb/s}}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \]

Step 2: Convert Mb/s to Mb/h
There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply the speed in Mb/s by 3600 to get the speed in Mb/h.
\[ \text{Speed in Mb/h} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s/h} = 72 \text{ Mb/h} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. So, for those three days, the total number of cars towed is:

10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

For the remaining four days, it towed four fewer cars than the previous days, which means it towed:

10 cars/day - 4 cars/day = 6 cars/day

So, for the remaining four days, the total number of cars towed is:

6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Adding the number of cars towed in the first three days and the last four days gives us the total number of cars towed that week:

30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

Therefore, the total number of cars towed that week is 54."
"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.

First, let's convert Adam's current height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot:

\[ \text{Adam's current height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how much taller Adam needs to be to meet the 4 feet requirement:

\[ \text{Height difference} = 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:

\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, we can calculate the number of years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference:

\[ \text{Years required} = \frac{\frac{2}{3} \text{ feet}}{\frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year}} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.
2. Calculate the total cost to the company for acquiring the cars.
3. Determine the profit.
4. Calculate James's commission based on the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.**

James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost to the company for acquiring the cars.**

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
\[ \text{Cost per car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000 \]

**Step 3: Determine the profit.**

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

**Step 4: Calculate James's commission based on the profit.**

James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
\[ \text{Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

\[ 100 \text{ riders} \times 0.25 = 25 \text{ riders} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are men. Since 60% of the riders who stay upright are women, the remaining 40% must be men. So, we calculate:

\[ 25 \text{ riders} \times 0.40 = 10 \text{ men} \]

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can calculate the price of a gold jewel as follows:

Price of a gold jewel = \(\frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600\)

The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel, so:

Price of a silver jewel = \(1600 - 400 = 1200\)

Now, to find the total price for all three jewels, we add the prices together:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = \(2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800\)

The total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of each type of stamp together:

16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45 stamps.

Max bought 45 stamps in all."
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob. 

Bob is driving at 55 mph, and Tom is driving at 70 mph. The difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, we can find the time it takes for Tom to catch up by dividing the distance by the relative speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"Naomi caught 17 fish.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we first need to calculate the cost per class if he misses a certain number of classes.

1. The total cost for the classes is $60.
2. There are 10 total classes.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as \( x \). If he misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes.

The cost per class would then be:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of classes attended}} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need this cost to be no more than $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the inequality by \( 10 - x \) (assuming \( 10 - x > 0 \)):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 100 from both sides:
\[ 60 - 100 \leq -10x \]
\[ -40 \leq -10x \]

Dividing both sides by -10 (and reversing the inequality sign):
\[ 4 \geq x \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of customers each person processes in a week and then sum these numbers.

1. **Determine the number of customers Jewel processes in a week:**
   - Jewel processes 50 customers per day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, Jewel processes \(50 \times 7 = 350\) customers in a week.

2. **Determine the number of customers Julie processes in a week:**
   - Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel.
   - This means Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel in the same amount of time.
   - Therefore, Julie processes \(50 \times 2 = 100\) customers per day.
   - Over a week, Julie processes \(100 \times 7 = 700\) customers.

3. **Calculate the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel:**
   - Total weekly production = Jewel's weekly production + Julie's weekly production
   - Total weekly production = \(350 + 700 = 1050\)

**Final numerical answer:**

"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

1. **Cost of one apple:**
   - Four apples cost $5.20.
   - Therefore, the cost of one apple is \( \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of one orange:**
   - Three oranges cost $3.30.
   - Therefore, the cost of one orange is \( \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost for 5 apples:**
   - Since one apple costs $1.30, 5 apples will cost \( 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \) dollars.

4. **Total cost for 5 oranges:**
   - Since one orange costs $1.10, 5 oranges will cost \( 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \) dollars.

5. **Total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:**
   - Adding the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we get \( 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \) dollars.

Therefore, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, to find the total time \( T \) it will take him to dig the hole, we multiply the volume of the hole by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{216} \]"
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price of the truck to the cost of each of the additional features.

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so \( \frac{1}{3} \times 7500 = 2500 \) dollars
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so \( 2500 - 500 = 2000 \) dollars
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1500

Now, we add all these costs together:

\[ 30000 + 7500 + 2500 + 2000 + 1500 = 43500 \]

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"First, let's calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise:

\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$20000 + (0.05 \times \$20000) = \$20000 + \$1000 = \$21000 \]

Next, we add the bonus, which is half a month's salary:

\[ \text{Bonus} = \frac{1}{2} \times \$21000 = \$10500 \]

So, Tim's total monthly income after the raise and bonus is:

\[ \text{Total Monthly Income} = \$21000 + \$10500 = \$31500 \]

To find out how much Tim will make in a year, we multiply his total monthly income by 12:

\[ \text{Annual Income} = \$31500 \times 12 = \$378000 \]

Therefore, Tim will make \(\$378000\) in a year."
"To find the total cost of everything James bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of suits:**
   - James buys 10 suits.
   - Each suit costs $750.
   - Total cost for suits = 10 suits * $750/suit = $7500.

2. **Cost of dress pants:**
   - James buys 10 dress pants.
   - Each dress pant costs 1/5 the cost of a suit.
   - Cost of one dress pant = $750 / 5 = $150.
   - Total cost for dress pants = 10 dress pants * $150/dress pant = $1500.

3. **Cost of dress shirts:**
   - James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
   - He has 10 suits, so he buys 10 * 3 = 30 dress shirts.
   - Each dress shirt costs $60.
   - Total cost for dress shirts = 30 dress shirts * $60/dress shirt = $1800.

4. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of suits + Cost of dress pants + Cost of dress shirts.
   - Total cost = $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

The final numerical answer is:
$10800."
"To calculate the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of political and weather news articles published by the first website in February.
2. Calculate the total number of business news articles published by the second website in February.
3. Add the two totals together to get the combined total.

Step 1: The first website publishes 20 articles per day. Since February has 28 days, the total number of articles published by the first website is:
\[ 20 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 560 \text{ articles} \]

Step 2: The second website publishes 10 articles per day. For 28 days, the total number of articles published by the second website is:
\[ 10 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ articles} \]

Step 3: Adding the two totals together:

"Steve is 60 years old. His wife is 4 years older, so she is 64 years old. Their son is currently half as old as his mom, which means their son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old. Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so she is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

Steve's son's wife is 29 years old."
"To find the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount of flour in one bag.
2. Multiply that amount by three to find the total for three bags.

First, we know that one bag of flour is divided into 8 portions, each of 2 kilograms. So, the total amount of flour in one bag is:
\[ 8 \text{ portions} \times 2 \text{ kg/portion} = 16 \text{ kg} \]

Next, we need to find the total amount of flour in three bags:
\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 16 \text{ kg/bag} = 48 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is:

"To find the total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley, we first calculate the distance each person biked individually and then sum these distances.

For Alisa:
- Speed: 12 miles per hour
- Time: 4.5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles

For Stanley:
- Speed: 10 miles per hour
- Time: 2.5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances together to find the total miles biked:
- Total distance = Distance biked by Alisa + Distance biked by Stanley = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

Therefore, the total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To calculate the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to determine the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add these times together.

First, let's calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He has to dig 24 feet of soil.
- Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.

Next, let's calculate the time to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs half as fast through clay, which is 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour.
- He has to dig 8 feet of clay.
- Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

Now, we add the time to dig through the soil and the time to dig through the clay:
- Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

Therefore, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well."
"To determine the total number of cupcakes Howie should buy, we need to consider the number of people who will receive cupcakes and the type of cupcakes each person will get.

1. Howie is buying cupcakes for himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates. This makes a total of 27 people (1 + 1 + 25).

2. Each person will receive 2 cupcakes (one vanilla and one chocolate).

To find the total number of cupcakes, we multiply the number of people by the number of cupcakes each person will receive:

\[ 27 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ cupcakes/person} = 54 \text{ cupcakes} \]

So, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Fishio initially received 2000 likes on her photo.
2. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes. So, the number of likes after three weeks is \(2000 \times 70 = 140000\).
3. Recently, she received 20000 more new likes.

To find the total number of likes, we add the initial likes, the likes after three weeks, and the recent likes:

\[2000 + 140000 + 20000 = 162000\]

So, the total number of Instagram likes is 162000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost Clara paid for her pomegranates on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the voucher was:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She got a $2 discount, so the final amount she paid was:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost Sheila paid for her pomegranates on Wednesday.

The price per pomegranate on Wednesday was $30, so the total cost before the discount was:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

Sheila got a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount was:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final amount she paid was:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \text{ dollars} \]

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
\[ \boxed{142} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Ariadne's sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
2. The sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats in the first month. Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month were $400 * 2 = $800.
3. The total sales in the first month were the sum of the sales from red and green hats, which is $400 + $800 = $1200.
4. In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month were $1200 * 3/4 = $900.
5. The total sales over the two months would be the sum of the sales from the first and second months, which is $1200 + $900 = $2100.

Therefore, the total amount she made in two months is $2100."
"James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he is charged for 3 hours.

The first paid hour costs $15. Each hour after that is twice the cost, so the second hour costs $15 * 2 = $30, and the third hour costs $30 * 2 = $60.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of each hour:
$15 (first hour) + $30 (second hour) + $60 (third hour) = $105.

James paid $105."
"Sally's bank account increased from $200 to $420 this week. The difference in her bank account balance is:

$420 - $200 = $220

$300 - $220 = $80

Therefore, $80 were withheld from Sally’s wage."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed.
2. Determine the number of whole eggs required.
3. Convert the number of whole eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed.
- Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves.
- Lori is inviting 16 guests.
- Total deviled egg halves = 3 halves/guest * 16 guests = 48 halves.

Step 2: Determine the number of whole eggs required.
- 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves.
- Number of whole eggs needed = 48 halves / 2 halves/egg = 24 eggs.

Step 3: Convert the number of whole eggs into dozens.
- 1 dozen = 12 eggs.
- Number of dozens needed = 24 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 2 dozens.

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs."

"To calculate the total cost for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses for the hanger and fuel.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane**: $150,000
2. **Monthly Hanger Rental**: $5000
3. **Monthly Fuel Cost**: $5000 * 2 = $10,000

Now, let's calculate the total monthly cost for the hanger and fuel:
\[ \text{Total Monthly Cost} = \$5000 + \$10,000 = \$15,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the first year (12 months):
\[ \text{Total Annual Cost for Hanger and Fuel} = \$15,000 \times 12 = \$180,000 \]

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the total annual cost for the hanger and fuel:
\[ \text{Total Cost for the First Year} = \$150,000 + \$180,000 = \$330,000 \]

So, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is:
\[ \$330,000 \]"
"Given that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, we can use this information to find out how long it took to cook the other items.

1. The time to cook pork is 20 minutes more than the time to cook rice. Since it took 30 minutes to cook rice, the time to cook pork is:
   \[
   30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. The time to cook beans is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is:
   \[
   30 + 50 = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Therefore, the time to cook beans is:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. To find the total cooking time for all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans:
   \[
   30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \text{ minutes}
   \]

The total time it took to cook all the food is 120 minutes."
"To find out how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is \(5 + 5 = 10\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is \(2 + 5 = 7\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \(10 - 7 = 3\) dollars.

So, the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs $3 more than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

"Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, and geese have 2 legs and 1 head. We can set up the following equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20:
\[ S + G = 20 \]

2. The total number of legs is 70:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
\[ S + G = 20 \]
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

To solve for \( S \) and \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm."

"First, we need to determine the number of history teachers on the basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

This means there are 90 history teachers. Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

So, there are 60 math teachers. Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

The math teachers collectively spend 360 hours sleeping in one day."
"First, let's determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's amount as follows:

\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, we know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's amount as follows:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, we add together the amounts of money that Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia have:

\[ \text{Total money} = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360 \]

If they decide to share the money equally, each person would get:

\[ \text{Each person's share} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \]

So, if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them, each would have \(\boxed{120}\) dollars."
"The game originally consists of 4 quarters, each 12 minutes long. So, the total time for the 4 quarters is:

4 quarters * 12 minutes/quarter = 48 minutes

First, let's calculate the number of neutral days:
- Total days = 30
- Good days = 12
- Bad days = 8
- Neutral days = Total days - Good days - Bad days
- Neutral days = 30 - 12 - 8 = 10

Now, let's account for the next three days:
- The next three days are good, neutral, and good.
- This adds 2 more good days to her record.

So, the total number of good days now is:
- Original good days = 12
- Additional good days = 2
- Total good days = 12 + 2 = 14

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 14."
"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ 2S + 3 \]

We are also given that Janey has 21 books. So we can set up the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find the value of \( S \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 18 \]

Next, divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

Final numerical answer:
9"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches.
2. Calculate the total height increase needed for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.
3. Determine how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow the required additional height.

Step 1: Convert the current height from feet to inches.
- 1 foot = 12 inches
- Current height = 20 feet = 20 * 12 inches = 240 inches

Step 2: Calculate the total height increase needed.
- Target height = 600 inches
- Current height = 240 inches
- Height increase needed = 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Step 3: Determine the number of days required.
- Growth rate = 30 inches per day
- Number of days = Height increase needed / Growth rate = 360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches.

"To find out how many signatures Carol and Jennifer need to collect to reach their goal of 100 signatures, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of signatures they currently have.
2. Subtract the current total from their goal to find out how many more signatures they need.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of signatures they currently have.
Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures.
Total signatures = 20 + 44 = 64 signatures.

Step 2: Subtract the current total from their goal.
Their goal is 100 signatures.
Signatures needed = 100 - 64 = 36 signatures.

Therefore, Carol and Jennifer need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer."
"First, let's determine how much Karen earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many hours Karen works in two days. If she works 3 hours per day, then in two days she works:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate Karen's earnings for those 6 hours:

\[ 20 \times 6 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Karen earns \(\boxed{120}\) dollars in two days."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple proportion based on the given information.

If 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, then the ratio of potatoes to hash browns is 6:36, which simplifies to 1:6. This means that for every potato, you can make 6 hash browns.

Now, if you have 96 potatoes, you can calculate the number of hash browns as follows:

\[ \text{Number of hash browns} = 96 \times 6 = 576 \]

So, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes."
"To find out by how much the group of people will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we first need to calculate the total weight of the 9 people (Jack and 8 other adults).

The weight of one adult is 80 kg. Therefore, the total weight of 9 adults is:
\[ 80 \, \text{kg/adult} \times 9 \, \text{adults} = 720 \, \text{kg} \]

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out how much the group exceeds this limit, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight of the group:
\[ 720 \, \text{kg} - 700 \, \text{kg} = 20 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, the group will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"Given that Katarina has 68 cookies, we can work backwards to find out how many cookies Max and the Cookie Monster have.

1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has \(68 + 5 = 73\) cookies.
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has \(73 - 12 = 61\) cookies.
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has \(73 + 23 = 96\) cookies.

Now, to find the total number of cookies they have, we add up the cookies each one has:

\[68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298\]

They have a total of 298 cookies."
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the extension is \( 0.5x \) cm. Additionally, she adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom. Therefore, the total length of the dress after these modifications is:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 \]

We know that the final length of the dress is 140 cm. So, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, we divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]

\[ x = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

Final answer: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's find the mowing rates for both modes:
- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour, which is 60 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""turtle"" mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} \).
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""rabbit"" mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} \).

Now, we calculate the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode:
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes} \).
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes} \).

Finally, we add the times for both halves to find the total time:
- Total time = 30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes.

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn."
"John and Jack have 30 minutes in total to walk to school. They have already spent 6 minutes to get to the corner and another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. 

First, we add the time spent so far:
6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

Now, we subtract the time already spent from the total time they have:
30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes

So, they have 11 minutes longer to get to school without being late."
"Catherine buys:
- 1 kilo of apples for $4
- 2 kilos of bananas for $2 per kilo, which totals 2 * $2 = $4
- 2 kilos of oranges for $3 per kilo, which totals 2 * $3 = $6

$4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14

Therefore, Catherine pays a total of $14."
"Greta bakes 30 cookies. Celinda bakes twice as many, which means Celinda bakes \(30 \times 2 = 60\) cookies.

Together, they have \(30 + 60 = 90\) cookies.

They eat 10 of the cookies, so the number of cookies left is \(90 - 10 = 80\).

Therefore, there are 80 cookies in the box."
"Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as \( x \). Therefore, the age of the older triplet would be \( x + 7 \) because one twin is 7 years older than one triplet.

Since there is one set of twins, the age of each twin would be the same as the age of the older triplet, which is \( x + 7 \).

The combined ages of the four individuals (one twin, one triplet, and the other two triplets) are given as 44. So, we can write the equation as:

\[ (x + 7) + (x + 7) + x + (x + 7) = 44 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 4x + 21 = 44 \]

Subtract 21 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 23 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = \frac{23}{4} = 5.75 \]

So, the age of the younger triplet is 5.75 years. Therefore, the age of the twin, who is 7 years older, is:

\[ 5.75 + 7 = 12.75 \]

Final numerical answer:
12.75"
"First, let's convert the 3 hours before dinner into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Next, we add up the time John needs for his homework:
- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total time before dinner to find out how many minutes John has left for a nap:
180 minutes (total time) - 80 minutes (homework time) = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the candies. We know that 4 candies cost $3.20, so the cost of 10 candies would be:

\[ \text{Cost of 10 candies} = \frac{10}{4} \times 3.20 = 2.50 \times 3.20 = 8.00 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 lollipops. Each lollipop costs $0.40, so:

\[ \text{Cost of 10 lollipops} = 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the 10 lollipops and the 10 candies to find the total cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8.00 + 4.00 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $12.00."
"First, let's calculate how many coins Neil saves each month. Since Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong, we can calculate Neil's monthly savings as follows:

Rong saves 20 coins per month. Neil saves \( 20 + \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \) coins per month.

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

So, Neil saves \( 20 + 8 = 28 \) coins per month.

Now, let's calculate the total number of coins saved by both Rong and Neil over ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so over ten years, there are \( 10 \times 12 = 120 \) months.

Rong's total savings over ten years:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings over ten years:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding both totals together:
\[ 2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

Therefore, the total number of coins they have after ten years is 5760."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and the dog needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:

\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Let the total bill be \( x \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:

\[ 0.60x \]

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:

\[ x = 40 + 0.60x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. Subtract \( 0.60x \) from both sides:

\[ x - 0.60x = 40 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 0.40x = 40 \]

Now, divide both sides by 0.40:

\[ x = \frac{40}{0.40} = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:

\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, John leaves with $25."
"To find the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - Therefore, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = \$1.0\).
   - There are 5 bananas in a crate.
   - The total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = \$5.0\).

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in a crate.
   - The total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = \$6.0\).

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - Oranges cost three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1.0.
   - Therefore, one orange costs \(3 \times 1.0 = \$3.0\).
   - There are 7 oranges in a crate.
   - The total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = \$21.0\).

4. **Total Cost of the Crate:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges.
   - Total cost = Cost of bananas + Cost of apples + Cost of oranges
   - Total cost = \$5.0 + \$6.0 + \$21.0 = \$32.0

The price for such a crate of fruit is \(\$32.0\)."
"To find the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter, we need to determine the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. Red squares: 14
2. Blue squares: 4 more than red squares, so \(14 + 4 = 18\)
3. Green squares: 6 more than blue squares, so \(18 + 6 = 24\)
4. White squares: 12 fewer than green squares, so \(24 - 12 = 12\)

Now, we add up all the squares:
\[14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68\]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

1. **Determine the number of high chairs needed:**
   - The problem states that there are 8 high chairs.

2. **Calculate the number of regular chairs needed:**
   - The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs.
   - Therefore, the number of regular chairs = 5 * 8 = 40.

3. **Calculate the total number of chairs needed:**
   - The total number of chairs needed = number of high chairs + number of regular chairs.
   - Total chairs needed = 8 + 40 = 48.

4. **Determine the total number of people attending:**
   - There are 42 adults and 15 babies.
   - Total people = 42 + 15 = 57.

5. **Calculate the number of additional chairs needed:**
   - The number of additional chairs needed = total people - total chairs available.
   - Since the restaurant already has 48 chairs, the additional chairs needed = 57 - 48 = 9.

"To find the number of 8 point bucks, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bucks in the field.
2. Calculate the number of 8 point bucks from the total number of bucks.

Step 1: Calculate the number of bucks.
50 percent of the 50 deer are bucks. So, we calculate 50% of 50:
\[ 50 \times 0.50 = 25 \]
So, there are 25 bucks in the field.

Step 2: Calculate the number of 8 point bucks.
20 percent of the bucks are 8 points. So, we calculate 20% of 25:
\[ 25 \times 0.20 = 5 \]
So, there are 5 8 point bucks.

"First, let's calculate the points collected by each student:

1. Adam has 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. So, Betty's points are:
   \[
   50 + (0.30 \times 50) = 50 + 15 = 65 \text{ points}
   \]
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom's points are:
   \[
   65 - 30 = 35 \text{ points}
   \]
4. Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. So, Martha's points are:
   \[
   3 \times 35 = 105 \text{ points}
   \]

Now, let's sum up the points collected by all the students:
\[
50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 \text{ points}

The class is missing \(\boxed{145}\) points to go on the trip."
"To find out how many great-grandbabies will be at the family reunion, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.
2. Each of her children has 3 children of their own, so the number of grandchildren is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).
3. Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies of their own, so the number of great-grandbabies is \(9 \times 3 = 27\).

Therefore, the number of great-grandbabies at the family reunion is 27."
"First, let's calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400.00 paycheck into her retirement account:

\[ 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

So, she puts $1200.00 into her retirement account.

Next, we calculate how much she uses for her monthly car payment. She uses 20% of her $2400.00 paycheck for her car payment:

\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

So, she uses $480.00 for her car payment.

Now, we subtract the amounts she has spent from her total paycheck to find out how much she has left to spend:

\[ 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks set off by the city:

- The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each.
- Total fireworks from the city = 15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = 300 fireworks.

Hannah will see 40% of these fireworks:

- Hannah's view = 40% of 300 fireworks = 0.40 * 300 = 120 fireworks.

Next, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard:

- Hannah is setting off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each.
- Total fireworks from Hannah = 3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = 15 fireworks.

Now, we add the fireworks Hannah sees from the city display to the fireworks she sets off herself:

- Total fireworks Hannah sees = 120 fireworks (city) + 15 fireworks (her own) = 135 fireworks.

Therefore, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see in total is 135."
"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person saves a seat and buys enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats. Since each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks, and there are 20 people, the group will buy:

- \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) drinks
- \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) snacks

Each drink and snack costs $2, so the total cost for drinks is:

\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

And the total cost for snacks is:

\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount spent on drinks and snacks:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Number of Females and Males:**
   - Number of females = 6
   - Number of males = 8 (including Larry)

2. **Dumplings Eaten by Females:**
   - Each female ate 3 dumplings.
   - Total dumplings eaten by females = 6 females * 3 dumplings/female = 18 dumplings

3. **Dumplings Eaten by Males:**
   - Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female.
   - Therefore, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.
   - Total dumplings eaten by males = 8 males * 4 dumplings/male = 32 dumplings

4. **Total Dumplings Cooked:**
   - Total dumplings = Dumplings eaten by females + Dumplings eaten by males

The total parts of the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Each part is worth $100 / 5 = $20.

Since Gerald's share is 3 parts, he received 3 * $20 = $60.

If Gerald spent $10 on a book, the amount of money he has left is $60 - $10 = $50.

Therefore, Gerald has $50 left."
"First, we need to determine the speed of Martha's turtle. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

The cat's speed is 15 feet/second. So, the turtle's speed is:
\[ \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we need to calculate how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We do this by multiplying the turtle's speed by the time:
\[ 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find out how many more hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first need to determine how much more money they need to raise. 

The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount to be raised is:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money they raise per hour. They raised $2100 in the first 3 hours, so the hourly rate is:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Now, to find out how many more hours they need to raise the remaining $4200, we divide the remaining amount by the hourly rate:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours to reach their goal.

Therefore, the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal is:

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract the industrial usage from the total city usage to find the non-industrial usage.

Step 1: The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. So, the industrial usage is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 \text{ or } 32\% \]

Step 2: The non-industrial usage is the total city usage minus the industrial usage:
\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

Therefore, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

"To determine the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we first need to calculate the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream.

For chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Now, we need to calculate how much of each type of ice cream can be made in 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream in 48 hours:
- \( 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).

For vanilla ice cream in 48 hours:
- \( 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Adding the two amounts together gives the total production in 48 hours:
- \( 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \).

Therefore, the total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 3000 quarts."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Marcus ordered:

- Croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each = 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each = 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 muffins at $1.00 each = 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost before the discount:
Total cost = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off, we need to calculate 10% of $50.00 and subtract it from the total:
10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
$50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is $45.00."
"Erin has $6.00 and each scoop costs $1.50. With the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. 

First, let's calculate how many scoops she can buy with her $6.00 without considering the deal:
\[ \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

Now, let's see how the deal works. For every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 free. So, if she buys 2 scoops, she gets 3 scoops in total. 

If she buys 4 scoops, she would get 2 free scoops (since 4/2 = 2), making a total of 6 scoops.

Therefore, Erin should buy 4 scoops to maximize her ice cream consumption with the given deal.

\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

To find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger after two weeks, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks."
"To find out how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the area that needs to be covered, which is two-thirds of the bathroom.
2. Determine the number of tiles needed for that area.

First, let's find the area that needs to be covered:
\[ \text{Area to be covered} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \, \text{sq ft} = 24 \, \text{sq ft} \]

Next, since Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles for every square foot, we can calculate the total number of tiles needed for 24 square feet:
\[ \text{Total tiles needed} = 24 \, \text{sq ft} \times 24 \, \text{tiles/sq ft} = 576 \, \text{tiles} \]

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom."
"To determine how much James saved, we need to calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries and compare it to the cost of buying the same amount at the store.

1. **Cost of picking the blueberries:**
   - Initial cost to go picking: $20
   - Cost per pound: $1.5
   - Pounds of blueberries picked: 30

   Total cost for picking = Initial cost + (Cost per pound * Pounds picked)
   Total cost for picking = $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
   Total cost for picking = $20 + $45
   Total cost for picking = $65

2. **Cost of buying the blueberries at the store:**
   - Cost per pound at the store: $2.5
   - Pounds of blueberries: 30

   Total cost at the store = Cost per pound * Pounds
   Total cost at the store = $2.5 * 30
   Total cost at the store = $75

3. **Savings:**
   - Savings = Total cost at the store - Total cost for picking
   - Savings = $75 - $65
   - Savings = $10

James saved $10 compared to buying the blueberries at the store.

**Final numerical answer:**

"First, let's calculate the new price of each computer after the 10% increase.

The original price per computer was $700. A 10% increase on $700 is calculated as follows:
\[ 700 \times 0.10 = 70 \]

So, the new price per computer is:
\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money the company paid to buy 500 computers at the new price, we multiply the new price per computer by the number of computers:
\[ 770 \times 500 = 385,000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:
\[ 385,000 \]"
"To calculate the total calories in John's omelet, we need to sum the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

1. **Eggs**: John uses 6 eggs, and each egg is 75 calories.
   \[
   6 \text{ eggs} \times 75 \text{ calories/egg} = 450 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Cheese**: John uses 2 oz of cheese, and each ounce of cheese is 120 calories.
   \[
   2 \text{ oz} \times 120 \text{ calories/oz} = 240 \text{ calories}
   \]

3. **Ham**: John uses an equal amount of ham as cheese, which is 2 oz, and each ounce of ham is 40 calories.
   \[
   2 \text{ oz} \times 40 \text{ calories/oz} = 80 \text{ calories}
   \]

Now, we add up all the calories:
\[
450 \text{ calories (eggs)} + 240 \text{ calories (cheese)} + 80 \text{ calories (ham)} = 770 \text{ calories}
\]

The total number of calories in the omelet is 770."

The combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet is 2450."
"To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of having the city fix it and the total cost of Ron fixing it himself, then find the difference between these two amounts.

1. The cost to the city for fixing the pothole is $450.
2. The cost for Ron to fix it himself includes:
   - A fine for unauthorized road maintenance: $120
   - Cost of 3 buckets of asphalt: 3 buckets * $25 per bucket = $75

So, the total cost for Ron to fix the pothole himself is:
\[ \text{Fine} + \text{Cost of asphalt} = \$120 + \$75 = \$195 \]

Now, we find the difference between the cost to the city and the cost for Ron to fix it himself:
\[ \text{Cost to the city} - \text{Cost for Ron to fix it} = \$450 - \$195 = \$255 \]

Therefore, Ron saves \(\boxed{255}\) dollars by fixing the pothole himself."
"To find out how many chairs the restaurant has left, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

First, let's calculate the number of normal chairs left:
- Total normal chairs: 170
- Normal chairs sent for repair: 20
- Normal chairs left: 170 - 20 = 150

Next, let's calculate the number of baby chairs left:
- Total baby chairs: 23
- Baby chairs sent for repair: 13
- Baby chairs left: 23 - 13 = 10

Now, we add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs to get the total number of chairs left:
- Total chairs left: 150 (normal) + 10 (baby) = 160

The restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pizzas ordered. Since there are 5 people and each ordered one pizza, the total number of pizzas is 5.

Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate how many slices each group of friends ate.

Bryce and two friends ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas. Since there are 3 people in this group, the total number of slices they ate is:
\[ 3 \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \times 12 \right) = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

The two remaining friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas. So, the total number of slices they ate is:
\[ 2 \times \left( \frac{3}{4} \times 12 \right) = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Now, we add the slices eaten by both groups to find the total number of slices eaten:
\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices to find the number of slices left:
\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \]

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is:
18"
"The cat eats nine sausages in 30 minutes.

The dog eats the same nine sausages in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes. So, the time the dog takes is:
\[ 30 \times \frac{2}{3} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the average time the two take to eat the sausages, we add the time the cat takes and the time the dog takes, and then divide by 2:
\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

The average time the two take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches.
2. Set up an equation based on the given relationship between Topher's and Bobby's shoe lengths.
3. Solve the equation for the length of Bobby's shoe.

First, let's convert Topher's shoe length to inches. Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the feet to inches and then add the additional 4 inches:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]
\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, Topher's shoe is 100 inches long.

Next, we know that the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as \( x \) inches. According to the problem, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, each with 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter (1/4) of the students' cars' windows.

Number of students' cars' windows smashed:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 64 \times 4 = 64 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, each with 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters (3/4) of the teachers' cars' windows.

Number of teachers' cars' windows smashed:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 32 \times 2 = 48 \]

Now, we add the number of windows smashed for both students' and teachers' cars:
\[ 64 + 48 = 112 \]

Therefore, Hannah smashes a total of 112 windows."
"To find the percentage of spools that are blue, we first need to determine the total number of spools and the number of blue spools.

Candy has:
- 15 light blue spools
- 45 dark blue spools
- 40 light green spools
- 50 dark green spools

The total number of spools is:
15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 spools

The number of blue spools is:
15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60 blue spools

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\% \]

Therefore, 40% of her spools are blue."
"At 8:00, there were 5000 people in line to vote.

By midday (12:00), \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the people had voted. So, the number of people who had voted by midday is:

The number of people remaining in line by midday is:
\[ 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \]

By 16:00, \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the remaining people had voted. So, the number of people who had voted by 16:00 from the remaining 3000 is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \]

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:

Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of smores needed:**
   - **Kids:** 9 kids want 2 smores each, so \(9 \times 2 = 18\) smores.
   - **Adults:** 6 adults want 1 smore each, so \(6 \times 1 = 6\) smores.
   - **Total smores needed:** \(18 + 6 = 24\) smores.

2. **Calculate the number of smores that can be made from one box of graham crackers:**
   - Each sleeve makes 8 smores.
   - There are 3 sleeves in a box, so \(3 \times 8 = 24\) smores per box.

3. **Determine the number of boxes needed:**
   - Since 24 smores are needed and 24 smores can be made from one box, they will need \( \frac{24}{24} = 1 \) box.

Therefore, they will need **1 box** of graham crackers."
"First, let's calculate Dora's father's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, and her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age, we can write the equation for her father's age as:

\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 \]

Substituting Dora's age (15) into the equation:

\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we calculate Dora's mother's age. Since Dora's mother is four years younger than her father:

\[ \text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother by adding their ages together:

\[ \text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} \]
\[ \text{Total combined age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

Therefore, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87."

Cal's marbles = 112

Next, we know that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean:

Carl's marbles = 4 * Sean's marbles
Carl's marbles = 4 * 56
Carl's marbles = 224

To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add their individual amounts:

Total marbles = Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles
Total marbles = 224 + 112
Total marbles = 336

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many students will be in each of the six groups when fifty-four students are divided equally among them.

1. Calculate the number of students per group when divided into six groups:
\[ \frac{54}{6} = 9 \]

So, each of the six groups will have 9 students.

2. Now, we need to find out how many students are required for 12 groups, assuming each group should have the same number of students as the six groups (9 students per group):
\[ 12 \times 9 = 108 \]

3. Since we only have 54 students, we need to find out how many more students are required to form 12 groups of 9 students each:
\[ 108 - 54 = 54 \]

4. To find out how many more groups are needed, we divide the additional number of students required by the number of students per group (9):
\[ \frac{54}{9} = 6 \]

Therefore, 6 more groups are needed to form 12 groups of 9 students each.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

1. **Weekday Rentals:**
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays.
   - Since 60 chairs are rented each weekday, the total number of chairs rented during weekdays in one 4-week month is \(60 \times 20 = 1200\) chairs.

2. **Weekend Rentals:**
   - There are 2 weekend days in a week.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.
   - Since 100 chairs are rented each weekend day, the total number of chairs rented during weekends in one 4-week month is \(100 \times 8 = 800\) chairs.

3. **Total Rentals in One 4-Week Month:**
   - The total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month is the sum of weekday and weekend rentals, which is \(1200 + 800 = 2000\) chairs.

4. **Total Rentals in Two 4-Week Months:**
   - Since the pattern repeats, the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months is \(2000 \times 2 = 4000\) chairs.

Therefore, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is **4000**."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Gunther initially had 48 bananas.
2. Arnold stole half of the bananas, so Arnold took \( \frac{48}{2} = 24 \) bananas. This left Gunther with \( 48 - 24 = 24 \) bananas.
3. The next day, Gunther added 25 more bananas to his pile, making the total \( 24 + 25 = 49 \) bananas.
4. Arnold then stole 12 bananas, leaving Gunther with \( 49 - 12 = 37 \) bananas.
5. On the third day, Gunther added another 6 bananas, making the total \( 37 + 6 = 43 \) bananas.

So, the final number of bananas in the pile is 43.

"First, we calculate the monthly share for each roommate:

Total monthly electricity bill = $100
Number of roommates = 4

Monthly share per roommate = Total monthly electricity bill / Number of roommates
Monthly share per roommate = $100 / 4
Monthly share per roommate = $25

Next, we calculate the annual share for each roommate:

Number of months in a year = 12

Annual share per roommate = Monthly share per roommate * Number of months in a year
Annual share per roommate = $25 * 12
Annual share per roommate = $300

Each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."
"Jeff initially sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates for the party.

8 dozen glasses = 8 * 12 = 96 glasses

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers and Conversion Rates:**
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.
   - A small sticker is worth one small button.
   - A large button is worth three small stickers.

2. **Lorraine's Initial Stickers:**
   - 30 small stickers
   - 40 large stickers

3. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons.

5. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

6. **Total Buttons:**
   - Small buttons from trading small stickers: 27
   - Large buttons from trading large stickers: 20
   - Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60

7. **Summing Up the Buttons:**
   - Total buttons = 27 (small) + 20 (large) + 60 (small) = 107 buttons.

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against the regulation. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need size extra-small.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra-small. So, \(2 \times 11 = 22\) students need size small.
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So, \(22 - 4 = 18\) students need size medium.
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. So, \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\) students need size large.
5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. So, \(9 + 6 = 15\) students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up all the shirts:

- XS: 11
- S: 22
- M: 18
- L: 9
- XL: 15

Total number of shirts = \(11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75\)

"To find out how many puppies Jana has, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Pomeranians.
2. Use the total number of Pomeranians to find the total number of puppies.

Given that one third of the Pomeranians are girls and there are 6 Pomeranian girls, we can set up the following equation to find the total number of Pomeranians:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times \text{Total Pomeranians} = 6
\]

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

\[
\text{Total Pomeranians} = 6 \times 3 = 18
\]

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's denote the total number of puppies as \( P \). According to the problem, two thirds of \( P \) are Pomeranians, so we can write:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times P = 18
\]

To find \( P \), we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{2}{3}\), which is \(\frac{3}{2}\):

\[
P = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27
\]

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies."

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3.5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 3.5:
\[ x = \frac{250}{3.5} = \frac{2500}{35} = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases, so:
\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Therefore, the third house will need approximately 142.86 cases of shingles. However, since the problem asks for a final numerical answer, we'll round to the nearest whole number if necessary, but the exact answer is:

\[ \boxed{\frac{1000}{7}} \]"

"First, let's calculate how many pears George has. Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, we can find the number of pears by calculating 45% of the number of bananas and then adding that to the number of bananas.

Number of bananas = 200
45% of 200 = 0.45 * 200 = 90

So, the number of pears = 200 + 90 = 290

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and the number of pears together:

Total number of fruits = Number of bananas + Number of pears
Total number of fruits = 200 + 290 = 490

Therefore, George has 490 fruits."

"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Mike has 600 movies in total.
2. A third of these movies are in series, so the number of series movies is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \).
3. The cost for series movies is $6 each, so the total cost for series movies is \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \) dollars.

4. The remaining movies are \( 600 - 200 = 400 \).
5. 40% of these remaining movies are older movies, so the number of older movies is \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \).
6. The cost for older movies is $5 each, so the total cost for older movies is \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars.

7. The remaining movies are \( 400 - 160 = 240 \).
8. These remaining movies are normal movies, and each costs $10, so the total cost for normal movies is \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \) dollars.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Points from enemies:**
   - Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
   - Points for each enemy = 10.
   - So, the difference in points from enemies = 8 * 10 = 80 points.

2. **Points from berries:**
   - Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
   - Points for each berry = 5.
   - So, the difference in points from berries = 3 * 5 = 15 points.

3. **Points from time:**
   - Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma.
   - Points for each second left on the timer = 30.
   - So, the difference in points from time = -4 * 30 = -120 points (negative because Ava is slower).

Now, we add up the differences:
- Difference from enemies: +80 points
- Difference from berries: +15 points
- Difference from time: -120 points

Total difference in scores = 80 + 15 - 120 = -25 points.

So, the difference between their two scores is -25 points."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The total cost of the four pizzas is $64.
2. Two of the pizzas cost $30 in total.
3. We need to find the cost of each of the other two pizzas, which cost the same amount.

First, we calculate the total cost of the other two pizzas:
\[ \text{Total cost of four pizzas} - \text{Total cost of two pizzas} = \text{Total cost of other two pizzas} \]
\[ 64 - 30 = 34 \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of these two pizzas by 2:
\[ \text{Cost of each of the other two pizzas} = \frac{34}{2} = 17 \]

So, each of the other two pizzas cost $17.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish as \( W \). Initially, Bob had 3 orange and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had \( 3 + O \) orange fish and \( 4 + W \) white fish. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

We also know that the total number of fish he bought is 17, so:

\[ O + W = 17 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

First, simplify the first equation:
\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]
\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

Now we have the simplified system:
1. \( O - 2W = 5 \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use substitution. From the second equation, we can express \( O \) in terms of \( W \):
\[ O = 17 - W \]

Substitute this into the first equation:
\[ 17 - W - 2W = 5 \]
\[ 17 - 3W = 5 \]
\[ -3W = 5 - 17 \]
\[ -3W = -12 \]
\[ W = 4 \]

Now substitute \( W = 4 \) back into the equation \( O + W = 17 \):
\[ O + 4 = 17 \]
\[ O = 13 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish and 13 orange fish. The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:

- Total cost: 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15

Therefore, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week on gas for his commute."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received from her aunt.

Carrie was given ten twenties, which is:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

She was also given 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount from the quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Carrie received is:
\[ 200 + 35 = 235 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she spent. She spent 3/5 of the twenties and all the quarters.

The amount spent on the twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount spent on the quarters is:
\[ 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money she paid for the lunch is:
\[ 120 + 35 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

Final answer:
\[ 155 \]"
"To find out how many fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo has 5 tomato plants.
- Therefore, the total number of tomatoes is \(22 \times 5 = 110\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants.
- Therefore, the total number of eggplants is \(4 \times 8 = 32\).

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:
- Total number of fruits = Total number of tomatoes + Total number of eggplants
- Total number of fruits = \(110 + 32 = 142\).

Therefore, Ricardo can get 142 fruits from his plants."
"To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we first need to calculate the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold.

Given that one-fourth of the sales are smart TVs, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

Given that one-eighth of the sales are analog TVs, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \]

Now, to find the number of OLED TVs sold, we subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (\text{Number of smart TVs} + \text{Number of analog TVs}) \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (10 + 5) \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - 15 \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 25 \]

So, they were able to sell 25 OLED TVs."
"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total cost of the trip.
2. Calculate the amount the school will cover.
3. Calculate the amount John still needs to raise.

The total cost of the trip is $300. The school will cover half of this cost, so the school will contribute:
\[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

This means John needs to raise the other half of the cost, which is also $150. John currently has $50, so the amount he still needs to raise is:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the amount of money John is missing is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, we need to determine the temperature during the night. If it's 33 degrees colder at night than during the day, and the day temperature is 45 degrees, then the night temperature is:

45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, Carson needs to raise the temperature from 12 degrees to 32 degrees. The difference in temperature that needs to be raised is:

32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees

Each log of wood burns raises the temperature by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn to raise the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the temperature difference by the temperature increase per log:

20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing."
"First, we need to determine the number of 9-person groups that can be formed from 90 people. This is calculated by dividing the total number of people by the group size:

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups are part of the 3/5 fraction that brings back seashells. This is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Number of groups bringing seashells} = \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]

Each of these 6 groups brings back 2 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is:

\[ \text{Total seashells} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the changes in the number of people on the train step by step.

1. Initially, there are 172 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 47 people get off, so we subtract 47 from 172:
   \[
   172 - 47 = 125
   \]
3. Then, 13 more people get on the train, so we add 13 to 125:
   \[
   125 + 13 = 138
   \]
4. At the next stop, 38 people get off, so we subtract 38 from 138:
   \[
   138 - 38 = 100
   \]

Therefore, the final number of people on the train is 100."
"To calculate how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many bottle caps Damien finds in a day.
2. Calculate the value of the bottle caps he finds in a day.
3. Multiply the daily value by the number of days in the month.

Step 1: Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day.

Step 2: Each bottle cap is worth $0.25, so the value of the bottle caps he finds in a day is:
\[ 10 \text{ bottle caps/day} \times \$0.25/\text{bottle cap} = \$2.50/\text{day} \]

Step 3: To find out how much money he makes in a 30-day month, we multiply the daily value by 30:
\[ \$2.50/\text{day} \times 30 \text{ days} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, Damien makes \(\$75.00\) in a 30-day month."
"Jamie's regular hourly rate is $20 per hour. For the additional hours worked beyond her regular 8-hour day, she is paid at a rate of 150% of her regular hourly rate.

First, calculate the special hourly rate for the additional hours:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } \$20 = 1.5 \times \$20 = \$30 \text{ per hour} \]

On Tuesday, Jamie worked 11 hours. The first 8 hours are paid at her regular rate, and the remaining 3 hours are paid at the special rate.

Calculate the pay for the first 8 hours:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$160 \]

Calculate the pay for the additional 3 hours:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$90 \]

Add the two amounts to find the total pay for the day:
\[ \$160 + \$90 = \$250 \]

Therefore, Jamie was paid \(\$250\) for her work on Tuesday."
"The zookeeper counts 12 female lions. There are half as many male lions, which means there are 12 / 2 = 6 male lions. Additionally, there are 14 lion cubs. 

To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and cubs together:

12 (female lions) + 6 (male lions) + 14 (cubs) = 32 lions

So, there are 32 lions in the enclosure."
"First, we need to calculate the discount on the jeans. The jeans are 25% off, and the original price is $40. 

To find the discount amount, we calculate 25% of $40:
\[ 25\% \times 40 = 0.25 \times 40 = 10 \]

So, the discount is $10. 

Next, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

The sale price of the jeans is $30. 

Mike pays with a $50.00 bill. To find out how much money he will have left over, we subtract the sale price of the jeans from the amount he paid:
\[ 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, Mike will have $20.00 left over."
"The company hires 20 new employees every month. Over three months, the total number of new hires is:

20 employees/month * 3 months = 60 new employees

The initial number of employees is 200. Adding the new hires, the total number of employees after three months is:

200 initial employees + 60 new employees = 260 employees

Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month. Therefore, the total monthly salary for all employees is:

260 employees * $4000/employee = $1,040,000

To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we multiply the total monthly salary by 3:

$1,040,000/month * 3 months = $3,120,000

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is $3,120,000."

   \]

Therefore, the choir will be caroling for 540 seconds."
"First, let's determine Billy's hourly wage at each stage of his employment:

1. **Initial wage**: $10 per hour.
2. **After 2 months**: $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.
3. **On his first anniversary**: $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate Billy's earnings for 20 hours of work at his final wage:

\[ 20 \text{ hours} \times \$11.50 \text{ per hour} = \$230 \]

Next, we need to determine Sally's starting wage. Since Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary:

\[ \$10 + \$0.50 = \$10.50 \]

Now, let's calculate Sally's earnings for 20 hours of work at her starting wage:

\[ 20 \text{ hours} \times \$10.50 \text{ per hour} = \$210 \]

Finally, we find the difference in their earnings:

"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 stuffed animals

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 0.30 \times (14 + x) = x \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30x = x \]
\[ 4.2 + 0.30x = x \]
\[ 4.2 = x - 0.30x \]
\[ 4.2 = 0.70x \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students, then divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students.

First, let's calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
- Fourth graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
- Fifth graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders, so it's \(2 \times \frac{40}{100} = \frac{80}{100} = 0.8\) or 80%. Therefore, 80% of 400 fifth graders passed, which is \(0.8 \times 400 = 320\).

Now, let's sum up the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total students who passed: \(340 + 40 + 320 = 680\)
- Total students: \(500 + 100 + 400 = 1000\)

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students:

\[
\text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{680}{1000} = 0.68

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of the mosaic he can make with the total number of chips.
3. Calculate the length of the mosaic given its height.

First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has in total. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, we multiply:

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12:

\[ 144 \text{ chips} \div 12 \text{ chips/square inch} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Now, we know the mosaic will be 3 inches tall. To find the length of the mosaic, we divide the total area by the height:

\[ 12 \text{ square inches} \div 3 \text{ inches} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of the mosaic Milo can make is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month, starting from the beginning of the year, and then find the difference between the number of students at the end of May and the initial number of students.

1. **Beginning of the year (January):** 10 students
2. **End of January:** The number of students doubles, so \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
3. **End of February:** The number of students doubles again, so \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
4. **End of March:** The number of students doubles again, so \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
5. **End of April:** The number of students doubles again, so \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
6. **End of May:** The number of students doubles again, so \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

Now, we need to find the additional students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year.

The number of students at the beginning of the year is 10, and at the end of May, it is 320. The additional students are:

So, the additional students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. He made $105 during the week. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = 420 \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches climbed per day:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = 60 \]

Therefore, on average, Felix climbed 60 branches per day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picked:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\]

Next, we account for the flowers that are dropped. She drops 1 of each type of flower, so she drops:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\]

"First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they use:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Next, we need to account for the marshmallows that were dropped on the ground. They dropped 3 marshmallows, so we subtract these from the total number of marshmallows initially in the bag:

\[ 35 - 3 = 32 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Now, we subtract the marshmallows used by John and DeSean from the remaining marshmallows:

\[ 32 - 18 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

These 14 marshmallows are the ones left to make more S'mores. Since John and DeSean are sharing these remaining marshmallows equally, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores each} \]

So, each kid can have 7 more S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

"Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter. 

Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for 10 minutes each with 1 quarter.

The better friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for 30 minutes with 1 quarter.

They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.

Let's calculate the number of quarters each person uses:

- Jack: 240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters
- Two friends: 240 minutes / 10 minutes per quarter = 24 quarters (2 friends * 12 quarters each)
- Better friend: 240 minutes / 30 minutes per quarter = 8 quarters

Total quarters used: 12 (Jack) + 24 (2 friends) + 8 (better friend) = 44 quarters

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total money used is 44 quarters * $0.25 = $11.

"Let's denote the amount of citrus zest used as \( z \) ounces. Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.

The amount of salt used is \( s \) ounces. Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.

The amount of oil used is \( 2s \) ounces because it is twice the amount of salt.

According to the problem, the amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so we have:
\[ s = 2z \]

The total amount of ingredients used is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total amount of ingredients as:
\[ s + s + z + z + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 4s + 2z = 10 \]

Substituting \( s = 2z \) into the equation:
\[ 4(2z) + 2z = 10 \]
\[ 8z + 2z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find \( s \):
\[ s = 2z = 2 \times 1 = 2 \]

The amount of oil used is \( 2s \):
\[ 2s = 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil used is 4 ounces."
"To find out how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows, then add these two amounts together.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John bought 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John bought 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the overall amount spent:
- Total cost of goats: $1500
- Total cost of cows: $3000
- Therefore, the total amount spent is \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:
4500"
"Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes for the party. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, which adds up to 48 cupcakes.

To find out how many more cupcakes Paul should buy, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number he needs:

63 (total needed) - 48 (already has) = 15

Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"First, let's determine how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. So, the number of cars he gives away is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of cars Joe has sold and given away:

\[ 8 + 16 = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Finally, to find out how many cars Joe remains with, we subtract the total number of cars sold and given away from the initial number of cars Joe had:

\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Joe remains with 16 cars after selling and giving some to his mother."
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount raised by the students.
2. Divide this amount by the number of students.

First, we know the total amount raised for the charity is $175,000. Out of this, $50,000 comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to divide this amount by the number of students, which is 20:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\) dollars."
"Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as many hours, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time she walked over the two days, we add the hours from both days: 8 + 4 = 12 hours.

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 12 * 60 = 720 minutes.

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars entered, making the total:

50 + 20 = 70 cars

When he got out for lunch, half of the cars left the parking lot. So, the number of cars that left is:

70 / 2 = 35 cars

Therefore, the total number of cars left in the parking lot during the lunch break is:

70 - 35 = 35 cars

The total number of cars he counted during the lunch break is 35."
"To calculate how much John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tasks John does in a day.
2. Calculate the total number of tasks John does in a week.
3. Calculate the total earnings based on the number of tasks and the pay per task.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of tasks per day.
John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 tasks.
So, the total number of tasks per day is \(30 \times 5 = 150\).

Step 2: Calculate the total number of tasks per week.
Since John works 7 days a week, the total number of tasks per week is \(150 \times 7 = 1050\).

Step 3: Calculate the total earnings.
Each task pays $1.20, so the total earnings for the week are \(1050 \times 1.20 = 1260\).

Therefore, John makes \(\$1260\) in a full 7-day week."
"In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her scores from each game: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

Total points Sasha scored during both games: 18."
"To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we need to calculate the total number of tins for each type of food and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food:
- Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food.
- Each package contains 11 tins.
- Therefore, the total number of tins of cat food is \(8 \times 11 = 88\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food:
- Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food.
- Each package contains 6 tins.
- Therefore, the total number of tins of dog food is \(6 \times 6 = 36\).

Now, we find the difference between the total number of tins of cat food and dog food:
- The difference is \(88 - 36 = 52\).

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

52"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have:
\[ \text{Smendrick's cards} = 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \]
\[ \text{Becca's cards} = 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.
3. She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs:

- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

Total number of eggs = \(5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27\)

Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the refund she will receive and the cost of shipping the book back. Then, we'll subtract the refund from the original cost of the book to find the net loss.

1. **Calculate the refund amount:**
   - The book's purchase price is $32.
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price.
   - Refund amount = $32 * 0.75 = $24.

2. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds.
   - The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
   - Shipping cost for weight = 4 * $0.35 = $1.40.
   - The book needs to be returned 20 miles away.
   - The shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
   - Shipping cost for distance = 20 * $0.08 = $1.60.
   - Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - Original cost of the book = $32.
   - Refund amount = $24.
   - Net loss = Original cost - Refund amount - Shipping cost = $32 - $24 - $3 = $5.

Milly will lose $5."
"Mulan starts with $40 and her father gives her $100, so she has:

$40 + $100 = $140

She then buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, which costs:

2 * $30 = $60

And she buys a bag for $20. So the total cost of her purchases is:

$60 + $20 = $80

Subtracting the total cost of her purchases from her total money gives:

$140 - $80 = $60

Mulan has $60 left."
"Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate in the first week.

In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, which is:
\[ \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \text{ bars} \]

In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, which is:
\[ 8,000 \times 3 = 24,000 \text{ bars} \]

To find out how much he produces in the fourth week, we need to subtract the total production of the first three weeks from the monthly production:
\[ 50,000 - (8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000) = 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars} \]

So, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week."
"To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on each activity and then sum them up for a month with four weeks.

1. **Video Production Time:**
   - Britany records 18 4-minute videos each week.
   - Total video time per week = 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes.
   - Total video time per month = 72 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 288 minutes.

2. **Song Writing Time:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Total song writing time per month = 2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 8 hours.

3. **Makeup Time:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - Total makeup time per week = 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes.
   - Total makeup time per month = 90 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 360 minutes.

Now, let's convert all the times to the same unit for easier addition. We'll convert everything to minutes:

- Video time per month: 288 minutes
- Song writing time per month: 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes
- Makeup time per month: 360 minutes

Total time spent on TikTok in a month = 288 minutes (video) + 480 minutes (song writing) + 360 minutes (makeup) = 1128 minutes.

So, Britany spends 1128 minutes on TikTok in a month with four weeks."
"To calculate the total cost for Angela, we need to break down the charges based on the information provided.

1. **Base Installation Cost**: The base cost for hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures is $129.00.

2. **Additional Items**:
   - Angela needs 6 mirrors, but the base cost already includes 4 mirrors. So, she needs 2 additional mirrors.
   - Angela needs 2 chandeliers, but the base cost already includes 1 chandelier. So, she needs 1 additional chandelier.
   - Angela needs 20 pictures, but the base cost already includes 10 pictures. So, she needs 10 additional pictures.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - Additional mirrors: 2 mirrors * $15.00 per item = $30.00
   - Additional chandeliers: 1 chandelier * $15.00 per item = $15.00
   - Additional pictures: 10 pictures * $15.00 per item = $150.00

4. **Total Additional Cost**: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

5. **Total Cost**: Base installation cost + Total additional cost = $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00

**Final Answer**: $324.00"
"Eva has saved $20.00. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved:

\[ 20.00 + 10.00 = 30.00 \]

Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings:

\[ 0.40 \times 30.00 = 12.00 \]

So, Roy has saved:

\[ 30.00 + 12.00 = 42.00 \]

Roy has saved $42.00."
"To solve this problem, we need to work through the relationships step by step.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches high.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 48 inches high (12 inches * 4).
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 480 inches high (48 inches * 10).

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 480 inches to feet by dividing by 12:

\[ \frac{480 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high."
"Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour. 

For the first part of his journey, he travels for 4 hours. The distance covered in this part is:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

After resting, he travels for another 6 hours. The distance covered in this part is:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the distances from both parts of his journey gives the total distance:
\[ 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for four turtles to travel the same distance that three kangaroos travel in 18 hours, given that each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo.

First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos. If three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel a certain distance, then the speed of the kangaroos can be represented as the distance divided by the time. Let's denote the distance as \(D\) and the speed of one kangaroo as \(S\). The total speed of the three kangaroos combined is \(3S\).

The distance \(D\) can be calculated as:
\[ D = 3S \times 18 \]

Now, let's consider the speed of the turtles. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{S}{2} \). The total speed of four turtles is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{S}{2} = 2S \]

We need to find the time \(T\) it takes for the four turtles to travel the same distance \(D\). Using the formula \( \text{distance} = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \), we can write:
\[ D = 2S \times T \]

We already know that \(D = 3S \times 18\), so we can substitute this into the equation:
\[ 3S \times 18 = 2S \times T \]

We can cancel \(S\) from both sides of the equation (assuming \(S \neq 0\)):
\[ 3 \times 18 = 2T \]
\[ 54 = 2T \]
\[ T = \frac{54}{2} \]
\[ T = 27 \]

So, it will take the four turtles 27 hours to travel the same distance. 

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"Kora made 20 dishes.

Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora, so Rory makes:
20 (Kora's dishes) + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada makes:
2 * 40 (Rory's dishes) = 80 dishes.

Together, they make:
20 (Kora's dishes) + 40 (Rory's dishes) + 80 (Jada's dishes) = 140 dishes.

Final numerical answer:
140"
"First, let's determine the final price of the laptop after the trade-in. The original price is $600, and the trade-in reduces the price by $200. So, the final price is:

\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she currently has:

\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \]

This $350 is the sum of the money she already has in her purse, the $150 she earned from her part-time job, and the $80 her mom gave her. So, we can set up the following equation to find out how much money she has in her purse:

\[ \text{Money in purse} + 150 + 80 = 350 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ \text{Money in purse} + 230 = 350 \]

To find the money in her purse, we subtract 230 from 350:

\[ \text{Money in purse} = 350 - 230 = 120 \]

So, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of apple slices Adam gets from slicing the apples.

- From 3 large apples, he gets \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices.
- From 5 small apples, he gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.

So, the total number of slices is \(15 + 15 = 30\).

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is \(30 - 15 = 15\).

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is 15."
"The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk a day from one cow. Therefore, with 3 cows, he extracts:

\[ 5 \, \text{liters/cow} \times 3 \, \text{cows} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, he needs:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed is:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and then sum these lengths.

1. The first glue stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left, so it has \( 1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6} \) not used. Since the original length of each glue stick is 12 millimeters, the unused length of the first glue stick is \( 12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \) millimeters.

2. The second glue stick has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left, so it has \( 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \) not used. The unused length of the second glue stick is \( 12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \) millimeters.

3. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left, so it has \( 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \) not used. The unused length of the third glue stick is \( 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \) millimeters.

Adding these unused lengths together, we get:
\[ 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \]

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 millimeters."
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the car and the phone, and then subtract the amount of money he already has.

1. Total cost of the car and phone: $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800
2. Total amount of money Gabriel has: $5000 (from working) + $200 (from his brother) = $5200

Now, subtract the amount of money Gabriel has from the total cost:

$10800 (total cost) - $5200 (amount Gabriel has) = $5600

Gabriel still needs $5600."
"Thea gave the craftsman four $20 bills, which totals to:

"Craig starts with 2 twenty dollar bills, which amounts to $40.

He spends $2 on each of the six squirt guns, so that's \(6 \times 2 = $12\).

He spends $3 on each of the three packs of water balloons, so that's \(3 \times 3 = $9\).

The total amount spent is \(12 + 9 = $21\).

Subtracting the total amount spent from the initial amount, we get \(40 - 21 = $19\).

Therefore, Craig has $19 left."
"Given:
- Jack collected 60 dishes.
- Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) socks.
- Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
- Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
- Jack's total: \( 30 \) socks + \( 60 \) dishes = \( 90 \)
- Peter's total: \( 60 \) socks + \( 30 \) dishes = \( 90 \)

Adding both totals together:
- Total number of socks and dishes: \( 90 + 90 = 180 \)

"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

- 5 students are good at math only.
- The rest of the students are good at both math and English. Since there are 20 students in total and 5 are good at math only, the number of students good at both subjects is \(20 - 5 - 8 = 7\).

So, the total number of students good at math (both only and both) is \(5 + 7 = 12\).

Therefore, the number of students good at math is 12."
"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group takes and then see how many such intervals fit into the total concert time, including the intermission.

1. Calculate the total time each group takes:
   - Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
   - Performance time: 6 minutes
   - Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes
   - Total time per group: 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

2. Calculate the total available time for the concert, excluding the intermission:
   - Total concert time: 2 hours = 120 minutes
   - Subtract the intermission time: 120 - 10 = 110 minutes

3. Determine how many groups can perform in the available time:
   - Number of groups = Total available time / Time per group = 110 / 10 = 11

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
11 groups can perform in the concert."
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years with simple interest, we first need to understand the interest rate and how it applies to the principal amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year. Since the original amount is $300, the interest rate per year is:

\[ \text{Interest Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\% \]

However, an interest rate of 225% per year is not typical for simple interest calculations. It seems there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement. Typically, interest rates are expressed as a decimal (e.g., 225% would be 2.25 in decimal form). Let's assume the problem meant to say the interest rate is 225% per year, which would be 2.25 in decimal form.

The formula for simple interest is:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Where:
- Principal (P) = $300
- Rate (R) = 2.25 (225% as a decimal)
- Time (T) = 3 years

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 \]

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 6.75 \]

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 2025 \]

The total amount after 3 years is the sum of the principal and the simple interest:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 2025 \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 2325 \]

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $2325."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total white shirts**: 40
2. **Total floral shirts**: 50

**White shirts with collars**:
- Half of the white shirts have collars.
- Therefore, the number of white shirts with collars = \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).

**White shirts with no collars**:
- Total white shirts - White shirts with collars = \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

**Floral shirts with buttons**:
- 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.

**Floral shirts with no buttons**:
- Total floral shirts - Floral shirts with buttons = \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

**Difference between floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars**:
- Floral shirts with no buttons - White shirts with no collars = \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

Therefore, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

**Final numerical answer**: 10"
"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we first need to determine how many trays he can fill with 900 eggs, given that each tray holds 30 eggs. 

\[ \text{Number of trays} = \frac{\text{Total number of eggs}}{\text{Number of eggs per tray}} = \frac{900}{30} = 30 \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray.

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of trays} \times \text{Price per tray} = 30 \times 2.5 = 75 \]

Therefore, the farmer will earn $75."
"Initially, Mr. Smith has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y.

He sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is:
55 - 10 = 45 goats

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X, which means he sold:
2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y

So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
45 - 20 = 25 goats

Altogether, the number of goats left in the two farms is:
45 (from Farm X) + 25 (from Farm Y) = 70 goats

\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, on average, James pays $110 for each pair of shoes."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food.
2. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount applied.
3. Add the two amounts to get the total cost.

Step 1: Cost of 3 baskets of green food
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- Therefore, 3 baskets of green food cost \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

Step 2: Cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount
- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- With a $2 discount for each basket, the cost per basket of red food is \(18 - 2 = 16\) dollars.
- Therefore, 3 baskets of red food cost \(3 \times 16 = 48\) dollars.

Step 3: Total cost
- The total cost is the sum of the cost of the green food and the red food.
- Total cost = \(75 + 48 = 123\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount you will have to pay is $123."
"To find out how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of rooms that constitute one-half of the motel.
2. Determine the total time required to clean these rooms.
3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

Step 1: Calculate one-half of the rooms.
\[ \text{Number of rooms to clean} = \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Step 2: Determine the total time required to clean 45 rooms.
\[ \text{Time to clean one room} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ \text{Total time to clean 45 rooms} = 45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Step 3: Convert the total time from minutes to hours.
\[ \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{900}{60} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms."
"In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.

By the end of the second year, the total number of homes built is \(12 + 36 = 48\).

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built by the end of the second year, which is \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Therefore, the total number of homes built over the next three years is \(12 + 36 + 96 = 144\).

"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( Y \) be the age of the person (you).
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( M \) be the age of the mother.

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( Y = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( Y = S + 2 \) or \( S = Y - 2 \).
3. Your mother's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( Y + B + S + M = 87 \).

Substituting the expressions for \( Y \), \( S \), and \( M \) into the sum equation, we get:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 3 - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]
Simplifying the left side:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]
Adding 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]
Dividing by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, we can find the other ages:
- Your age \( Y = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \).
- Your sister's age \( S = Y - 2 = 13 - 2 = 11 \).
- Your mother's age \( M = 3B - 1 = 3 \times 16 - 1 = 48 - 1 = 47 \).

To verify, we add all the ages:
\[ 13 + 16 + 11 + 47 = 87 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.
2. Determine how many packs are required to meet this need, considering he can only buy whole packs and wants to have some extra glue sticks.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.
- There are 27 students.
- Each student needs 2 glue sticks.
- Total glue sticks needed = 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks.

Step 2: Determine the number of packs required.
- Glue sticks come in packs of 8.
- To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack and round up to the nearest whole number because he can only buy whole packs and wants to have some extra glue sticks.
- 54 glue sticks ÷ 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs.
- Since he can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number, which is 7 packs.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks."
"On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles, so the new amount is:
\[ 4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons} \]

On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day is:
\[ 8000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 14000 \text{ gallons} \]

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point is:

"Rafaela received a $20 tip from each of the forty customers, so the total amount of tips she received is:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \text{ dollars} \]

Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find out how much less, we calculate 10% of $800:

\[ 10\% \times 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Julieta received:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their individual amounts:

"Jennifer initially bought 12 oranges.

She gave 2 oranges to each of her three daughters, which totals:
2 oranges/daughter × 3 daughters = 6 oranges

She also gave 3 oranges to her son.

So, the total number of oranges given away is:
6 oranges (to daughters) + 3 oranges (to son) = 9 oranges

Therefore, the number of oranges Jennifer remained with is:
12 oranges (initially bought) - 9 oranges (given away) = 3 oranges

Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"Claire earns 1 badge every month. In a year, which has 12 months, Claire will earn:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so in the same 12 months, Amber will earn:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ badges}}{2} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so in 12 months, Wendy will earn:
\[ 12 \text{ badges} \times 3 = 36 \text{ badges} \]

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1 year time frame, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:
\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame."

"Let's break down the information given:

1. There are 12 red cars.
2. There are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so there are \(12 - 2 = 10\) green cars.
3. There are 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so there are \(3 \times 10 = 30\) blue cars.

Now, let's add up the red, green, and blue cars:
\[12 + 10 + 30 = 52\]

The total number of cars in the rink is 75. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:

Therefore, the number of yellow cars is 23."
"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as \( F \), Anne has as \( A \), and Sofie has as \( S \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \)
2. \( S = A + 25 \)
3. \( A = F - 12 \)

First, we can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation to find \( F \).

From the third equation, we can express \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ A = F - 12 \]

From the second equation, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( A \):
\[ S = A + 25 \]
Substituting \( A = F - 12 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \]

Now, we substitute \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \( 28 \) books.

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item category:

1. **Bacon**: Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total. So, the cost per pack of bacon is:
   \[
   \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]

2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. So, the cost per packet of chicken is:
   \[
   2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet}
   \]
   Since she has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost for chicken is:
   \[
   6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4. Since she has 3 packs, the total cost for strawberries is:
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Apples**: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. So, the cost per pack of apples is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]
   Since she has 7 packs of apples, the total cost for apples is:
   \[
   7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[
10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars}

To find the total number of chimichangas made on these three days, we add the number of chimichangas made each day:

125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday) = 500 chimichangas.

The final numerical answer is:
500"
"First, we need to determine how many microphones will not find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. Given that 20% of the 50 microphones won't fit, we calculate 20% of 50:

\[ 20\% \times 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 microphones won't find any space to fit in. This means that the remaining microphones that can be paired are:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of microphones can be made from these 40 microphones. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we divide 40 by 2:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged on the stage is:

20

So, the final numerical answer is:

20"
"Jerry counts six birds nesting in the bushes. 

2/3 of that number of birds flying overhead is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \]

He also counts 3 groups of eight birds each feeding, which is:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Adding all these together, the total number of birds Jerry counts is:
\[ 6 + 4 + 24 = 34 \]

Total number of birds: 34"
"Lani started with 55 cookies and ate 5, so she had:

\[ 55 - 5 = 50 \]

Now, she placed the remaining 50 cookies equally into 5 jars. To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we divide 50 by 5:

\[ 50 \div 5 = 10 \]

So, there were 10 cookies in each jar."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids and the daisies.

For the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals on the orchids is \(5 \times 5 = 25\).

For the daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals on the daisies is \(4 \times 10 = 40\).

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of orchid petals from the total number of daisy petals:
- The difference in the number of petals is \(40 - 25 = 15\).

So, the daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids."
"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants:

\[ \text{Outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. To find the number of flowering plants, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, 25% of the plants are flowering plants."
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first determine the speed of the thingamabob and then use that to find the speed of the whirligig.

Given:
- A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.
- A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob.

From this, we can find the speed of the thingamabob:
\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ m/s}}{11} = 11 \text{ m/s} \]

Now, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob:
\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ m/s} = 55 \text{ m/s} \]

Therefore, the whirligig spins at 55 meters per second."
"Let's break down the costs:

1. The salad costs $6.
2. The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, so it costs $6 / 2 = $3.
3. The total cost for the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.
4. Ellen pays $11 in total for her goods, so the cost of the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.
5. Ellen eats 2 carrots a day, so the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

Therefore, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day."
"First, let's calculate Mark's new hourly wage after the raise. He used to make $10 an hour and his pay was increased by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is:

\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours he works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is:

\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week:

\[ 12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 480 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( J \).
2. According to the problem, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
3. In the following week, Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.
4. Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work each week. Therefore, the total amount Tasha earned from mowing Joe's lawn over the two weeks is \( 6J + 6J = 12J \).
5. The total earnings from mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns are \( 6 \times 3J + 6 \times 5J = 18J + 30J = 48J \).
6. The total earnings from mowing lawns and selling lemonade is $80. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   12J + 48J + \text{(lemonade sales)} = 80
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   60J + \text{(lemonade sales)} = 80
   \]
7. Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for each mowing session, and we know the total from mowing lawns is \( 60J \), we can solve for \( J \) by recognizing that the total from mowing lawns is $60 (since \( 60J = 60 \) when \( J = 1 \)). This means Tasha mowed Joe's lawn once each week, Kamala's lawn three times, and Alba's lawn five times.
8. Substituting \( J = 1 \) into the equation, we get:
   \[
   60 \times 1 + \text{(lemonade sales)} = 80
   \]
   \[
   60 + \text{(lemonade sales)} = 80
   \]
   \[
   \text{(lemonade sales)} = 80 - 60 = 20
   \]

Therefore, Tasha made \(\boxed{20}\) dollars from lemonade sales."
"Martin's weight is 55 kg.

Carl’s weight is 16 kg more than Martin’s weight, so Carl’s weight is 55 kg + 16 kg = 71 kg.

Christian’s weight is 8 kg more than Carl’s weight, so Christian’s weight is 71 kg + 8 kg = 79 kg.

Harry is 5 kg less than Christian’s weight, so Harry’s weight is 79 kg - 5 kg = 74 kg.

The weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"To calculate John's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out each month.

"First, let's determine how many notebooks Martha originally had. Since Martha ended up with 7 notebooks after buying 5 more, she originally had:

\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

Now, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. So, Joseph had:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

Each of Susan’s nephews will get 16 cookies."
"Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages.

Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.

So, the total number of pages Denise read is \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.

Daniel did not read any pages today, so his total remains \(13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract Daniel's total from Denise's total: \(28 - 13 = 15\).

Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the total amount of soup Calvin has in terms of bowls.

Calvin's pot can fill:
- 4 adult bowls
- 8 child bowls

Since Calvin and his wife are both adults, they will each have 1 adult bowl, which totals 2 adult bowls for the adults. This leaves us with 2 adult bowls worth of soup for the children (4 total adult bowls - 2 adult bowls for Calvin and his wife = 2 adult bowls for the children).

Since 8 child bowls are equivalent to 2 adult bowls, we can find out how many child bowls are equivalent to 1 adult bowl by dividing 8 by 2, which gives us 4 child bowls per adult bowl.

Therefore, the 2 adult bowls of soup are equivalent to:
2 adult bowls * 4 child bowls/adult bowl = 8 child bowls

Calvin has 8 child bowls of soup left after the adults have eaten.

Calvin has 2 children, and each child will have 1 bowl of soup for lunch. So, the total number of bowls the children will eat is 2.

To find out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we divide the total number of child bowls by the number of children:
8 child bowls / 2 children = 4 times

Each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 4 times from the leftover soup.

"To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can calculate the material required for each type of mask separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the material needed for 20 small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 small mask, she needs \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards of material.
- For 20 small masks, she would need \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards of material.

Next, let's calculate the material needed for 8 large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 large mask, she needs \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards of material.
- For 8 large masks, she would need \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards of material.

Now, we add the material needed for the small and large masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

So, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tickets Deepa has seen.
2. Divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets to find the average price per ticket.

First, let's calculate the total number of tickets Deepa has seen. Since there are 9 Fast and the Furious movies and she has seen each one 3 times, the total number of tickets is:

\[ 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ tickets} \]

Next, we know that she spent $216 in total. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

\[ \frac{216 \text{ dollars}}{27 \text{ tickets}} = 8 \text{ dollars per ticket} \]

So, the average price she paid per ticket is:

"To find out how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his activities and subtract that from the total hours in a day.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up the time spent on these activities:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Walk the dog: 1 hour

Total time spent on activities = 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours

There are 24 hours in a day. So, the free time Harold has left in his day is:
24 - 19 = 5 hours

Therefore, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day."
"Tim starts with 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes.

He uses 3 blue shoe boxes, so the number of blue shoe boxes left is:
7 - 3 = 4 blue shoe boxes.

He uses 1/3 of his red shoe boxes, so the number of red shoe boxes used is:
1/3 * 9 = 3 red shoe boxes.

Therefore, the number of red shoe boxes left is:
9 - 3 = 6 red shoe boxes.

So, the total number of shoe boxes left in Tim's box is:
4 blue + 6 red = 10 shoe boxes.

Final numerical answer:

"Duncan's current age is 60. Eight years ago, Duncan was 60 - 8 = 52 years old.

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as \( A \). According to the problem, eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, we can write the equation:

\[ 52 = 2A \]

Solving for \( A \):

\[ A = \frac{52}{2} = 26 \]

So, Adam was 26 years old four years ago. Therefore, Adam's current age is:

\[ 26 + 4 = 30 \]

To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
2. Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
3. Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
4. There were 20 red balloons.

First, we calculate the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons:
\[ 20 \text{ red balloons} \times 2 \text{ pieces per red balloon} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we subtract the number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons from the total number of bologna pieces to find out how many pieces were thrown at the yellow balloons:
\[ 58 \text{ total pieces} - 40 \text{ pieces for red balloons} = 18 \text{ pieces for yellow balloons} \]

Now, we know that each yellow balloon received 3 pieces of bologna. To find the number of yellow balloons, we divide the number of bologna pieces for yellow balloons by the number of pieces per yellow balloon:
\[ \frac{18 \text{ pieces}}{3 \text{ pieces per yellow balloon}} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

Therefore, the number of yellow balloons is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, which totals:

100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the interval for a tune-up:

3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: Since 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, we can calculate the cost as follows:
   - Cost for 2 balloons = $0.5
   - Cost for 1 balloon = $0.5 / 2 = $0.25
   - Cost for 12 balloons = $0.25 * 12 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each = $7 * 2 = $14

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to cover these expenses, the total amount they had together is $28. Since they had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total by 2 to find out how much each girl received from their mother.

- Allowance per girl = Total amount / 2
- Allowance per girl = $28 / 2 = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14."

"To find the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the calories in one mini cinnamon roll.
2. Calculate the total calories for all mini cinnamon rolls.
3. Calculate the calories in one mini blueberry muffin.
4. Calculate the total calories for all mini blueberry muffins.
5. Add the total calories from both types of pastries to get the final answer.

Step 1: A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. Since a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, the calories in one mini cinnamon roll are:
\[ \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Step 2: Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls. The total calories for all mini cinnamon rolls are:
\[ 200 \times 200 = 40,000 \text{ calories} \]

Step 3: A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. Since a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, the calories in one mini blueberry muffin are:
\[ \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories} \]

Step 4: Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins. The total calories for all mini blueberry muffins are:
\[ 300 \times 150 = 45,000 \text{ calories} \]

Step 5: The total calories for all the pastries are:
\[ 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 \text{ calories} \]

Therefore, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is:
\[ \boxed{85000} \]"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

1. On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
2. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, so that's \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs each day.
3. On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
4. On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's sum up the total number of Junebugs removed:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Adding these together:

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we need to find the average number of Junebugs removed per day. There are 5 days in the week (Monday to Friday), so we divide the total by 5:

\[
\frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

For the bus:
- Speed = 60 miles per hour
- Time = 5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

For the car:
- Speed = 30 miles per hour
- Time = 8 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, to find out how much farther the bus went than the car:
- Difference in distance = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of all the other toys and then subtract that total from the overall number of toys Sophie has.

1. The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
2. The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
3. The tower of stacking rings has 9 rings.
4. The total number of toys is 62.

First, we add up the number of building blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Next, we subtract this sum from the total number of toys to find out how many bouncy balls there are:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

So, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: \( P + Pa + J = 100 \).
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: \( Pa = J + 10 \).
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: \( P = Pa + J \).

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we have \( J \), we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is \( 50 \) years.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Maria invited 4 friends, so there are 4 + 1 (Maria) = 5 people in total.
2. Maria gave each of her friends 2 water balloons, so that's 4 friends * 2 balloons = 8 balloons.
3. Maria had 1 water balloon for herself.
4. Then, her mom gave each person 3 more balloons, so that's 5 people * 3 balloons = 15 balloons.

Now, let's add up all the balloons:
- Initial balloons given by Maria: 8 + 1 (for herself) = 9 balloons.
- Additional balloons given by her mom: 15 balloons.

Total balloons = 9 + 15 = 24 balloons.

The girls had a total of 24 balloons."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated and already owned by the charity group.

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so the total number of donated boxes is:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

Adding the 10 boxes they already have:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Each table can fit 2 boxes, so the total number of tables needed to fit all the boxes is:
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

Since they already own 15 tables, the number of new tables they need is:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ tables} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"To find the average total distance spat, we first need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then find the average of these distances.

For Zoey:
- Number of seeds: 40
- Distance per seed: 10 feet
- Total distance spat by Zoey: \(40 \times 10 = 400\) feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds: 35
- Distance per seed: 12 feet
- Total distance spat by Sydney: \(35 \times 12 = 420\) feet

Now, we find the average total distance spat by both:
- Total distance spat by both: \(400 + 420 = 820\) feet
- Number of people: 2

Average total distance spat: \(\frac{820}{2} = 410\) feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of widgets each machine produces in a month.
2. Calculate the revenue from selling the widgets for each machine.
3. Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of widgets produced in a month.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 60
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days per month: 30
  - Total widgets per month = 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 43,200 widgets

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 45
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days per month: 30
  - Total widgets per month = 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 32,400 widgets

**Step 2: Calculate the revenue from selling the widgets.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Total revenue = 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Total revenue = 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

**Step 3: Find the difference in revenue.**

- Difference in revenue = Revenue from Widgeteer 3000 - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000
- Difference in revenue = $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

Therefore, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. This means he will stay for a total of 17 hours.

First, he pays for the initial 12-hour stay at 1000 pesos.

The remaining time is 17 - 12 = 5 hours.

For each additional hour after the 12-hour mark, he pays 70 pesos. So for 5 additional hours, he would pay 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost for Cameron's stay with the additional hours is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

If he had paid for a 24-hour stay, it would cost 1600 pesos.

The amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour plus additional hours option is 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

Cameron would save 250 pesos."
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, twice that amount is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pounds. Therefore, each sheep needs \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds of hay.

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. With 15 goats, the total hay needed for the goats is \(15 \times 5 = 75\) pounds.

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. With 12 sheep, the total hay needed for the sheep is \(12 \times 7 = 84\) pounds.

Finally, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs: \(75 + 84 = 159\) pounds.

Therefore, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay."
"First, let's calculate how much John earned in the week. He earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:

\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to account for the expenses. John spends $50 on gas, so his remaining money is:

\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John also wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so his remaining money after the deposit is:

\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to subtract the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs $10 and he buys 5 pencils, so the total cost for the pencils is:

\[ 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} \times 5 \text{ pencils} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from his remaining money gives:

\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many $25 pens he can buy with the remaining $100. The number of pens he can buy is:

\[ \frac{100 \text{ dollars}}{25 \text{ dollars/pen}} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled out. Craig has spelled out 20 words, each with 15 letters. So, the total number of letters Craig has spelled is:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled is:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the number of letters Craig has spelled to the number of letters his brother has spelled:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

So, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

\[ 650 \]"
"To find the total number of children in the drill, we need to calculate the number of children in one row and then multiply that by the total number of rows.

Each row has 8 children, and there are 7 rows per school. Since there are 5 different schools, the total number of rows is:

\[ 7 \text{ rows/school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 35 \text{ rows} \]

Now, since each row has 8 children, the total number of children is:

\[ 8 \text{ children/row} \times 35 \text{ rows} = 280 \text{ children} \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the drill is 280."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming all her coupons. Since each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice and she has 9 coupons, the total number of bottles is:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself."
"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing, we need to consider the fixed visit charge, the labor charge, and the cost of parts.

1. **Fixed Visit Charge**: $40
2. **Labor Charge**: $35 per hour, and since the job took 2.25 hours, we round up to 3 hours (as part of an hour is charged as a full hour). So, the labor charge is $35 * 3 = $105.
3. **Parts Cost**: $60

Now, we add these amounts together:

\[ \text{Total Charge} = \text{Fixed Visit Charge} + \text{Labor Charge} + \text{Parts Cost} \]
\[ \text{Total Charge} = 40 + 105 + 60 \]
\[ \text{Total Charge} = 205 \]

So, Patty charged $205 for the job."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount:

10 CDs * $15/CD = $150

Now, let's apply the 40% discount:

40% of $150 = 0.40 * $150 = $60

So, the discounted price for the 10 CDs is:

$150 - $60 = $90

Next, we need to account for the 5 CDs that James doesn't like and sells for $40 each:

5 CDs * $40/CD = $200

Now, we subtract the money he got from selling the 5 CDs from the total amount he spent:

$90 - $200 = -$110

Since the result is negative, it means James actually gained $110, not that he was out any money. However, the question asks how much money he was ""out,"" which implies a loss. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that he was not out any money, but rather gained $110.

Final numerical answer:
$110"
"To calculate how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to multiply the quantity of each type of root crop by its respective price and then sum up the totals.

2. For sweet potatoes: \(10 \text{ sweet potatoes} \times \$2 \text{ per sweet potato} = \$20\)
3. For carrots: \(4 \text{ carrots} \times \$1.25 \text{ per carrot} = \$5\)

Now, we add up the totals from each type of root crop:

\(\$9 + \$20 + \$5 = \$34\)

Therefore, if Jen sells everything, she will earn \(\$34\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. Calculate the distance James swims initially.
2. Determine the time it takes to swim that distance.
3. Calculate the time he rests.
4. Determine the remaining distance and the new swimming speed.
5. Calculate the time it takes to swim the remaining distance.
6. Sum up all the times to get the total time.

Let's go through each step:

1. **Distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Time to swim the initial distance:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Rest time:**
   He rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Remaining distance:**
   The remaining distance is the total distance minus the distance already swum.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **New swimming speed:**
   He swims at half the original speed.
   \[
   \text{New speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

6. **Time to swim the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Total time:**
   Sum up all the times.
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours."

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \) (total points scored by the team)
2. \( B = A + 20 \) (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)
3. \( B = D + 10 \) (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)

We can use the second equation to express \( A \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]

And the third equation to express \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Now, substitute these expressions into the first equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 25 \) back into the expression for \( A \):
\[ A = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."

"To find out how many reports Vince stapled, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports.
2. Determine how many 15-minute intervals are in that total time.
3. Multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports he can staple in each interval.

First, let's calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and stopped at 11:00 PM. 

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we convert 15 hours into minutes:
15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Now, we determine how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
900 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals

Since Vince can staple 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports he can staple in each interval:
60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and then subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Calculate the usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - Convert 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Determine the actual wake-up time:**
   - Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m., but this day she woke up 5 minutes earlier.
   - So, her wake-up time was 5:55 a.m.

3. **Calculate the time Kim was awake before sleepwalking:**
   - From 2:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 3 hours and 40 minutes.
   - Convert 3 hours and 40 minutes to minutes: \(3 \times 60 + 40 = 220\) minutes.

4. **Calculate the time Kim was sleepwalking:**
   - From 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. is 23 minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time Kim was awake:**
   - Total awake time = Time awake before sleepwalking + Time sleepwalking
   - Total awake time = 220 minutes + 23 minutes = 243 minutes

6. **Calculate the time Kim was actually asleep:**
   - Usual sleep duration = 480 minutes
   - Subtract the total awake time from the usual sleep duration
   - Time asleep = 480 minutes - 243 minutes = 237 minutes

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 237 minutes that day."

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

Over the course of 2 weeks (14 days), 50 patients are admitted each day. Therefore, the total number of new admissions in 2 weeks is:

\[ \text{Total new admissions} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

After 2 weeks, the total number of occupied beds will be the initial occupied beds plus the new admissions:

\[ \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

\[ \text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

"Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the remainder is:

16 - 7 = 9 emails.

Two-thirds of these 9 emails are to family. So, the number of emails to family is:

(2/3) * 9 = 6 emails.

The remaining emails, which are not to family, are:

9 - 6 = 3 emails.

One-third of these remaining 3 emails are to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails to her boyfriend is:

(1/3) * 3 = 1 email.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

1 email/day"
"If Aliya is 3 years old, and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, then Shawna is:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, Shawna's father is:

\[ 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"If Courtney overstated the number of people by 20%, we can set up the following relationship:

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people who attended the concert.

According to Kelly, Courtney's reported number (48) is 120% of the actual number of people (since 100% + 20% = 120%).

So, we can write the equation as:
\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"To solve this problem, let's define the number of balls each boy carried in terms of Jeffrey's number of balls.

Let \( J \) represent the number of balls Jeffrey carried. According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by all three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each boy:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

Now, we can find the total number of balls:
\[ 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, let's first calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day, including the two holes they filled in.

- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes, but they filled in 2 holes, so the net increase is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes

Adding these up, the total number of holes by the end of the third day is:
\[10 + 13 + 6 = 29\]

According to the problem, by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day was 10. Therefore, the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is:
\[4 \times 10 = 40\]

To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we subtract the number of holes at the end of the third day from the number of holes at the end of the fourth day:
\[40 - 29 = 11\]

So, the pirates dug \(\boxed{11}\) holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure."
"Let's denote the number of corn chips that Collins received as \( C \).

Since Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, the total number of corn chips they received is:
\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]

Collins received 15 more corn chips than each of Amora and Lainey, so:
\[ C = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ 140 + 85 = 225 \]

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is:
225"
"To find out how much the travel costs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, which is 50% more than the supplies.

The cost of supplies is $400. 

50% of $400 is calculated as:
\[ 400 \times \frac{50}{100} = 400 \times 0.5 = 200 \]

So, the total cost of the tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the travel costs:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( X + S + A = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, we can substitute the expression for \( X \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (S + 5) + S + A = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A = 334 \]

Next, we substitute the expression for \( S \) from the third equation into the equation above:
\[ 2(4A - 13) + A = 334 \]
\[ 8A - 26 + A = 334 \]
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we have \( A \), we can find \( S \):
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught \(\boxed{147}\) Pokemon."
"Each episode is 20 minutes long. There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, so there are 20 / 2 = 10 episodes in total.

To find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

10 episodes * 20 minutes/episode = 200 minutes

John will spend 200 minutes watching the show."
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird flew in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction.

1. The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour:
   \[ 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

2. The bird then flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour:
   \[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \]

3. Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour:
   \[ 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the distances flown in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction:
\[ 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

The distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[ \boxed{374} \text{ miles} \]"
"Greta initially made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 12 brownies.

At her office party, she received an additional 1/2 dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.

When she arrived home, there were 4 dozen brownies waiting, which is 48 brownies.

So, the total number of brownies Greta had before the surprise party is:
12 (initial batch) + 6 (from office) + 48 (from friends) = 66 brownies.

During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. Since 1 dozen is 12 brownies, 1 1/2 dozen is 18 brownies.

The number of brownies left over is:
66 (total) - 18 (eaten) = 48 brownies.

Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day."
"Nani is 8 years old.

His brother is twice Nani's age, so the brother is \(8 \times 2 = 16\) years old.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find 25% of Nani's age, we calculate \(8 \times 0.25 = 2\). So, the sister is \(8 - 2 = 6\) years old.

The total age of all three family members is \(8 + 16 + 6 = 30\).

30"
"To find out how long it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the total time for each type of string and then sum them up.

1. For the 3 racquets strung with synthetic gut:
   - Time per racquet: 15 minutes
   - Total time: 3 * 15 = 45 minutes

2. For the 5 racquets strung with polyester string:
   - Time per racquet: 22 minutes
   - Total time: 5 * 22 = 110 minutes

3. For the 4 racquets strung with a hybrid set:
   - Time per racquet: 18 minutes
   - Total time: 4 * 18 = 72 minutes

Now, we add up the total time for all racquets:
- Total time: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes

Therefore, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all of the racquets."
"John is buying phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which makes a total of 4 phones.

The first 2 phones are at full price, which is $600 each. So, the cost for the first 2 phones is:
2 phones * $600/phone = $1200

The remaining 2 phones are at half price, which is $600 / 2 = $300 each. So, the cost for the remaining 2 phones is:
2 phones * $300/phone = $600

Adding the cost of the first 2 phones and the remaining 2 phones together, we get the total cost:
$1200 + $600 = $1800

Therefore, John paid $1800 for all the phones."
"To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. 

Given that Carlton's team has 13 players and Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = \text{Number of players on Carlton's team} + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 13 + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 20 \]

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

\[ \text{Total number of players} = \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} + \text{Number of players on Carlton's team} \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 20 + 13 \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is 33."
"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of slats} = 100 \]

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"Mrs. Harrington initially bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave away 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes given away. Therefore, she had 12 - 4 = 8 boxes left.

She kept 1/4 of the remaining 8 boxes for herself. So, she kept 8 * 1/4 = 2 boxes.

This means she sold the rest, which is 8 - 2 = 6 boxes.

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the number of oranges she sold is 6 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 120 oranges.

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges."
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, the number of states in India can be represented as \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India, which is \( x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \).

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \).

Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is 79."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy:

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Tyler has already saved $14, so we need to find out how much more money he needs:

Amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour, so to find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide the amount needed by his hourly wage:

Hours needed = Amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5

Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Robert has 30 cherries.
2. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, so Richard has \(30 - 10 = 20\) cherries.
3. The total number of cherries is 60. If we add up the cherries that Robert and Richard have, we get \(30 + 20 = 50\) cherries.
4. This means Jerry has \(60 - 50 = 10\) cherries.
5. Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries, so Robert has \(30 - 10 = 20\) more cherries than Jerry.

Final numerical answer:
\[
20

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of boxes sold on each day:**

   - **Saturday:**
     - Gingerbread: 10 boxes
     - Apple pie: 4 fewer boxes than on Sunday, so we need to find out how many boxes were sold on Sunday first.

   - **Sunday:**
     - Gingerbread: 5 more boxes than on Saturday, so \(10 + 5 = 15\) boxes
     - Apple pie: 15 boxes

   - **Saturday (revisited):**
     - Apple pie: Since Sunday's sales were 15 boxes of apple pie and it was 4 more than Saturday, then Saturday's sales were \(15 - 4 = 11\) boxes of apple pie.

2. **Calculate the total earnings for each day:**

   - **Saturday:**
     - Gingerbread: \(10 \text{ boxes} \times \$6 = \$60\)
     - Apple pie: \(11 \text{ boxes} \times \$15 = \$165\)
     - Total for Saturday: \(\$60 + \$165 = \$225\)

   - **Sunday:**
     - Gingerbread: \(15 \text{ boxes} \times \$6 = \$90\)
     - Apple pie: \(15 \text{ boxes} \times \$15 = \$225\)
     - Total for Sunday: \(\$90 + \$225 = \$315\)

3. **Calculate the total earnings for both days:**

   - Total earnings: \(\$225 + \$315 = \$540\)

Therefore, Sunny earned a total of \$540 for the two days."
"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of sunscreen Pamela will use over the 8 days.
2. Determine how many bottles are required based on the total usage.

First, we calculate the total amount of sunscreen used per day:
- Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour.
- She will be outside for 4 hours a day.
- Therefore, she uses \(1 \, \text{ounce/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours/day} = 4 \, \text{ounces/day}\).

Next, we calculate the total amount of sunscreen used over 8 days:
- She uses 4 ounces of sunscreen per day.
- Over 8 days, she will use \(4 \, \text{ounces/day} \times 8 \, \text{days} = 32 \, \text{ounces}\).

Now, we determine how many bottles are needed:
- Each bottle contains 8 ounces of sunscreen.
- To find out how many bottles are needed, we divide the total ounces by the ounces per bottle: \(32 \, \text{ounces} \div 8 \, \text{ounces/bottle} = 4 \, \text{bottles}\).

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. If the blue car costs $100, we can calculate the price of the red car as follows:

40% of $100 is calculated as:
\[ 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \]

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. Therefore, the price of the red car is:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the blue car and the red car:
\[ 100 + 60 = 160 \]

Both cars cost a total of $160."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Emil is currently 19 years old.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years from now.
3. At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.
4. At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

Now, we need to find the current ages of Emil's dad and brother.

- Emil's dad will be 48 years old in 5 years, so his current age is 48 - 5 = 43 years old.
- Emil's brother will be 12 years old in 5 years, so his current age is 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother is 43 + 7 = 50.

Therefore, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 50."
"Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.

Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, which means her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.

Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which means her friend gave her 20 * 2 = 40 beads.

To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we add the beads from her mother, sister, and friend:

20 (from mother) + 30 (from sister) + 40 (from friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount of Thursday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) pounds.

The total amount of crawfish caught over the three days is \(3 + 12 + 6 = 21\) pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, the number of servings Joe has is \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) servings.

Therefore, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish."
"First, let's calculate the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Since 20% of the class are football players, we can find this number by calculating 20% of 30 students:

\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 football players.

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after accounting for the football players:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We can find this number by calculating 25% of 24:

\[ 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

Now, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is:

12"
"If Sophie wears size 5 boots, then Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, which means Charlie wears size \(5 \times 5 = 25\) boots.

To find the average size of the shoes worn by the two, we add their sizes together and divide by 2:

\[
\text{Average size} = \frac{5 + 25}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
\]

The average size of shoe worn by the two is 15."
"To determine how many additional flowers Pat needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them. Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Therefore, the total space required for each plant is:

\[1 \text{ foot (plant)} + 1.5 \text{ feet (space)} = 2.5 \text{ feet}\]

Next, we need to find out how many plants can fit in the 111 feet long flower bed. We do this by dividing the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each plant:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means Pat can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional flowers she needs to buy is:

\[44 - 17 = 27\]

Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:

\[27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, Pat will spend \(\boxed{162}\) dollars at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, so we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9 \text{ pretzels per day} \]

To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"To determine how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost for each type of plant and then sum these costs.

First, let's calculate the cost for the petunias:
- Each basket needs 3 petunias.
- There are 5 baskets.
- Each petunia costs $3.00.

The total number of petunias needed is:
\[ 3 \text{ petunias/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 15 \text{ petunias} \]

The total cost for the petunias is:
\[ 15 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00/\text{petunia} = \$45.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the sweet potato vines:
- Each basket needs 2 sweet potato vines.
- There are 5 baskets.
- Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.

The total number of sweet potato vines needed is:
\[ 2 \text{ vines/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 10 \text{ vines} \]

The total cost for the sweet potato vines is:
\[ 10 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50/\text{vine} = \$25.00 \]

Now, we add the costs of the petunias and the sweet potato vines to find the total cost:
\[ \$45.00 + \$25.00 = \$70.00 \]

Therefore, Katherine will spend \(\$70.00\) filling all 5 hanging baskets."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers, so the total soil used for sunflowers is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations, so the total soil used for carnations is \(10 \times 1.5 = 15\) pounds.

Now, let's add the soil used for sunflowers and carnations to find the total soil used for these plants: \(12 + 15 = 27\) pounds.

The total bag of soil is 30 pounds, so the remaining soil for planting roses is \(30 - 27 = 3\) pounds.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is equal to the remaining soil, which is 3 pounds.

Therefore, they can plant 3 roses.

"First, we need to calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times 2000 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with the $500.00 she sets aside each month. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

\[ \text{Number of shoes per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \]

Since she can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0.5 pairs per month, which means she can buy 1 pair every 2 months.

Now, we need to find out how many pairs she can buy in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

\[ \text{Number of pairs per year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months per pair}} = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time it takes for Emily to both peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp:
- Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
- To peel 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{6} = 15 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to sauté 90 shrimp:
- Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- To sauté 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{30} \times 10 = 3 \times 10 = 30 \) minutes.

Since peeling and sautéing are sequential tasks, we add the time for each task:
- Total time = Time to peel + Time to sauté = 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

45 minutes"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the temperature changes in the room over the given time periods and then sum them up to find the final temperature difference from the starting temperature.

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - Cooling rate: 2 degrees per hour
   - Total cooling: \(2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 6 \, \text{degrees}\)

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - Cooling rate: 3 degrees per hour
   - Total cooling: \(3 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 12 \, \text{degrees}\)

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - Warming rate: 2 degrees per hour
   - Total warming: \(2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{degrees}\)

Now, we sum up the total cooling and total warming:

- Total cooling: \(6 \, \text{degrees} + 12 \, \text{degrees} = 18 \, \text{degrees}\)
- Total warming: \(4 \, \text{degrees}\)

The net change in temperature is the total cooling minus the total warming:

- Net change: \(18 \, \text{degrees} - 4 \, \text{degrees} = 14 \, \text{degrees}\)

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley as \(D\).
2. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. So, Bill's age when he saw the comet the second time is \(3D\).
3. The time between the two sightings of the comet is 75 years, so the difference in age between Bill and his dad when Bill saw the comet the second time is 75 years. Therefore, \(3D - D = 75\).
4. Simplifying the equation, we get \(2D = 75\), so \(D = 37.5\). This means Bill's dad was 37.5 years old when he saw the comet.
5. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was \(3 \times 37.5 = 112.5\) years old.
6. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, the time between the first and second sighting for Bill is 75 years. Therefore, Bill was \(112.5 - 75 = 37.5\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, Bill was 37.5 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each type of payment and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill**: He writes one check per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes \(12 \times 1 = 12\) checks for the electric bill per year.
2. **Gas bill**: He writes one check per month. Again, there are 12 months in a year, so he writes \(12 \times 1 = 12\) checks for the gas bill per year.
3. **Church**: He writes two checks per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes \(12 \times 2 = 24\) checks for the church per year.
4. **Pest and lawn service**: He writes one check every quarter. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes \(4 \times 1 = 4\) checks for the pest and lawn service per year.

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52\]

Therefore, Buford writes \(\boxed{52}\) checks per year."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips each day. These trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes, so the first plane makes \(44 \times 2 = 88\) trips each day.

2. Out of these 88 trips, three-quarters of the flights are to Greece. So, the number of flights to Greece is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66\).

3. The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The remaining flights are \(88 - 66 = 22\). Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is \(\frac{22}{2} = 11\).

Therefore, the first plane takes \(\boxed{11}\) flights to France in one day."
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we can start by calculating the duration of each wolf's howl.

1. Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds.
3. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Now, we add up the total howling time for all three wolves:
\[20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds}\]

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[120 \div 60 = 2 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and then subtract that from the total cost of the trousers.

1. Adam's mother gave him $6.
2. Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.
3. The total amount of money given by his parents is \(6 + 12 = 18\) dollars.
4. The trousers cost $30.

Now, we subtract the total amount given by his parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings.

\(30 - 18 = 12\)

Adam had to contribute \(\boxed{12}\) dollars from his savings."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(Al\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
- \(A = 3\)
- \(Al = 4\)
- The total age of the children is 20, so \(A + Al + H + W = 20\).
- Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, so \(H = 2 \times \frac{A + Al + H + W}{4}\).

First, substitute the known values into the total age equation:
\[3 + 4 + H + W = 20\]
\[7 + H + W = 20\]
\[H + W = 13\]

Next, substitute the known values into the equation for Helene's age:
\[H = 2 \times \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times \frac{7 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = \frac{2(7 + H + W)}{4}\]
\[H = \frac{14 + 2H + 2W}{4}\]
\[4H = 14 + 2H + 2W\]
\[2H = 14 + 2W\]
\[H = 7 + W\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(H + W = 13\)
2. \(H = 7 + W\)

Substitute the second equation into the first:
\[7 + W + W = 13\]
\[7 + 2W = 13\]
\[2W = 6\]
\[W = 3\]

So, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the total amount of money collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund. This is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Walter's friend then donates $200. So, the total amount collected before the lawyer's contribution is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Walter's lawyer is going to donate three times as much as everyone else has donated. The total amount donated by everyone else is $2200. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution will be 3 * $2200 = $6600.

So, the lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

There are 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices is \( 2 + 4 = 6 \).

The total size of the watermelon can be represented as the sum of all the slices:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

The size of each adult's slice is \( 2x \), and to find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of each adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his activities and subtract this from the nine hours he has available.

1. Time spent on inpatient rounds:
   - He has 9 inpatients.
   - Each round takes 20 minutes.
   - Total time for rounds = 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes.

2. Time spent on appointments:
   - He has 10 appointments.
   - Each appointment takes 30 minutes.
   - Total time for appointments = 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes.

3. Total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments:
   - Total time = 180 minutes (rounds) + 300 minutes (appointments) = 480 minutes.

4. Convert the total time spent into hours:
   - 480 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 8 hours.

5. Subtract the total time spent from the 9 hours available:
   - 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

Therefore, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to work backwards from the time she wants to serve it, which is 5:00 pm.

1. Frosting the cake takes 10 minutes.
2. Cooling the cake takes 2 hours (120 minutes).
3. Baking the cake takes 30 minutes.
4. Making the cake batter takes 20 minutes.

Adding these times together:
- 10 minutes (frosting) + 120 minutes (cooling) + 30 minutes (baking) + 20 minutes (making batter) = 180 minutes

180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours.

Now, subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
- 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to have it ready to serve at 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm.

2:00 pm"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter.
2. Use the total number of chocolate bars sold to find the number of bars per box.

First, let's add the number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter:
- Lisa sold 3.5 boxes.
- Peter sold 4.5 boxes.

Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

Next, we know that together they sold 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:

Number of chocolate bars per box = Total chocolate bars / Total boxes
Number of chocolate bars per box = 64 / 8
Number of chocolate bars per box = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per session for the studio.
2. Calculate the total cost per day for the studio.
3. Calculate the total cost per week for the studio.
4. Calculate the total cost per month for the studio.

First, let's calculate the cost per session for the studio:
- The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
- The cost per student per session is $1.50.
- With 10 students, the cost per session for students is \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost per session is \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost per day for the studio:
- The studio is rented 3 days a week.
- So, the total cost per day is \(40 \times 3 = 120\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost per week for the studio:
- Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the total cost per week is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) dollars.

Finally, we calculate the total cost per month for the studio:
- The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is \(480\) dollars.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To solve this problem, we can set up equations based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( P \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( M \).

From the problem, we know:
- Peter has 4 boxes, so the total number of chocolate bars Peter has is \( 4P = 64 \).
- Martha has 7 boxes, so the total number of chocolate bars Martha has is \( 7M = 56 \).

First, we solve for \( P \) and \( M \):
\[ 4P = 64 \]
\[ P = \frac{64}{4} \]
\[ P = 16 \]

\[ 7M = 56 \]
\[ M = \frac{56}{7} \]
\[ M = 8 \]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:
\[ P - M = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"To find the number of porcupines in the park after a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of female porcupines.
2. Determine the number of baby porcupines born each month.
3. Calculate the total number of baby porcupines born in a year.
4. Add the number of baby porcupines to the initial population to get the final population.

Step 1: Calculate the number of female porcupines.
The number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population.
\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Step 2: Determine the number of baby porcupines born each month.
Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
\[ \text{Number of baby porcupines born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of baby porcupines born in a year.
There are 12 months in a year.
\[ \text{Total number of baby porcupines born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

Step 4: Add the number of baby porcupines to the initial population to get the final population.
\[ \text{Final population} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

Final numerical answer:
1490"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, so we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

So, the volume of the pool is:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"To find the total number of sticks, let's break down the information given:

1. There are 9 red sticks.
2. There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so the number of blue sticks is \(9 + 5 = 14\).
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is \(14 - 3 = 11\).

Now, to find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

\[9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34\]

Therefore, the total number of sticks is 34."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

For Matteo:
- Speed = 55 miles per hour
- Time = 4 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

For Shandy:
- Speed = 45 miles per hour
- Time = 10 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo:
- Difference in distance = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Brook Hills High School enrolls 3000 students.
- Half of these students are over 16 years old, so there are \( \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \) students over 16 years old.
- One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, so there are \( \frac{1500}{4} = 375 \) male students over 16 years old.
- The remaining students over 16 years old are female, so there are \( 1500 - 375 = 1125 \) female students over 16 years old.

Next, the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, so there are also 1500 students under 16 years old.
- One-half of the students under 16 are male, so there are \( \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \) male students under 16 years old.
- The remaining students under 16 years old are female, so there are \( 1500 - 750 = 750 \) female students under 16 years old.

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 years old and the number of female students under 16 years old:

\[ 1125 + 750 = 1875 \]

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at this school is 1875."
"Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run:

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ laps} \]

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run:
\[ 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ laps} \]

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \text{ laps} \]

Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
   - Tank's capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Water filled by Wanda on the first day = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
   - Water filled by Ms. B on the first day = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the first day = \( 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \) gallons.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water pumped by Wanda on the second day = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the second day = \( 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \) gallons.

3. **Total Water Filled:**
   - Total water filled in two days = \( 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \) gallons.

4. **Water Remaining:**

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final charge percentage to the initial charge percentage when Maria left for the park.

1. **Final Charge Calculation:**
   - After 8 hours, the power bank was at 28% charge.

2. **Charge Loss in the Last 3 Hours:**
   - For the last 3 hours, the power bank lost 7% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge percentage at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge would be \( x - 3 \times 7\% = x - 21\% \).
   - We know this equals 28%, so:
     \[
     x - 21\% = 28\%
     \]
     \[
     x = 28\% + 21\% = 49\%
     \]

3. **Charge Loss in the First 5 Hours:**
   - For the first 5 hours, the power bank lost 9% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge percentage at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge would be \( y - 5 \times 9\% = y - 45\% \).
   - We know this equals 49%, so:
     \[
     y - 45\% = 49\%
     \]
     \[
     y = 49\% + 45\% = 94\%
     \]

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%."
"First, let's calculate Janet's total earnings per hour from both wages and tips:

- Wages: $10/hour
- Tips: $15/hour

Total earnings per hour = $10 + $15 = $25/hour

Next, we calculate her weekly earnings by multiplying her hourly earnings by the number of hours she works in a week:

- Hours worked per week: 40

Weekly earnings = $25/hour * 40 hours/week = $1000/week

Now, let's determine the amount she wants to save for the down payment:

- Cost of the car: $10000
- Percentage to save: 20%

Amount to save = 20% of $10000 = 0.20 * $10000 = $2000

Finally, we calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save the down payment:

- Amount to save: $2000
- Weekly earnings: $1000/week

Number of weeks needed = $2000 / $1000/week = 2 weeks

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jamaar has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost of the items already purchased:

\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10, so the amount of money he has left after his purchases is:

\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

Each plum costs $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:

\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums."
"First, we calculate the total number of sweets Anne has:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack contains 60 pieces, so the total number of pieces she gave to her friends is:

\[ 13 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne has 10 friends, and she distributed the sweets equally among them. Therefore, the number of pieces each friend received is:

\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

Each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply the 5% annual increase to the original price of $120 for each of the three years.

1. **First Year:**
   - Increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
   - New price after first year = $120 + $6 = $126

2. **Second Year:**
   - Increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
   - New price after second year = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

3. **Third Year:**
   - Increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
   - New price after third year = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounding $138.915 to the nearest integer, we get $139.

**Final Answer:**
$139"
"Olivia uploaded 72 pictures in total and distributed them equally into 8 albums. To find out how many pictures are in each album, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

So, each album contains 9 pictures.

Out of these 8 albums, 3 are selfies only and 2 are portraits only. This means there are 3 albums with only selfies and 2 albums with only portraits. Since each of these albums contains 9 pictures, we can calculate the total number of selfies and portraits as follows:

For selfies:
\[ 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 27 \text{ selfies} \]

For portraits:
\[ 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 18 \text{ portraits} \]

Adding the number of selfies and portraits together:
\[ 27 \text{ selfies} + 18 \text{ portraits} = 45 \]

Therefore, Olivia had 45 portraits and selfies in total."
"To find out how long James spends reading, we first need to determine how long it takes him to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time per page as follows:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} \]

Now, we know he reads 18 pages. To find the total time spent reading, we multiply the time per page by the number of pages he reads:

\[ \text{Total time} = \left( \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} \right) \times 18 \text{ pages} \]

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{10 \times 18}{3} \text{ minutes} \]

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{180}{3} \text{ minutes} \]

\[ \text{Total time} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

James spends 60 minutes reading."

He picks 6 bananas on Thursday.
On Friday, he picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

To find the total number of bananas John has, we add the bananas picked each day:
4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas.

John has 22 bananas."
"First, let's break down the quiz into its components:

- Total number of questions: 60
- Percentage of easy questions: 40%
- Number of easy questions: \(60 \times 0.40 = 24\)
- Number of average and difficult questions: \(60 - 24 = 36\)
- Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided, the number of average questions is \(36 / 2 = 18\) and the number of difficult questions is also \(18\).

Next, we calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:

- Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct: \(24 \times 0.75 = 18\)
- Aries is sure to get half of the average questions correct: \(18 / 2 = 9\)
- Aries is sure to get half of the difficult questions correct: \(18 / 2 = 9\)

Now, we add up the correct answers:

- Total correct answers: \(18 + 9 + 9 = 36\)

Therefore, Aries is sure to get 36 points."
"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (L \times x) + (S \times 2x) \]
Substituting the values of \( L \) and \( S \):
\[ 120 = (12 \times x) + (4 \times 2x) \]
\[ 120 = 12x + 8x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals. Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first need to calculate the daily consumption and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

- The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
- The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
- The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

So, the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the family is:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Now, to find the total for one week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
\[ 11 \times 7 = 77 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Therefore, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"First, let's calculate the total earnings from the cookies and cupcakes.

From the cookies:
80 cookies * $1/cookie = $80

From the cupcakes:
60 cupcakes * $4/cupcake = $240

Total earnings:
$80 (from cookies) + $240 (from cupcakes) = $320

Next, we subtract the amount given to her sisters:
$320 - ($10 * 2) = $320 - $20 = $300

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings."
"The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

The total number of eggs hidden was 100, and 10 eggs were not found by anyone.

So, the number of eggs found by the friends is 100 - 60 - 10 = 30 eggs.

The friends found 30 eggs."
"First, let's determine the amount of ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day. We know that a dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is:

\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ pounds per day} \]

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. So, the amount of ore mined per day with a steel pickaxe is:

\[ 24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days, each using a steel pickaxe. The total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves in one day is:

\[ 40 \times 36 = 1440 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Over 30 days, the total amount of ore mined is:

\[ 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{43200} \]"
"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich for each package and then use that to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

First, let's calculate the price per sandwich for each package:

1. For the first package:
   - 2 sandwiches for $3
   - Price per sandwich = $3 / 2 = $1.50

2. For the second package:
   - 4 sandwiches for $6
   - Price per sandwich = $6 / 4 = $1.50

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages, which is $1.50.

Now, we can find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
- Cost = 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12."
"First, we need to determine the remaining amount Tom needs to pay after selling his old bedroom set. He buys a new one for $3000 and sells his old one for $1000, so the remaining amount is:

\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% of this remaining amount each month. To find out how much he needs to pay per month, we calculate 10% of $2000:

\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ 200 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst due to the wind. 

\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]

So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving her with:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of her 12 yellow balloons:

\[ 12 \div 2 = 6 \]

This means she has:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

yellow balloons left. 

As she neared the school, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons. 

\[ 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]

So, she added 6 blue balloons to her collection. 

Now, let's sum up all the balloons she has:

\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 6 \text{ (blue)} = 27 \]

Therefore, the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school is:

\[ 27 \]"
"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.5
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. So, the probability of not having to turn in his homework in this case is 100% or 1.

2. **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.4
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.6
   - If the normal teacher gives an extension, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. So, the probability of not having to turn in his homework in this case is 0.4.

3. **Normal Teacher without Extension, Marcus Gets a Personal Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.6
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension: 20% or 0.2
   - Probability of Marcus not getting a personal extension: 80% or 0.8
   - If Marcus does not get a personal extension, he has to turn in his homework. So, the probability of having to turn in his homework in this case is 0.8.

Now, we calculate the overall probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework by considering the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension:

- Probability of having a substitute teacher and not having to turn in homework: \(0.5 \times 1 = 0.5\)
- Probability of the normal teacher coming in, giving an extension, and not having to turn in homework: \(0.5 \times 0.4 = 0.2\)
- Probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension, and Marcus not getting a personal extension, and having to turn in homework: \(0.5 \times 0.6 \times 0.8 = 0.24\)

Adding these probabilities together gives the total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

\[0.5 + 0.2 + 0.24 = 0.94\]

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is \(94\%\)."
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats already allocated for graduates and faculty.
2. Subtract this number from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center to find out how many seats are available for tickets to be given to friends and family.
3. Divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive.

Let's do the math:

1. Seats for graduates and faculty: \(950 + 300 = 1250\)
2. Available seats for tickets: \(6000 - 1250 = 4750\)
3. Tickets per graduate: \(4750 \div \text{number of graduates}\)

Since the number of graduates is not provided, let's assume there are \(G\) graduates. The formula for tickets per graduate would be:

\[
\text{Tickets per graduate} = \frac{4750}{G}
\]

Without the exact number of graduates, we can't provide a numerical answer. However, if we assume there are 1000 graduates (as an example), then:

\[
\text{Tickets per graduate} = \frac{4750}{1000} = 4.75
\]

Since you can't give a fraction of a ticket, each graduate would receive 4 tickets, with some tickets left over.

Final numerical answer (assuming 1000 graduates):
\[
4

"To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish the relationship between the different sizes of jelly beans.

1. First, we know that 75 large jelly beans fill Grandpa up.
2. Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large jelly beans. Therefore, the number of medium-sized jelly beans he can eat is:
   \[
   2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium-sized jelly beans}
   \]
3. Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized jelly bean. Therefore, the number of small jelly beans that is equivalent to 150 medium-sized jelly beans is:
   \[
   3 \times 150 = 450 \text{ small jelly beans}
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of soda bottles Richard will place.
2. Determine the total time it will take to place all the bottles and drop the candy.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of soda bottles.**

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. This means the number of intervals between the bottles is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per bottle}} = 8 \text{ intervals} \]

Since there is a bottle at the start and one at the end of each interval, the total number of bottles is:

\[ 8 + 1 = 9 \text{ bottles} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total time to place all the bottles and drop the candy.**

Richard takes 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next. Since there are 8 intervals between 9 bottles, the total time to place all the bottles and drop the candy is:

\[ 8 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ seconds per interval} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

\[ \boxed{40 \text{ seconds}} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of apples Uncle Franky has. Since there are forty apples in one box and he ordered two boxes, we can calculate the total number of apples as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ apples/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of apples he can make if each pack contains eight apples. We do this by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:

\[ 80 \text{ apples} \div 8 \text{ apples/pack} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make \(\boxed{10}\) packs of apples."
"To find out how much money Amor will have left after buying the cheese, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and then subtract that from the $50 she started with.

First, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:
- The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound.
- Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.
- Therefore, the cost of the Parmesan cheese is \(2 \times 11 = 22\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the Mozzarella cheese:
- The price of Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
- Amor buys 3 pounds of Mozzarella cheese.
- Therefore, the cost of the Mozzarella cheese is \(3 \times 6 = 18\) dollars.

Now, let's find the total cost of the cheese:
- The total cost is the sum of the cost of the Parmesan and Mozzarella cheese.
- Therefore, the total cost is \(22 + 18 = 40\) dollars.

Finally, let's calculate how much money Amor will have left:
- Amor starts with $50.
- She spends $40 on cheese.
- Therefore, the money left is \(50 - 40 = 10\) dollars.

So, the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat is \(\boxed{10}\) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim borrowed for college, the total income he would have earned without going to college, and the total income he will earn with his college degree. Then, we can determine how long it will take for him to earn back the money he spent and lost.

1. **Calculate the total amount borrowed for college:**
   - Jim borrows $50,000 per year for 4 years.
   - Total amount borrowed = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

2. **Calculate the total income lost from not working while in school:**
   - Jim's annual income before college was $25,000.
   - Total income lost = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn back:**
   - Total amount to earn back = Total amount borrowed + Total income lost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

4. **Calculate Jim's new annual income after earning a college degree:**
   - His income is tripled, so his new annual income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000.

5. **Determine how long it will take to earn back the $300,000:**
   - Time to earn back = Total amount to earn back / New annual income = $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces he requires. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece is:
6 feet (bed length) + 2 feet = 8 feet

And the width of each fabric piece is:
8 feet (bed width) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we calculate the area of one fabric piece:
Area = length × width
Area = 8 feet × 10 feet = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
Total area = 80 square feet × 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric."

1. **Monday's Delivery:**
   - The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday's Delivery:**
   - One-fifth of Monday's delivery: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)

3. **Wednesday's Delivery:**
   - Twice as many as Tuesday's delivery: \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \)
   - 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery: \( 204 + 5 = 209 \)

4. **Total Delivery from Monday to Wednesday:**
   - Monday: 425 letters
   - Tuesday: 102 letters

   - Total cost = $65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00.

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.00."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. So, he won \(2 \times 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11\) dollars.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount won and lost:
- Total loss: $5 (first race) + $16.5 (third race) = $21.5
- Total win: $11 (second race)

Net loss: $21.5 - $11 = $10.5

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races (3):
\[ \text{Average loss} = \frac{10.5}{3} = 3.5 \]

So, the average loss per race is $3.5.

2. Determine the population of each city: Each city has 1000 people.
3. Calculate the total population: Multiply the number of cities by the population of each city. So, the total population is \(130 \times 1000 = 130,000\).

Therefore, the total population of South America, based on the given conditions, is 130,000 people."
"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we first need to calculate their current heights.

Xavier was originally 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert Xavier's original height to inches:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
Adding the growth:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was originally 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem, the second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation as:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is $420."
"To determine the total hours of work each painter put in, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days the painters worked.
2. Determine the total fraction of a day worked each day.
3. Convert the fraction of a day into hours.
4. Multiply the total hours worked per day by the number of days to get the total hours worked over the 3 weeks.
5. Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find out how many hours each painter worked.

Let's go through these steps:

1. The team worked for 3 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days is:
   \[
   3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}
   \]

2. Each painter worked \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day every day.

3. Convert \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day into hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day:
   \[
   \frac{3}{8} \times 24 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. Each painter worked 9 hours per day for 21 days, so the total hours worked by each painter is:
   \[
   9 \text{ hours/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 189 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, each painter put in \(\boxed{189}\) hours of work."
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) + 2(4) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + x + 8 = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is 10."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% of its value each year (100% - 21% = 79%).

Let's calculate the value of the car for each year:

1. **2007**: The initial value is $20,000.
2. **2008**: The value after one year of depreciation is $20,000 * 0.79 = $15,800.
3. **2009**: The value after another year of depreciation is $15,800 * 0.79 = $12,482.
4. **2010**: The value after another year of depreciation is $12,482 * 0.79 = $9,849.78.

Therefore, the price of the car in the year 2010 is $9,849.78."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to determine the number of books written in English and German.

1. Half of the 50 books are written in English:
   \[

   - Number of days: 4
   - Total distance driven: \(325 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 1300 \text{ km}\)

2. Subtract the distance driven from the total distance:
   - Total distance from San Diego to New York City: 1955 kilometers
   - Distance already driven: 1300 kilometers
   - Distance remaining: \(1955 \text{ km} - 1300 \text{ km} = 655 \text{ km}\)

Bernice still needs to drive 655 kilometers."
"Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. To find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days, we multiply the daily amount by 30:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we divide the total number of cups by 16 to find out how many gallons she drinks in 30 days:

\[ 240 \text{ cups} \div 16 \text{ cups/gallon} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"Initially, there are 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train:
120 + 20 = 140 people

At the second stop, 50 people descend, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train:
140 - 50 + 100 = 190 people

At the third stop, 80 people descend:
190 - 80 = 110 people

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is:
110 people"
"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. Tank top: $10
2. Running shorts: $10 + $5 = $15
3. Tennis shoes: $48 / 2 = $24
4. Athletic socks: $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up all the costs:

$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55

Alison spent a total of $55 on athletic gear."
"To determine the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of tiles needed.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of tiles and their price.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of tiles needed.**

Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is:
\[ 1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt} \]

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt. Therefore, the number of tiles required is:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ SqFt}}{1 \text{ SqFt/tile}} = 200 \text{ tiles} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost.**

Each tile costs $12. Therefore, the total cost for 200 tiles is:
\[ 200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12/\text{tile} = \$2400 \]

**Final Answer:**
The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor is \$2400."
"First, we need to calculate the increased monthly cost of the insurance after the accident. The normal cost is $120 a month, and it increased by 60%. 

To find the increased amount, we calculate 60% of $120:
\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the new monthly cost is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Now, to find the annual cost, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for the insurance."
"Greg uses 4 twin sheets and 1 king sheet per week. 

- For the twin beds: 4 sheets per bed * 4 beds = 16 twin sheets per week.
- For the king bed: 1 king sheet per week.

Since the machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time and 1 king set at a time, we calculate the number of loads per week:

- Twin sheets: 16 sheets / 2 sheets per load = 8 loads per week.
- King sheets: 1 sheet / 1 sheet per load = 1 load per week.

Total loads per week: 8 (twin) + 1 (king) = 9 loads per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads per year is:

9 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 468 loads/year.

Therefore, Greg does 468 loads of laundry in a year."
"Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend (Saturday and Sunday), they watch a total of 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

If they continue this pattern for 4 weeks, the total number of movies they can watch is 6 movies/weekend * 4 weekends = 24 movies.

"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so his collection increased to:
100 (previous amount) + 50 (collected last year) = 150 stickers.

This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as last year, which is:
2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Adding this year's collection to his last year's total:
150 (last year's total) + 100 (collected this year) = 250 stickers.

So, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection."
"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food consumed per day and then divide the total amount of cat food by this daily consumption.

1. Calculate the daily consumption of cat food:
   - Imma has 3 cats.
   - Each cat is fed 60 grams of food twice a day.
   - Therefore, each cat consumes \(60 \, \text{grams} \times 2 = 120 \, \text{grams}\) per day.
   - For 3 cats, the total daily consumption is \(120 \, \text{grams} \times 3 = 360 \, \text{grams}\).

2. Calculate how many days 720 grams of cat food will last:
   - Total cat food available: 720 grams.
   - Daily consumption: 360 grams.
   - Number of days the food will last: \( \frac{720 \, \text{grams}}{360 \, \text{grams/day}} = 2 \, \text{days} \).

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \(7 \times 2 = 14\) slices. 

To find the total number of slices they ate, we add the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia: \(10 + 7 + 14 = 31\).

Total slices eaten: 31"
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, we can express Betsy's part as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for the meal is the sum of both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part is 18 minutes longer, we calculate:

\[ Betsy's \ part = D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long."
"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to add up the costs for each item:

1. **Cast**: $200
2. **Doctor's Visit**: The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost for the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
3. **Painkillers**: $4 per pill for 30 pills, so the cost is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. **Parking**: $6 per hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours, so the cost is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, we add all these costs together:

$200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"First, we need to determine how many emails James receives in a day that require a response. Since 20% of the emails don't require any response, that means 80% of the emails do require a response.

80% of 80 emails is calculated as:
\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \]

So, James responds to 64 emails each day. 

To find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:
\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

Therefore, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to add up the number of classes that visited each day.

- Monday: 32 classes
- Tuesday: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes
- Wednesday: Three times as many as Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes
- Thursday: 30 classes
- Friday: 25 classes

Now, let's add these numbers together:

\[32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25\]

First, add 32 and 64:

\[32 + 64 = 96\]

Next, add 96 and 96:

\[96 + 96 = 192\]

Then, add 30:

\[192 + 30 = 222\]

Finally, add 25:

\[222 + 25 = 247\]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is:

247"
"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we first need to calculate the total score for all tests and then divide by the number of tests.

John's scores are:
- 100 on the first test
- 100 on the second test
- 100 on the third test
- 80 on the fourth test

Total score = 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

Number of tests = 4

Average score = Total score / Number of tests
Average score = 380 / 4
Average score = 95

Therefore, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate:

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. So, the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club is:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of pizzas left from the glee club's order is:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \]

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ate:

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

The football team ate 80% of their pizzas. So, the number of pizzas eaten by the football team is:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]

Therefore, the number of pizzas left from the football team's order is:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \]

Finally, the total number of pizzas left from both orders is:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 14 \]"
"Anthony is sending out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons, which means he is sending out 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons.

The cost to mail each small coupon is 5 cents, so the total cost for the small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

The cost to mail each big coupon is 15 cents, so the total cost for the big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the small and big coupons together: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert 24500 cents to dollars: 24500 cents / 100 = $245.

Therefore, Anthony spends a total of $245 on postage."
"First, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, so:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \]

So, Sidney initially ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Each sub contains 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in these 7 sub sandwiches is:

\[ 7 \times 4 = 28 \]

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. Therefore, the number of sub sandwiches remaining is:

\[ 7 - 4 = 3 \]

Sidney then ordered another three sub sandwiches, so the total number of sub sandwiches Sidney has now is:

\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \]

Each of these sub sandwiches contains 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 24 \]"
"Mr Hezekiah initially had 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. 

A quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, so:

Therefore, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks} \]

Each of these 15 trucks carried 20 tons of fertiliser, so the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:
\[ 15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ tons} \]

Total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day:

"Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. Since he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter he buys, he gets a second pound at half the price. 

The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound. Under the promotion, the second pound will cost him $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.

For 6 pounds of butter, he will buy 3 pairs of pounds (since 6 pounds can be divided into 3 pairs). Each pair will cost him $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

Therefore, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter will be 3 pairs * $6.00 per pair = $18.00.

The final cost to purchase 6 pounds of butter is $18.00."
"First, let's calculate the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- 25 classmates
- 7 girls in her dance class
- 13 family members

Total guests invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Since 4 people said they could not come, the actual number of guests attending the party is:

45 - 4 = 41

The cost to rent the theater is $125, and there is an additional $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20. So, the number of additional guests is:

41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is:

21 * $6 = $126

Adding the rental fee to the cost for the additional guests gives us the total cost:

$125 + $126 = $251

The party will cost $251."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine how much money Maggie and Riza each had initially.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, and she has $60 left. This means that the $60 is three-quarters of her initial amount. We can set up the equation to find her initial amount:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times \text{Maggie's initial amount} = 60
\]

To find Maggie's initial amount, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Maggie's initial amount} = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
\]

So, Maggie initially had $80. Since she spent a quarter of her money, she spent:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20
\]

Therefore, Maggie has $60 left.

Next, we consider Riza. Riza spent one-third of her money, and she has $60 left. This means that the $60 is two-thirds of her initial amount. We can set up the equation to find her initial amount:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times \text{Riza's initial amount} = 60
\]

To find Riza's initial amount, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Riza's initial amount} = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
\]

So, Riza initially had $90. Since she spent one-third of her money, she spent:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
\]

Therefore, Riza has $60 left.

Now, we add the remaining amounts of money that Maggie and Riza have:

\[
60 + 60 = 120
\]

So, the two of them have a total of $120 left."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys each day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.

Together, the first and second monkeys eat \(10 + 14 = 24\) bananas each day.

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas to feed the three monkeys for a week (7 days), the total number of bananas consumed by all three monkeys in a week is 315. Therefore, the number of bananas consumed by the three monkeys each day is \(315 \div 7 = 45\).

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we subtract the number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys each day:

\(45 - 24 = 21\).

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

"Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed 250 pieces. Then, he started and finished another 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed all 500 pieces of the second puzzle.

To find the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we add the pieces from both puzzles:

250 pieces (from the first puzzle) + 500 pieces (from the second puzzle) = 750 pieces

Therefore, Teddy placed 750 puzzle pieces during that hour."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 15 roses. Since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for 15 roses is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which amounts to:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost is $30 and she only has $25, she needs an additional $5 to cover the cost. The florist can only give change in quarters, and since 1 quarter is $0.25, we need to find out how many quarters make up $5:

\[ \$5 \div \$0.25/\text{quarter} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

So, Jenny needs 20 quarters to cover the additional $5. Therefore, the number of quarters she leaves with is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"

Therefore, Terry makes a total of $162.00."
"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find the difference between the time Paul boards the fourth train and the time he arrives at the station.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Departs after 30 minutes (10 + 20).

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train departs, which is 60 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Stays for 1/4 of the first train's stay time, which is 5 minutes (20 / 4).
   - Departs after 65 minutes (60 + 5).

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train departs, which is 125 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Leaves immediately after arriving, so it departs at 125 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train departs, which is 145 minutes after the first train arrives.

Paul will board the fourth train at 145 minutes after he arrives at the station. Since he arrives at the station at the start (0 minutes), he will wait 145 minutes for his train.

**Final Answer:**
145 minutes"
"Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. To find out how many toothpicks she has already saved, we multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week by the number of weeks:

\[ 10 \, \text{toothpicks/week} \times 12 \, \text{weeks} = 120 \, \text{toothpicks} \]

She needs a total of 200 toothpicks for the sculpture. To find out how many more toothpicks she needs, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total required:

\[ 200 \, \text{toothpicks} - 120 \, \text{toothpicks} = 80 \, \text{toothpicks} \]

Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, to find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

\[ \frac{80 \, \text{toothpicks}}{10 \, \text{toothpicks/week}} = 8 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take her 8 more weeks to collect the remaining 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price, which is $2000.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to calculate the difference between the original price and the price Mr. Rogers' friend paid, and then express this difference as a percentage of the original price.

\[ \text{Discount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, a single spring creates 1 jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - 1 minute = 60 seconds
   - Therefore, 4 hours = 4 × 60 × 60 = 14,400 seconds

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since 1 jellyfish is created every second, in 14,400 seconds, 1 spring will create 14,400 jellyfish.

4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If 1 spring creates 14,400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create 5 × 14,400 = 72,000 jellyfish.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
72,000 jellyfish."
"To find Frankie's score, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that Binkie's score is 90, and Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score.

First, we calculate twice Binkie's score:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Next, we add 15 to this result to find Frankie's score:
\[ 180 + 15 = 195 \]

So, Frankie's score is 195."
"James walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles (since his home is 4 miles from the store). He then walked back home, covering another 2 miles. After that, he walked the full 4 miles to the store.

The total distance James walked is 2 miles (back home) + 2 miles (to the store) + 4 miles (to the store) = 8 miles.

Since he walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, the time it took him to walk 8 miles is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles/hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

It took him 2 hours to reach the store."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from buying 10 bunches. Since each bunch averages 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas/bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we calculate the cost if Jenny had bought these bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80, so the total cost for 40 bananas is:

\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80/\text{banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since she bought 10 bunches and each bunch costs $3.00, the total cost is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00/\text{bunch} = \$30.00 \]

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:

\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Jenny saved \(\$2.00\) by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \).

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total length of the fence is 100 feet.
2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.

We can express these as equations:
\[ S + H = 100 \]
\[ H = S + 60 \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]
\[ 2S = 40 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to determine the growth rate per year. 

Given that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, we can calculate the annual growth rate as follows:

\[ \text{Annual growth rate} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \]

Now, to find out how much the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we multiply the annual growth rate by 13:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"First, let's calculate the number of each type of bike sold:

- Half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes, so \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \) Trekking bikes.
- 15% of the 300 bikes sold were BMX bikes, so \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \) BMX bikes.
- The rest of the bikes sold were MTB, so \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \) MTB bikes.

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:

- Earnings from Trekking bikes: \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \) dollars.
- Earnings from BMX bikes: \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \) dollars (since a BMX bike costs half the price of an MTB, which is \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \) dollars).
- Earnings from MTB bikes: \( 105 \times 500 = 52500 \) dollars.

Finally, we add up the earnings from all types of bikes to find the total earnings:

\[ 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = 131250 \]

Marcel earned a total of $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of bales made by the farmer and the number of bales picked up by the truck each hour, and then determine the net number of bales left in the field after 6 hours.

1. The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.
2. The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.
3. The net number of bales left in the field each hour is \(5 - 3 = 2\) bales.

Now, we calculate the total number of bales left in the field after 6 hours:

\[2 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ bales}\]

So, after 6 hours, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long. Therefore, the total time spent in classes each weekday is:

\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total time spent in classes during the weekdays is:

\[ 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on these days. First, we find \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly class time:

\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he spends this amount of time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time for the weekend is:

\[ 100 \text{ minutes} \times 2 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent in classes during the weekdays and the extra learning time on the weekend to get the total weekly learning time:

\[ 1600 \text{ minutes} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, John spends 30 hours a week learning."
"To find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped.
2. Calculate the height after the first bounce.
3. Calculate the height after the second bounce.

The initial height from which the ball is dropped is the height of the third floor, which is 24 feet.

The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. So, after the first bounce, the height will be:
\[ 24 \times \frac{2}{3} = 16 \text{ feet} \]

After the second bounce, the height will be:
\[ 16 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{32}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 10.67 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is \(\frac{32}{3}\) feet or approximately 10.67 feet.

\(\frac{32}{3}\) feet"
"The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we first need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now, if each bag is sold for $5, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag to find the total earnings:

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the Triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the Triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The Velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which means \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \) kilograms.

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the Triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate."
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of \(10 \times 8 = 80\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is \(80 \times 2 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of \(5 \times 8 = 40\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is \(40 \times 2 = 80\) square feet.

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[160 + 80 = 240\] square feet.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[\frac{240}{20} = 12\] gallons.

Finally, since each gallon costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[12 \times 12 = 144\] dollars.

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is $144."
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the probability step by step.

1. Ellen starts with a case of 12 sodas and shakes 3 of them.
2. She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas in total.
3. Ellen's brother takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. This leaves 2 shaken sodas and 7 unshaken sodas.

Now, we need to find the probability that Ellen's friend gets one of the shaken sodas from the remaining 9 sodas.

The number of shaken sodas left is 2, and the total number of sodas left is 9.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{2}{9} \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ \frac{2}{9} \times 100 = \frac{200}{9} \approx 22.22\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately 22.22%."
"To find out how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

1. The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled:
   \[ 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

2. The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is:
   \[ \frac{60 \, \text{miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \]
   After 3 hours, it will have traveled:
   \[ 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles} \]

3. Adding the distances traveled by both trains gives us the total distance between them:
   \[ 180 \, \text{miles} + 90 \, \text{miles} = 270 \, \text{miles} \]

After 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart."
"First, let's calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th. 

- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days.
- April 1st to April 19th is 19 days.

So, the total number of days is \(31 + 19 = 50\) days.

Billy takes 20% of these days off. To find out how many days he takes off, we calculate 20% of 50:

\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \text{ days} \]

So, Billy works on \(50 - 10 = 40\) days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day. Therefore, the number of people he helps per day is:

\[ 2 \text{ people/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 6 \text{ people/day} \]

Now, to find out how many people he helps in 40 days, we multiply the number of people he helps per day by the number of days he works:

\[ 6 \text{ people/day} \times 40 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ people} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry. 

First, let's calculate the number of people that the buses could carry:
- There were 12 buses.
- Each bus carried 35 people.

So, the total number of people carried by the buses is:
\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people/bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of people that the cars could carry:
- There were 20 cars.
- Each car carried 3 people.

So, the total number of people carried by the cars is:
\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people/car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Now, we add the number of people carried by the buses and the cars to find the total number of people inside the church:
\[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people inside the church is:
\[ \boxed{480} \]"
"To find out how old Jeff is, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. Mike is 24 years old.
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, so we subtract 4 from Mike's age to find Martha's age:
   \[
   24 - 4 = 20
   \]
   So, Martha is 20 years old.
3. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so we add 10 to Martha's age to find Jeff's age:
   \[
   20 + 10 = 30
   \]

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old."
"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute

Time = Distance / Speed
Time for the biggest slide = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute

Time for the second biggest slide = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time:
Difference = Time for the biggest slide - Time for the second biggest slide
Difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

It takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and two 15-minute breaks each day. 

First, let's calculate the total time for breaks and lunch per day:
- Lunch: 30 minutes
- Breaks: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes

Total time per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, Bobby's total time for lunch and breaks per day is 1 hour.

After 5 days, the total time for lunch and breaks is:
1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours

Final numerical answer:
5 hours"
"First, let's calculate how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (\text{Amber's distance} + \text{Micah's distance}) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (8 + 28) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - 36 \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Ahito ran 16 miles."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise.
2. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract this from the initial charge:
   \[
   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]
3. She then bought a frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00. The sale price of the frying pan is:
   \[
   20.00 \times (1 - 0.20) = 20.00 \times 0.80 = 16.00
   \]
4. She also bought a set of towels on sale for 10% off $30.00. The sale price of the towels is:
   \[
   30.00 \times (1 - 0.10) = 30.00 \times 0.90 = 27.00
   \]
5. Adding the sale prices of the frying pan and the towels to the remaining balance after the return:
   \[
   70.00 + 16.00 + 27.00 = 113.00
   \]

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 15:

\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90."
"If Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris, then Ben is:

\[ 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

Since Caroline is three times older than Ben, Caroline's age is:

\[ 8 \times 3 = 24 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old."
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs for her retirement and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount given her current savings rate.

1. Calculate the annual amount Lauren needs for retirement:
   - She plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   - Her current annual salary is $100,000.
   - Therefore, the annual amount needed for retirement is \( 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000 \) dollars.

2. Calculate the total amount needed for a 20-year retirement period:
   - The total amount needed is \( 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \) dollars.

3. Calculate how much Lauren saves each year:
   - She saves 20% of her current annual salary.
   - Her current annual salary is $100,000.
   - Therefore, the amount saved each year is \( 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000 \) dollars.

4. Calculate the number of years needed to save the total amount for retirement:
   - The total amount needed is $800,000.
   - She saves $20,000 each year.
   - Therefore, the number of years needed is \( \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \) years.

Since Lauren plans to save for a 20-year retirement period, and it will take her 40 years to save the required amount, she needs to work for an additional 20 years beyond her planned retirement period.

Final answer:
20 years"
"Marty starts with 100 centimeters of ribbon. He first cuts this ribbon into 4 equal parts. To find the length of each of these parts, we divide 100 by 4:

\[ \frac{100}{4} = 25 \text{ centimeters} \]

Each of these 25 centimeter parts is then divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these final parts, we divide 25 by 5:

\[ \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ centimeters} \]

So, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long."
"To find the total school population, we start by noting that 40% of the school population is 240 boys. Let's denote the total school population by \( P \).

Given:
\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ P = 600 \]

So, the total school population is 600.

Since 40% of the school population is boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of the total population:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."

$45 - $7 = $38

Therefore, your mom spent $38 at the gardening shop."
"To find the average height of the heels at the party, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total height of all the heels.
2. Divide the total height by the number of women to find the average.

First, let's calculate the total height of the heels:

- There are 3 women wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- There are 3 women wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

Adding these together, the total height of all the heels is \(12 + 6 = 18\) inches.

Next, we divide the total height by the number of women to find the average height of the heels:

- There are 6 women in total.
- The average height of the heels is \(\frac{18}{6} = 3\) inches.

Therefore, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To complete her journey of 9,300 miles in June, we need to determine how many miles per day Soledad must hike if she walks twice a day, covering 125 miles each time.

First, let's calculate the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike each day:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/time} \times 2 \text{ times/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of days in June:
\[ \text{June has 30 days} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike in June:
\[ 250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7500 \text{ miles} \]

Since Soledad's goal is to hike 9,300 miles, we need to find out how many more miles per day she must hike to reach her goal. First, we calculate the difference between her goal and her planned hike:
\[ 9300 \text{ miles} - 7500 \text{ miles} = 1800 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to find out how many additional miles per day she must hike to cover the extra 1,800 miles in 30 days:
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/day} \]"

1. Raymond starts with $21.
2. He saves an additional $11 from his allowance.
3. He spends $5 on a comic book.
4. He spends $19 on a puzzle.

First, we add the money he saved to his initial amount:
\[ 21 + 11 = 32 \]

Next, we subtract the cost of the comic book:
\[ 32 - 5 = 27 \]

Then, we subtract the cost of the puzzle:
\[ 27 - 19 = 8 \]

So, Raymond has $8 left.

**Final Answer: 8**"
"To find out how much each of the books cost, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Anna spent in total.
2. Calculate the cost of each book.

First, we know Anna's initial budget was $16 and she has $2 left after her purchase. Therefore, the total amount spent is:
\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Next, we know that Anna spent $4 before buying the 2 books today. So, the amount spent on the 2 books is:
\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Since she bought 2 books and they cost the same amount, the cost of each book is:
\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, each book cost $5."
"Last year, there were 50 students enrolled in the calligraphy class. This year, there was a 20% increase in enrollment.

To find the increase in the number of students:
20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10

So, the number of students enrolled this year is:
50 (last year's enrollment) + 10 (increase) = 60

Therefore, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60."
"To determine how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times, we first need to find the rate at which the light blinks. We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. 

First, we calculate the number of blinks per minute:
\[ \text{Blinks per minute} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Next, we use this rate to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times."
"Initially, Tate has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

After buying more fish, Tate has:
- 4 + 2 = 6 male guppies
- 7 + 1 = 8 female guppies
- 3 + 2 = 5 male goldfishes
- 5 + 3 = 8 female goldfishes

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes = 6 (guppies) + 5 (goldfishes) = 11
- Total female fishes = 8 (guppies) + 8 (goldfishes) = 16

The difference between the number of female and male fishes is:
- 16 (female) - 11 (male) = 5

Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes."
"Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.
Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so she took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.
Dior took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia, so she took 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 hours to do laundry (assuming ""well over 4 hours"" means at least 5 hours, and the smallest integer over 4 is 5, plus the additional 4 hours).

Adding up the time for all chores:
Amalia: 4 hours
Megan: 6 hours
Dior: 9 hours

Total time = 4 + 6 + 9 = 19 hours

19 hours"
"To find out how many miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the one-way distance to his parents' place.
2. Multiply the one-way distance by 2 to get the round trip distance.
3. Multiply the round trip distance by the number of visits in a month.

First, we know that John drives for 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph. The formula to calculate distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, the one-way distance is:

\[ \text{One-way distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Since he makes a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:

\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

John visits his parents twice a month, so we multiply the round trip distance by 2:

\[ \text{Total monthly distance} = 280 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 560 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, John drives 560 miles a month when visiting his parents."
"Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. Over 7 days, she will walk:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, the distance Brian will walk in 7 days is:

\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers and then determine how many toys the fifth worker must produce to meet the order.

First, let's calculate the production of the first two workers:
- Each of these workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- They work for 10 hours.
- Therefore, each of these workers produces \(6 \times 10 = 60\) toys.
- Together, they produce \(60 \times 2 = 120\) toys.

Next, let's calculate the production of the next two workers:
- Each of these workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- They work for 10 hours.
- Therefore, each of these workers produces \(4 \times 10 = 40\) toys.
- Together, they produce \(40 \times 2 = 80\) toys.

Now, let's add the production of the first four workers:
- The first two workers produce 120 toys.
- The next two workers produce 80 toys.
- Together, they produce \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys.

The total order is 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. This means that the first four workers have produced \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

Since the first four workers have produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced the remaining \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours they worked:
- The fifth worker produced 180 toys in 10 hours.
- Therefore, the fifth worker produces \(180 \div 10 = 18\) toys per hour.

Final numerical answer:
18"
"Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog. Since Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds, Elijah's first dog weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog. So, Elijah's second dog weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the total weight of all the dogs, we add the weights of Kory's dog and Elijah's two dogs:

\[ 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is 105 pounds."
"Let's work backwards from the information given:

1. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris originally had \(9 + 7 = 16\) stickers.
2. Luis gave all of his stickers to Kris, so Luis had 16 stickers before giving them to Kris.
3. Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris, so the 16 stickers he had were the other half. Therefore, Luis originally had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.
4. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Seth originally had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

Therefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of M&M that John has:

3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces

Next, we need to find out how many M&M he has in total:

30 ounces * 30 M&M per ounce = 900 M&M

Now, if he puts 10 M&M in each small bag, we can calculate the number of small bags he can make:

900 M&M / 10 M&M per small bag = 90 small bags

Therefore, John can make 90 small bags of M&M."
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we first need to calculate half of the earth's circumference.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

"To find out how fast the fastest car can go, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use that to find the speed of the fastest car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so we calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times 120 \text{ mph} = 600 \text{ mph} \]

Next, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we calculate the speed of the fastest car as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 \text{ mph} = 750 \text{ mph} \]

Therefore, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour."
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old two years ago. Therefore, Vince is now 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

Vince is now 9 years old."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted.
2. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, Madeline also painted \( A \) eggs.
3. Let \( C \) be the number of eggs Camden painted.
4. Since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, Sarah painted \( 30 - C \) eggs.
5. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so \( C = (30 - C) + 12 \).

Now, let's solve for \( C \):
\[ C = 30 - C + 12 \]
\[ 2C = 42 \]
\[ C = 21 \]

So, Camden painted 21 eggs. Since Sarah painted \( 30 - C \) eggs:
\[ \text{Sarah's eggs} = 30 - 21 = 9 \]

Now, we know the total number of eggs painted by Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah is 56. We can write the equation:
\[ A + A + C + (30 - C) = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Arnold painted 13 eggs. Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Since each group of crayons will be placed in a box, Nik will need 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. Therefore, the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Weight of crayons} = 200 \times 1 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

The total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Weight of boxes} = 25 \times 8 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

To convert the total weight from ounces to pounds, we use the conversion factor that 1 pound = 16 ounces:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400}{16} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much of the tree can be turned into logs. John can make logs out of 80% of the 80-foot tree:

\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs can be cut from the 64 feet of usable wood:

\[ \frac{64}{4} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

From each log, John can cut 5 planks. Therefore, the total number of planks he can get from all the logs is:

\[ 16 \times 5 = 80 \text{ planks} \]

If he sells each plank for $1.2, the total amount he makes is:

\[ 80 \times 1.2 = 96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{96} \]"

\[ 2 \times 5000 = 10000 \]

Their combined salary is:

\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is:

\[ 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

The total amount of money they all have together is:

\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"Given that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach and the beach portion of her walk is 2 miles, we can determine her speed on the beach. 

First, we calculate her speed on the beach:
\[ \text{Speed on beach} = \frac{\text{Distance on beach}}{\text{Time on beach}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Speed on sidewalk} = 2 \times \text{Speed on beach} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we calculate the time spent walking on the sidewalk, which is 1 mile:
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance on sidewalk}}{\text{Speed on sidewalk}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk gives us the total time for the 3-mile walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time on beach} + \text{Time on sidewalk} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it takes Grandma 50 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk."
"Jane has been saving $4 every week for 8 weeks. To find out how much she has saved so far, we multiply the amount she saves per week by the number of weeks:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save to reach her goal, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jane saves $4 each week, we can find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28 by dividing the remaining amount by the weekly savings:

\[ 28 \text{ dollars} \div 4 \text{ dollars/week} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."
"To find the total number of blue birds in the trees, we need to add up the number of birds in each group of trees.

First, we calculate the number of blue birds in the 3 trees that each had 7 blue birds:
3 trees * 7 blue birds/tree = 21 blue birds

Next, we calculate the number of blue birds in the 2 trees that each had 4 blue birds:
2 trees * 4 blue birds/tree = 8 blue birds

Finally, we add the number of blue birds in the 1 tree that had 3 blue birds:
1 tree * 3 blue birds/tree = 3 blue birds

Now, we add all these numbers together to get the total number of blue birds:
21 + 8 + 3 = 32

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob originally has. We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the original number of marbles Bob has:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtract 24 from both sides to solve for the original number of marbles:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} = 60 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Original number of marbles} = 36 \]

Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, we subtract 10 from the original number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water that would allow Donny to drink the mixture after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle.

Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of \( T \)-degree water into his water bottle, the resulting mixture must be at least 40 degrees for him to drink it.

The total volume of the mixture is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces.

The average temperature of the mixture can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Average temperature} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \]

We need this average temperature to be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40 \]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):
\[ 4 \times 33 = 132 \]

Now, substitute this into the inequality:
\[ \frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40 \]

To clear the fraction, multiply both sides by 5:
\[ 132 + T \geq 200 \]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T \):
\[ T \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the mixture.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over the three-week period and then add these to the initial numbers.

1. **Initial number of cows**: 50
2. **Initial number of chickens**: 20
3. **Cows added per day**: 20
4. **Chickens added per day**: 10
5. **Number of days in three weeks**: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Now, calculate the total number of cows and chickens added over 21 days:

- **Total cows added**: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
- **Total chickens added**: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Now, add the initial numbers to the totals added:

- **Total cows**: 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows
- **Total chickens**: 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

Finally, add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals:

- **Total animals**: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

**Final numerical answer:**
700"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total:
\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost per single bagel by dividing the total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{36 \text{ bagels}} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel} \]

So, the cost of each single bagel is:
\[ 1 \text{ dollar} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means Gomer ate \(23 - 5 = 18\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

2. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means it takes \(6 - 3 = 3\) potatoes to make \(3 - 1 = 2\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops.
   - Since 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, we can set up a proportion to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops.
   - The ratio of potatoes to scoops is \(3:2\). To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}}
     \]
   - Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x = \frac{3 \times 18}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes."
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs he consumes over the 60 days.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs for the first 30 days is:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs for the next 30 days is:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of eggs consumed over the 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of red jellybeans.
2. Calculate the total number of green and red jellybeans.
3. Subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans to find the number of blue jellybeans.

Step 1: Jess can see that there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans. Therefore, the number of red jellybeans is:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Step 2: The total number of green and red jellybeans is:
\[ 17 + 34 = 51 \]

Step 3: The total number of jellybeans in the jar is 60. Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is:
\[ 60 - 51 = 9 \]

So, the number of blue jellybeans is \(\boxed{9}\)."

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can represent the number of men as 5x and the number of women as 9x, where x is a common multiplier.

The total number of passengers is the sum of men and women, which is given as 84. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[5x + 9x = 84\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[14x = 84\]

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 14:

\[x = \frac{84}{14} = 6\]

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of women on the bus initially:

\[9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\]

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

\[54 - 20 = 34\]

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day.
2. Calculate the number of sunflowers sold in 3 days.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day.**

- Faraday earns $26 from selling sunflowers per day.
- Each sunflower costs $2.
- Therefore, the number of sunflowers sold per day is $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of sunflowers sold in 3 days.**

So, Faraday was able to sell 39 sunflowers after 3 days."
"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Since each rock costs $5, we divide $100 by $5:

\[ \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Adam can buy 20 rocks.

Next, we need to find out how many rocks he sells. He sells 60% of his inventory, so we calculate 60% of 20:

\[ 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \]

Adam sells 12 rocks.

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling these 12 rocks. Each rock is sold for $7, so:

\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \]

Adam earns $84 from selling the rocks.

To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to subtract the revenue from the initial investment. Adam's initial investment is $100, and his revenue is $84, so the loss is:

\[ 100 - 84 = 16 \]

Therefore, Adam loses $16."
"To determine how many days it will take Lauren to create all the picture scenes, we need to calculate the total number of days required for each size of picture scene and then sum these values.

1. **Large-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for large-sized scenes is \( \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) days.

2. **Medium-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for medium-sized scenes is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) days.

3. **Small-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for small-sized scenes is \( \frac{49}{7} = 7 \) days.

Now, we sum the days required for each size of picture scene:
\[ 9 \text{ days} + 6 \text{ days} + 7 \text{ days} = 22 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Lauren \(\boxed{22}\) days to create all of the picture scenes."

Therefore, Patricia now has 21 roses."
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then divide the total distance by the total time.

First, let's calculate the total distance:
- Distance for the first part of the trip: 110 miles
- Distance for the second part of the trip: 140 miles
- Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Next, let's calculate the total time:
- Time for the first part of the trip: 2 hours
- Time for the second part of the trip: 3 hours
- Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, we can find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{250 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to first determine the probability of winning for the second ticket. 

Given that the first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, we can express this as a probability of 0.20. The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket, so its probability of winning is \(3 \times 0.20 = 0.60\) or 60%.

The probability that both tickets are winners is the product of the individual probabilities of each ticket winning. Therefore, we multiply the probability of the first ticket winning (0.20) by the probability of the second ticket winning (0.60):

\[0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12\]

Expressing 0.12 as a percentage, we get:

\[0.12 \times 100 = 12\%\]

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"First, let's determine how many seashells Carlos collected. Since Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected, we can find the number of seashells Carlos collected by subtracting 5 from 27:

\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]

So, Carlos collected 22 seashells.

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. Therefore, we can find the number of seashells Carrey collected by dividing the number of seashells Carlos collected by 2:

\[ 22 \div 2 = 11 \]

So, Carrey collected 11 seashells.

Now, we can find the total number of seashells collected by adding the seashells collected by Jim, Carlos, and Carrey:

\[ 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \]

They gathered all their seashells and divided them equally between themselves. Since there are 3 people, we divide the total number of seashells by 3:

\[ 60 \div 3 = 20 \]

Each person gets 20 seashells.

\[
\text{Each person gets 20 seashells.}

"Mason eats 4 carrots each weekday, and there are 5 weekdays in a week. So, the total number of carrots he eats from Monday to Friday is:

4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is:

5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots

Adding the carrots he eats during the weekdays and the weekend gives us the total number of carrots he eats in a week:

20 carrots (weekdays) + 10 carrots (weekend) = 30 carrots

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots a week."
"The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes = 0.60 * 5 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes long.

Now, to find the total length of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs:

5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes

The total cassette time is 13 minutes."
"Linus buys each mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the original price, which means he sells each device for $40.

First, let's calculate the profit from selling one device:
\[ \text{Profit per device} = \text{Selling price} - \text{Buying price} = 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Next, we calculate the total profit from selling all the devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday:
- He bought 2 devices on Monday, so the profit from Monday's devices is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]
- He bought 4 devices on Tuesday, so the profit from Tuesday's devices is:
\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Adding the profits from both days:
\[ 40 + 80 = 120 \]

Therefore, the total profit Linus earned after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday is:

   \]
4. Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so the length of Carl's cane is:
   \[
   \frac{6 \text{ feet}}{2} = 3 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is 3 feet."
"To satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required based on the information given.

1. Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
2. Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required would be:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles they need to produce, we subtract the current production from the total required:
\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce an additional 7300 bottles of juice to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of octuplets**: 8

2. **Dressing the octuplets**:
   - 3/4 of the octuplets are dressed in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
   - 1/4 of the octuplets are dressed in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

3. **Wearing bows**:
   - All 2 blue-wearers also wear bows.

"To find out how many tax reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and Thursday and Friday from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week: 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday: 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday: 2136

Now, let's calculate the reports received on Wednesday:

5168 (total reports) - 1907 (Monday and Tuesday) - 2136 (Thursday and Friday) = 1125

So, the IRS received 1125 tax reports on Wednesday."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Abraham initially owns 80 square meters of land.
2. He sold half of the land for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.
3. After selling 40 square meters, he has 40 square meters left.
4. He then sold another 1/4 of his remaining land for $30. One-fourth of 40 square meters is 10 square meters. So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.
5. After these two sales, he has 30 square meters left (40 - 10 = 30).
6. He then sold the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter. So, he earned 30 * $3 = $90 from the last sale.

Now, let's add up all the money he earned:
- From the first sale: $50
- From the second sale: $30
- From the third sale: $90

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $90 = $170

Therefore, Abraham will be able to earn $170 after selling all his unused land."
"To find Geb's age, we start by calculating half of Haley's age and then subtract 10 from that value.

Haley's age = 26 years

Half of Haley's age = 26 / 2 = 13 years

Geb's age = Half of Haley's age - 10 = 13 - 10 = 3 years

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old."
"Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. If he goes out three times a day, he uses:

2 masks/go out * 3 times/day = 6 masks/day

Over 2 days, he would use:

6 masks/day * 2 days = 12 masks

Therefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen equals 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei: \(5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\) eggs.

To find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs hidden: \(36 - 27 = 9\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
9 eggs are still hidden in the yard."
"First, let's calculate the number of apartments in the third complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have:

\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. So, we calculate 60% of 400:

\[ 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \]

Adding this to the 400 apartments gives us the total number of apartments in the third complex:

\[ 400 + 240 = 640 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of apartments in all three complexes:

\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:

\[ 1040 \times 3 = 3120 \]

He gets paid $0.40 per collection. So, the total amount of money he makes in a week is:

\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1248} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **5-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. Let's denote the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces as \(x\). So, the 8-year-old tree produces \(x - 200\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old avocado tree**: Doesn't produce any fruit.
6. **10-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we need to find the value of \(x\) (the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces). According to the problem, the 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than the 10-year-old tree, so:
\[ x - 200 = 150 \]
\[ x = 150 + 200 \]
\[ x = 350 \]

So, a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits, and an 8-year-old tree produces 350 fruits.

Now, let's sum up the total number of fruits produced over the 10 years:
\[ 50 + 150 + 350 + 0 + 1000 = 1650 \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:
\[ \boxed{1650} \]"
"Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100, which is $20. 

Jack originally had $100. After receiving $20 from Sophia, Jack now has:

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters, and the length of the red rope as \( R \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we can express \( Y \) in terms of \( B \) using the second relationship:
\[ Y = B + 7 \]

Now, we substitute \( R \) and \( Y \) in terms of \( B \) into the third relationship:
\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ B = 5 \]

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( R \) and \( Y \):
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]
\[ Y = B + 7 = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

So, the length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters.

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters."
"First, let's determine how much money Rissa was given. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( 4/5 \) of her original money. Therefore, we can write the equation for Rissa's remaining money as:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, Rissa gave $3 to their little sister. Since Ronnie and Rissa gave the same amount of money to their little sister, Ronnie also gave $3. Therefore, the amount of money left with Ronnie is:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Given that the mural uses 12 pints of paint in total and that half of the mural is yellow, we can determine the amount of yellow paint used:

\[ \text{Amount of yellow paint} = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Since the mural has equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, and the total amount of paint used for these three colors is the remaining half of the mural:

\[ \text{Total amount of red, white, and purple paint} = 12 - 6 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we divide the total amount of these three colors by 3:

\[ \text{Amount of red paint} = \frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, the number of pints of red paint used is:

2 pints"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is:

\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total area of the house is:

\[ 3160 \text{ square feet} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cloud puffs Alice counts each day and then sum them up for the five days.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
2. **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Monday, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum up the puffs from all five days:
\[3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93\]

So, at the end of the week, Alice will have counted a total of 93 cloud puffs."
"First, let's determine the number of pods in the special size box. The regular box contains 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods. 

To find 20% of 100:
\[ 100 \times 0.20 = 20 \]

So, the special size box contains:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. To find the cost per pod in the special size box:
\[ \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, the cost per cycle is $0.10. To find out how many cycles you can run for $1:
\[ \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \]

So, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1 with the new box.

"Thomas initially withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. To find out how many 20 dollar bills he gets, we divide $1000 by $20:

\[ \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \]

So, he has 50 twenty-dollar bills.

He loses 10 of these bills while getting home, so he has:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

He then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, he uses 20 twenty-dollar bills to pay for a bill, leaving him with:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Thomas then triples his money. Since he has 20 twenty-dollar bills, the total amount of money he has is:

\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \]

Tripling this amount gives:

\[ 400 \times 3 = 1200 \]

Finally, he converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we divide $1200 by $5:

\[ \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"In the first half:
- Team A scores 4 goals.
- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, which is 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half:
- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals.
- Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, which is 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

Total number of goals scored in the match:
- Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
- Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

Total goals = 6 (Team A) + 10 (Team B) = 16 goals

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the length of the chalk after Monday.
2. Calculate how much chalk is used each day.
3. Determine how many days the chalk will last before it needs to be recycled.

**Step 1: Determine the length of the chalk after Monday.**

The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk and used 45% of it on Monday. So, the remaining chalk is:
\[ 5 \times (1 - 0.45) = 5 \times 0.55 = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]

**Step 2: Calculate how much chalk is used each day.**

The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. So, the amount of chalk used each day is:
\[ 0.20 \times \text{current length of chalk} \]

**Step 3: Determine how many days the chalk will last before it needs to be recycled.**

We need to find out how many days it will take for the chalk to be reduced to 2 inches or less. We can do this by iteratively subtracting the daily usage from the current length of the chalk until it is 2 inches or less.

- **Day 1:**
  \[ 2.75 - 0.20 \times 2.75 = 2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20 \text{ inches} \]

- **Day 2:**
  \[ 2.20 - 0.20 \times 2.20 = 2.20 - 0.44 = 1.76 \text{ inches} \]

Since 1.76 inches is less than 2 inches, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk on the second day.

Therefore, the teacher has \(\boxed{2}\) days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of teeth drilled:**
   - The dentist drills 4 teeth.

2. **Determine the number of teeth capped:**
   - The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills.
   - Therefore, the number of teeth capped = 4 (drilled) + 7 = 11 teeth.

3. **Calculate the total number of teeth fixed:**
   - Teeth fixed = Teeth drilled + Teeth capped = 4 + 11 = 15 teeth.

4. **Calculate the percentage of teeth fixed:**
   - Total teeth = 30
   - Percentage of teeth fixed = (Number of teeth fixed / Total number of teeth) * 100
   - Percentage of teeth fixed = (15 / 30) * 100 = 0.5 * 100 = 50%

The final numerical answer is 50%."
"First, we need to calculate the total amount of milk that passed the expiry date. Mr. Marcellus purchased 4000 gallons of milk, and 2/5 of this amount was spoiled.

\[ \text{Spoiled milk} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we calculate the refund amount based on the cost per gallon, which is $3.5.

\[ \text{Refund} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$5600 \]

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of \(\boxed{5600}\) dollars."
"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 5(C + 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7) \]

Next, we'll eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, we'll isolate \( C \) by moving all terms involving \( C \) to one side and constants to the other:
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books he can buy per school.

First, we know that Bob can buy 100 books for $500. To find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy with $27000, we divide $27000 by $500:

\[ \frac{27000}{500} = 54 \]

This means Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books. Since each set is 100 books, the total number of books he can buy is:

\[ 54 \times 100 = 5400 \]

Now, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books he can buy per school. Since there are 3 schools, we divide 5400 by 3:

\[ \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \]

So, Bob can buy 1800 books per school.

"Let's break down the sequence of events to determine how many apples Newton brought home.

1. Initially, two apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up the two apples and put one in his pocket, throwing the other one back into the tree, which caused 5 more apples to fall out.
3. Newton picked up these 5 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one back at the tree, which caused 6 more apples to fall out.
4. Newton picked up all of the remaining apples and went home to make a pie.

Now, let's count the apples:

- Initially, 2 apples fell.
- Newton put 1 in his pocket and threw 1 back, so 5 more fell, making it 2 + 5 = 7 apples.
- Newton put 4 in his pocket and threw 1 back, so 6 more fell, making it 7 + 6 = 13 apples.
- Newton picked up all 13 apples and went home.

Therefore, the total number of apples Newton brought home is 13.

"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices and pepperoni pizza slices that Kate's friends will eat.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices.

So, the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten by her friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ cheese slices} \]

And the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten by her friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ pepperoni slices} \]

Now, we need to determine how many cheese and pepperoni pizza pies are required to provide these slices.

Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, the number of cheese pizza pies needed is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ cheese slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ cheese pizza pies} \]

And since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizza pies needed is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ pepperoni slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pepperoni pizza pies} \]

Therefore, the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net increase in the number of snowballs Jay has over time, considering both the rate at which he makes snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of making snowballs:** Jay can make 20 snowballs in an hour. This means he makes 20/60 = 1/3 snowballs per minute.

2. **Rate of melting:** 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. This means 2/15 snowballs melt per minute.

3. **Net rate of increase in snowballs:** The net increase in the number of snowballs per minute is the rate of making minus the rate of melting, which is (1/3 - 2/15) snowballs per minute.

To find the net rate, we need a common denominator for the fractions:
- 1/3 = 5/15
- 2/15 = 2/15

So, the net rate of increase is (5/15 - 2/15) = 3/15 = 1/5 snowballs per minute.

4. **Time to reach 60 snowballs:** We need to find out how many minutes it takes to get 60 snowballs at a rate of 1/5 snowballs per minute. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of snowballs needed by the net rate of increase:
- Time = 60 / (1/5) = 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Jim's age at the time Digimon came out and then find out how old he is now.

1. First, we know that John is currently 28 years old.
2. Let's denote the number of years since Digimon came out as \( x \).
3. According to the problem, when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. If we let Jim's age at that time be \( y \), then John's age at that time was \( 2y \).
4. Since John is now 28, we can express his age at the time Digimon came out as \( 28 - x \).
5. Similarly, Jim's current age is \( y + x \).

From the information given, we have:
\[ 28 - x = 2y \]

We need to find the value of \( y \) (Jim's age when Digimon came out) and then determine Jim's current age.

Since we don't have the exact number of years since Digimon came out, we can use the relationship between John's and Jim's ages at the time of Digimon's release to find Jim's current age.

Let's assume \( x \) years have passed since Digimon came out. Then:
\[ 28 - x = 2y \]
\[ y = \frac{28 - x}{2} \]

Jim's current age is:
\[ y + x = \frac{28 - x}{2} + x \]
\[ y + x = \frac{28 - x + 2x}{2} \]
\[ y + x = \frac{28 + x}{2} \]

Since we don't have the exact value of \( x \), we can't determine the exact numerical value of \( y \) without it. However, we can express Jim's current age in terms of \( x \).

To find a specific numerical answer, we need to know the exact number of years since Digimon came out. Without that information, we can't provide a final numerical answer. If we assume \( x = 4 \) (for example), then:

\[ y = \frac{28 - 4}{2} = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \]
\[ \text{Jim's current age} = 12 + 4 = 16 \]

So, if \( x = 4 \), Jim is 16 years old now. However, without the exact value of \( x \), we can't provide a definitive numerical answer. If you have the exact number of years since Digimon came out, please provide it, and I can calculate the exact age for you."
"Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find the total number of slices they all ate, we add the slices each one ate:
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

They all ate a total of 6 slices of apple."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, at the end of the first day, they had:
   \[50 - 38 = 12\] bandages left.

2. On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used:
   \[38 - 10 = 28\] bandages. Therefore, at the end of the second day, they had:
   \[12 - 28 = -16\] bandages, but since they can't have a negative number of bandages, this means they needed to order more bandages to cover the deficit. They ordered one more bulk pack of 50 bandages, so at the end of the second day, they had:
   \[50 - 28 = 22\] bandages left.

3. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they received:
   \[2 \times 50 = 100\] bandages. They used half a pack, which is:
   \[50 / 2 = 25\] bandages. Therefore, at the end of the third day, they had:
   \[22 + 100 - 25 = 97\] bandages.

However, the problem states that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means we need to adjust our initial count. If they had 78 bandages at the end of the third day, and they received 100 bandages and used 25, then before these transactions, they must have had:
\[78 - 100 + 25 = 3\] bandages at the start of the third day.

Since they had 22 bandages at the end of the second day, and they needed to have 3 bandages at the start of the third day, they must have ordered additional bandages on the second day to make up the difference. But since they ordered a full pack of 50 bandages, they must have had:
\[3 + 50 - 22 = 31\] bandages at the start of the second day.

Finally, since they had 12 bandages at the end of the first day, and they needed to have 31 bandages at the start of the second day, they must have started with:
\[31 + 38 - 12 = 57\] bandages on the first day.

So, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is:
\[57\]"
"To determine the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to calculate the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut separately, and then add them together.

1. The cost of the color is given as $40.
2. The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch. Her hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, so the length of the haircut is 10 - 8 = 2 inches. Therefore, the cost of the haircut is 2 inches * $30/inch = $60.

Adding the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut together, we get:
$40 (color) + $60 (haircut) = $100.

The final numerical answer is:
$100."
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days Jen works in April.
2. Calculate her earnings from her hourly rate.
3. Add the additional $10 for complete attendance.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of days Jen works in April.**
Since April has exactly 4 weeks and Jen works 6 days a week, the total number of days she works in April is:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ days} \]

**Step 2: Calculate her earnings from her hourly rate.**
Jen's hourly rate is $1.5, and she works 7.5 hours a day. So, her daily earnings are:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$11.25/\text{day} \]
For 24 days, her total earnings from her hourly rate are:
\[ 24 \text{ days} \times \$11.25/\text{day} = \$270 \]

**Step 3: Add the additional $10 for complete attendance.**
Since Jen did not incur any absences, she receives the additional $10 for complete attendance. So, her total earnings for April are:
\[ \$270 + \$10 = \$280 \]

**Final Answer:**
\[ \$280 \]"
"To calculate how much money Jason earned, we need to multiply the number of times he performed each task by the amount he earns for that task and then sum up all the amounts.

1. For emptying the dishwasher: $0.50 per time, and he did it 6 times.
   \[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]

2. For doing his laundry: $3.00 per time, and he did it once.
   \[ 1 \times 3.00 = 3.00 \]

3. For cleaning his room: $1.50 per time, and he did it once.
   \[ 1 \times 1.50 = 1.50 \]

4. For taking the trash to the curb: $0.75 per time, and he did it twice.
   \[ 2 \times 0.75 = 1.50 \]

Now, we add all these amounts together:
\[ 3.00 + 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 = 9.00 \]

So, the total amount of money Jason earned in a two-week period is $9.00."
"Each whale has 40 gallons of blood. A shark has three times as much blood as a whale, so a shark has:

\[ 40 \text{ gallons} \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

If we have ten sharks, the total amount of blood for ten sharks would be:

\[ 120 \text{ gallons/shark} \times 10 \text{ sharks} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

1200 gallons"
"To calculate the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up the number of people who entered at different times.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we add all these numbers together:

\[50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320\]

Therefore, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack contains 5 pens, the total number of red pens is:

\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

She also bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. Therefore, the number of black pens is:

\[ 2 \times 25 \text{ red pens} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

To find the total number of pens, we add the number of red pens and black pens together:

\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

Alain has \(\boxed{75}\) pens."
"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles for $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 20 bottles of cognac:

\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount spent:

\[ 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount John spends on everything is:

\[ \boxed{2400} \]"
"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted:
- 20 White Oak trees
- Twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees

On the second day, he planted:
- 10 more White Oak trees than the first day, which is \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees
- \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days:
- Total White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\)
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: \(40 + 50 = 90\)

Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:
\[50 + 90 = 140\]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Fred initially made 24 gallons of root beer.
2. His children drank 4 gallons, leaving 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.
3. His wife spilled 7 gallons, leaving 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.
4. His friend Ronnie took 5 gallons, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people (including Fred) showed up for the party. The remaining root beer is 8 gallons, which will be shared equally among the 3 people.

To find out how much each person gets, we divide the remaining root beer by the number of people:

8 gallons / 3 people = 8/3 gallons per person

So, each person gets 8/3 gallons of root beer, which is approximately 2.67 gallons.

Final numerical answer:
8/3 gallons or approximately 2.67 gallons per person."
"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \( 8 \).

Final numerical answer:
8"
"To find the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes, we can break down the problem into steps.

1. Calculate the number of fish with red stripes:
   - One-third of the fish have red stripes.
   - Number of fish with red stripes = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \).

2. Calculate the number of remaining fish after removing the fish with red stripes:
   - Remaining fish = Total fish - Fish with red stripes = 66 - 22 = 44.

3. Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish:
   - Five-elevenths of the remaining fish have blue stripes.
   - Number of fish with blue stripes = \( \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \).

4. Calculate the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes:
   - Total fish with red and blue stripes = Fish with red stripes + Fish with blue stripes = 22 + 20 = 42.

Therefore, the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 42."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Amy originally had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so that's \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
2. She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so that's \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.
3. In total, before any theft or usage, Amy had \(8 + 18 = 26\) eyeshadow colors.

Now, let's account for the changes:

4. Her sister steals one of the palettes, which had 4 colors. So, \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors left.
5. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each set has 6 colors, half of that is \(6 / 2 = 3\) colors. So, she uses 3 colors from one set, leaving \(18 - 3 = 15\) colors from that set.
6. Adding the remaining colors from the other two sets, we have \(15 + 4 = 19\) colors from the makeup sets.
7. Adding the remaining palette, we have \(19 + 4 = 22\) colors in total.

So, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
22"
"Mattison is 60 inches tall.

The height of the two-story house is 7 times Mattison's height:
\[ 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The floor to ceiling height on the first floor is thrice Mattison's height:
\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we subtract the first floor's ceiling height from the total height of the house:
\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:
\[ 240 \text{ inches} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many shells team Alphas found. Since they found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

This means team Alphas found 280 shells. Now, we need to find out how many shells were left for the other two teams:

\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

So, team The finders found 252 shells. To find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the number of shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells:

\[ 420 - 252 = 168 \]

Therefore, team Gogetters found 168 shells."
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

First, let's calculate the total miles walked by all four dogs based on the average:
- The average miles walked per day by the four dogs is 3 miles.
- Therefore, the total miles walked by all four dogs in a day is \(3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles}\).

Next, we know the miles walked by the first three dogs:
- The first dog walks 1 mile.
- The second dog walks 4 miles.
- The third dog walks 3 miles.

Adding these up gives us the total miles walked by the first three dogs:
\[1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}\]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs:
\[12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles}\]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day."
"First, we calculate the amount of the loan John gets by taking 40% of the value of his house:

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, we determine how much of the loan he uses to pay off his debts by taking 60% of the loan amount:

\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Finally, we subtract the amount used to pay debts from the total loan amount to find out how much money he has leftover:

\[ \text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the amount of money John had leftover after paying his debts is:

\[ \boxed{40000} \]"
"To find out how much Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught. 

The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms, the second tuna weighs 46 kilograms, and the last tuna weighs 26 kilograms. 

Total weight of the tunas = 56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg

Now, if a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the total weight by the price per kilogram.

Total earnings = 128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To find Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines. She sells them at 11/8 of the price she bought them for. Given that she bought the magazines at $72, we can calculate the selling price as follows:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11 \times 72}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{792}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the buying price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To find the total amount of water removed from the air, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed = 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.

2. **Medium setting:**
   - Removes twice as much as the low setting, so it removes 2 liters per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed = 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.

3. **High setting:**
   - Removes twice as much as the medium setting, so it removes 4 liters per day.
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed = 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Now, we sum the amounts of water removed at each setting:
- Total water removed = 3 liters (low) + 6 liters (medium) + 20 liters (high) = 29 liters.

Therefore, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."
"To find out how many balloons Jolene and her friends threw, we first need to calculate the total number of balloons they started with and then subtract the number of balloons left at the end of the afternoon.

1. Calculate the total number of balloons:
   - They filled up 10 packs of balloons, with 30 balloons per pack.
   - Total balloons = 10 packs * 30 balloons/pack = 300 balloons.

2. Subtract the number of balloons left at the end of the afternoon:
   - Balloons left = 12.
   - Balloons thrown = Total balloons - Balloons left = 300 - 12 = 288.

So, they threw 288 balloons."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how much of the second medicine Saanvi used for one dose. Since the second medicine is 3 times the amount of the first medicine, and the first medicine is 14 mL, the second medicine would be \(3 \times 14 = 42\) mL.

2. Now, we add the amounts of both medicines for one dose: \(14 \, \text{mL} + 42 \, \text{mL} = 56 \, \text{mL}\).

3. To find out how much medicine is in 8 doses, we multiply the amount for one dose by 8: \(56 \, \text{mL} \times 8 = 448 \, \text{mL}\).

Therefore, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is 448 mL."
"First, we need to determine the capacity of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, we can calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[ \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:

\[ \text{Total capacity of John's school} = 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, we know the capacity of Ali's class is 120 students. Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is:

\[ \text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students} \]

The combined capacity of both schools is 150 students."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen will owe his sister including the 2% interest.

The principal amount Stephen borrowed is $300. The interest is 2% of $300, which is calculated as follows:
\[ 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen will owe is:
\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in 11 months is:
\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he has already paid from the total amount he owes:
\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day.
2. There are 2 children, so the total number of diaper changes per day for both children is \(5 \times 2 = 10\).
3. Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers. Therefore, she changes \(10 \div 2 = 5\) diapers per day.
4. Since the total number of diaper changes is 10 and his wife changes 5, Jordan changes the remaining 5 diapers per day.

Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day."
"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the jar.
2. Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans, considering the packing efficiency.
3. Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.
4. Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans.
5. Compare the estimated number of red jelly beans to the true number of red jelly beans.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.**

The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall. The volume \( V \) of the jar is:
\[ V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans.**

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume \( V_{\text{eff}} \) is:
\[ V_{\text{eff}} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 3: Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.**

Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches. The total number of jelly beans \( N \) that can fit in the jar is:
\[ N = \frac{V_{\text{eff}}}{\text{volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans.**

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red. The estimated number of red jelly beans \( N_{\text{red}} \) is:
\[ N_{\text{red}} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

**Step 5: Compare the estimated number of red jelly beans to the true number of red jelly beans.**

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between the true number and Tim's estimate is:
\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

Therefore, Tim's guess was off by 36 jelly beans."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the bus had 20 people on board.
2. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus now is:
   \[
   20 + 40 = 60
   \]
3. At the second stop, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who entered at the first stop entered again. So, the number of people who entered at the second stop is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30
   \]
4. Adding these 30 people to the 60 people already on the bus, the total number of people on the bus now is:
   \[
   60 + 30 = 90
   \]
5. At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the number of people on the bus now is:
   \[
   90 \times 2 = 180
   \]
6. The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find out how many more people are needed to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the current number of people on the bus from the bus's capacity:
   \[
   200 - 180 = 20
   \]

Therefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"First, let's calculate the cost of one visit after the increase. The original cost of one visit is $2. An increase of 150% means the cost is increased by 150% of $2.

150% of $2 = 1.5 * $2 = $3

So, the new cost of one visit is $2 (original cost) + $3 (increase) = $5.

Pauline visits the museum three times a year. For 5 years, the cost per visit is $2, so the total cost for one year is:
3 visits/year * $2/visit = $6/year

For 5 years, the total cost is:
5 years * $6/year = $30

After 5 years, the cost per visit increased to $5. For the next 3 years, the cost per visit is $5, so the total cost for one year is:
3 visits/year * $5/visit = $15/year

For 3 years, the total cost is:
3 years * $15/year = $45

Adding the cost for the first 5 years and the next 3 years, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is:
$30 + $45 = $75

Therefore, Pauline spent a total of $75 on all visits to the museum."
"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students who can try the escape room.
2. Determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed.
3. Calculate the total time required for all groups to try the escape room.

First, we know that there are 10 students in each of the 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th) who can try the escape room. Therefore, the total number of students is:
\[ 10 \text{ students/grade} \times 4 \text{ grades} = 40 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed from these 40 students:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students/group}} = 5 \text{ groups} \]

Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room. Since all groups use their full 45 minutes and there are 5 groups, the total time required for all groups to try the escape room is:
\[ 5 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 225 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take \(\boxed{225}\) minutes for everyone to try the escape room."
"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the wooden tables and the roof frames separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the wooden tables:
- John made 4 wooden tables.
- Each table costs $20.
- So, the total cost for the tables is \(4 \times 20 = 80\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the roof frames:
- John made 2 roof frames.
- Each roof frame costs $10.
- So, the total cost for the roof frames is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the tables and the roof frames to find the total amount Ali has to pay:
- Total cost = Cost of tables + Cost of roof frames
- Total cost = \(80 + 20 = 100\) dollars.

Therefore, Ali has to pay John a total of $100."
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we calculate:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine how much of the secret steakhouse seasoning Aiden will need, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of ground beef needed:**
   - Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef.
   - He wants to make 80 meatballs.
   - Therefore, the amount of ground beef needed is \( \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds of ground beef} \).

2. **Calculate the amount of secret seasoning needed:**
   - Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for every pound of ground beef.
   - Since he needs 5 pounds of ground beef, the amount of secret seasoning needed is \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \).

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning to make 80 meatballs."
"First, we need to calculate the total width of the windows. Since there are five windows and each window is 35 inches wide, the total width is:

\[ 5 \times 35 = 175 \text{ inches} \]

Next, Luke needs fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. So, we multiply the total width by 2:

\[ 175 \times 2 = 350 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining minutes.

1. For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute.
   - Cost for the first 16 minutes = 16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

2. For the remaining minutes (36 - 16 = 20 minutes), the cost is $0.20 per minute.
   - Cost for the remaining 20 minutes = 20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00

3. Total cost for the 36-minute call = Cost for the first 16 minutes + Cost for the remaining 20 minutes
   - Total cost = $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

The total cost for a 36-minute call is $8.00."

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly makes as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be written as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

The total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is the sum of the number of cupcakes and the number of brownies. Since each of the 5 people in the class gets 2 treats, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

So, we have:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]
\[ C = 3 \]

Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the basic manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount.

The basic manicure costs $35 and the pedicure costs $40. The total cost before the discount is:
\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

With a 20% discount, the amount of the discount is:
\[ 75 \times 0.20 = 15 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Next, we need to add the cost of the nail art. Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, which means 10 nails (since there are 10 fingers on both hands). The cost of nail art per nail is $3, so the total cost for nail art is:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Adding the cost of the nail art to the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure, we get:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

Therefore, the total amount Karen would pay is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"To find out how many magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the total number of issues from each magazine and then sum them up.

1. For the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year each:
   \[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ issues} \]

2. For the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
   \[ 6 \text{ issues} \]

3. For the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
   \[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ issues} \]

Now, we sum up all the issues:
\[ 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 \text{ issues} \]

So, Susan gets a total of 66 issues every year. However, the question asks for the number of magazines, not the number of issues. We need to count the number of magazines:

- 3 magazines with 12 issues each
- 1 magazine with 6 issues
- 1 magazine with 24 issues

Therefore, the total number of magazines Susan gets every year is:
\[ 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 \]

Final numerical answer:
5"
"Given that Samantha has 27 paintings and she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, we can determine the number of paintings Shelley has by adding 12 to Samantha's number of paintings.

Shelley's paintings = Samantha's paintings + 12
Shelley's paintings = 27 + 12
Shelley's paintings = 39

Now, since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, we can find the number of paintings Kim has by subtracting 8 from Shelley's number of paintings.

Kim's paintings = Shelley's paintings - 8
Kim's paintings = 39 - 8
Kim's paintings = 31

Kim has 31 paintings."
"To find the final price of the toy after the changes in price, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price of the toy after the 80% increase in December.
2. Calculate the price of the toy after the 50% decrease in January.

**Step 1: Calculate the price after the 80% increase in December.**

The original price in November is $40. An 80% increase means the price is increased by 80% of $40.

\[ \text{Increase} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]

So, the new price in December is:

\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price after the 50% decrease in January.**

The price in December is $72. A 50% decrease means the price is reduced by 50% of $72.

\[ \text{Decrease} = 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.50 = 36 \]

So, the final price in January is:

\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \]

Therefore, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"First, let's calculate the amount Charlie makes from the 4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour.

\[ 4 \text{ lessons} \times \$80 \text{ per lesson} = \$320 \]

Next, we need to determine the reduced rate for lessons with a veteran. Since the rate is reduced by 25%, we calculate 25% of $80 and subtract it from the standard rate.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$80 = 0.25 \times \$80 = \$20 \]

So, the reduced rate is:

\[ \$80 - \$20 = \$60 \]

Now, we calculate the amount Charlie makes from the 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran at the reduced rate of $60 per hour.

\[ 2 \text{ lessons} \times \$60 \text{ per lesson} = \$120 \]

Finally, we add the amounts from both types of lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make for the day.

\[ \$320 + \$120 = \$440 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is:

\[ \$440 \]"

"First, let's calculate how many apples Walter ate. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 apples:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, let's find out how many apples he had left after eating:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Next, Walter gave 25% of the remaining apples to his sister. To find out how many apples that is, we calculate 25% of 36:

\[ 0.25 \times 36 = 9 \]

So, Walter gave 9 apples to his sister. Now, let's find out how many apples he had left after giving some to his sister:

\[ 36 - 9 = 27 \]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple:

\[ 27 \times 3 = 81 \]

Therefore, Walter received $81."

"To find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days. Since Michael travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we need to know how many hours he travels in 3 days. Assuming he travels 24 hours a day (excluding stops), the total travel time in 3 days is:

\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the total distance Michael travels in 72 hours:

\[ 72 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ km/hr} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the 6000 km distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered. We do this by dividing the distance Michael has traveled by the total distance and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:

\[ \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

"To determine how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the weekly cost and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

1. **Cost of pasta per week:**
   - Bud uses 1 box of pasta per week.
   - The cost of pasta is $1.00 per box.
   - Therefore, the cost of pasta per week is $1.00.

2. **Cost of cheddar cheese per week:**
   - Bud spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese per week.

3. **Cost of gruyere cheese per week:**
   - Bud spends twice the amount on gruyere cheese as he does on cheddar cheese.
   - Therefore, the cost of gruyere cheese per week is \(2 \times 3 = $6.00\).

4. **Total weekly cost:**
   - Adding the costs of pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese gives us the total weekly cost.
   - Total weekly cost = $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar cheese) + $6.00 (gruyere cheese) = $10.00.

5. **Annual cost:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.

"To determine the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.
2. Determine the total available time in minutes for the custodian over 5 days.
3. Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.
4. Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.**

Time per classroom = 15 minutes
Number of classrooms = 80

Total time required = 15 minutes/classroom * 80 classrooms = 1200 minutes

**Step 2: Determine the total available time in minutes for the custodian over 5 days.**

Working hours per day = 8 hours
Minutes per hour = 60 minutes

Total available time per day = 8 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/day

Total available time over 5 days = 480 minutes/day * 5 days = 2400 minutes

**Step 3: Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.**

Total time required = 1200 minutes
Total available time over 5 days = 2400 minutes

Average time spent cleaning per day = 1200 minutes / 5 days = 240 minutes/day

**Step 4: Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.**

Average time spent cleaning per day = 240 minutes
Total available time per day = 480 minutes

Percentage of the day spent cleaning = (240 minutes / 480 minutes) * 100% = 50%

The custodian spends 50% of their day, on average, cleaning classrooms."
"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:

- The middle 2 shelves together can hold \(10 + 10 = 20\) books.
- Adding the bottom and top shelves, the total capacity of one bookcase is \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. So, we can write:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):

"John takes 5 minutes to get to the first side of the Rubik's cube. 

The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so:
- Second side: \(5 \times 2 = 10\) minutes
- Third side: \(5 \times 2 = 10\) minutes

The last 2 sides each take half as long as the first side, so:
- Fourth side: \(5 \div 2 = 2.5\) minutes
- Fifth side: \(5 \div 2 = 2.5\) minutes

The sixth side is implied to be the last side, so it also takes 2.5 minutes.

Now, we add up the time for all six sides:

2. Calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings with the new varnish.
3. Subtract the total drying time of the old varnish from the total drying time of the new varnish to find the difference.

Step 1: Total drying time for 6 paintings with the old varnish
- Drying time for one painting with the old varnish = 7 minutes
- Total drying time for 6 paintings = 7 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 42 minutes

Step 2: Total drying time for 6 paintings with the new varnish
- Drying time for one painting with the new varnish = 12 minutes
- Total drying time for 6 paintings = 12 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 72 minutes

Step 3: Difference in drying time
- Difference = Total drying time with new varnish - Total drying time with old varnish
- Difference = 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes

Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish."
"To find out how many cups of water Crista needs every day for her plants, we can break down the problem into parts based on the different watering needs of the plants.

1. **Plants needing half a cup of water:**
   - There are 4 plants.
   - Each plant needs 0.5 cups of water.
   - Total water for these plants = 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups.

2. **Plants needing 1 cup of water:**
   - There are 8 plants.
   - Each plant needs 1 cup of water.
   - Total water for these plants = 8 * 1 = 8 cups.

3. **Plants needing a quarter of a cup of water:**
   - Total plants = 20
   - Plants needing half a cup = 4
   - Plants needing 1 cup = 8
   - Therefore, plants needing a quarter of a cup = 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants.
   - Each plant needs 0.25 cups of water.
   - Total water for these plants = 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Now, we add up the total water needed for all the plants:
- Total water = 2 cups (half a cup plants) + 8 cups (1 cup plants) + 2 cups (quarter a cup plants) = 12 cups.

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"Phineas Frog is 200 yards away from his home. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, he will travel 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

On land, Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute. Therefore, the time it takes to hop 100 yards on land is:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

In the water, Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute. Therefore, the time it takes to swim 100 yards in water is:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards/minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the time spent on land and in water gives the total time to return home:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take Phineas 15 minutes to return home."
"Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks for his project. Popsicles come 8 to a box. To find out how many boxes he needs, we divide the total number of popsicle sticks by the number of popsicle sticks per box:

\[ \frac{56 \text{ popsicle sticks}}{8 \text{ popsicle sticks/box}} = 7 \text{ boxes} \]

Each box costs $2.00, so the total cost for 7 boxes is:

\[ 7 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$14.00 \]

Therefore, it will cost Bob $14.00 to build his project."
"The main phone plan costs $20, and it costs twice as much as each additional phone. Therefore, each additional phone costs $20 / 2 = $10.

Since there are five phones in total and one of them is the main phone, there are 4 additional phones. The cost for the additional phones is 4 * $10 = $40.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones, which is $20 + $40 = $60.

Therefore, the whole phone plan costs $60."
"Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since there are 12 doughnuts in a dozen, he makes 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts daily.

June typically has 30 days. Therefore, in June, he makes 120 doughnuts/day * 30 days = 3600 doughnuts.

If he sells each doughnut for $2, then the total money he makes in June is 3600 doughnuts * $2/doughnut = $7200.

**$7200**"
"Jade uploads 7 photos in one batch and she uploads 6 batches each day. So, the number of photos she uploads each day is:

\[ 7 \text{ photos/batch} \times 6 \text{ batches/day} = 42 \text{ photos/day} \]

She has a total of 210 photos to upload. To find out how many days she will need to upload all her photos, we divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads each day:

\[ \frac{210 \text{ photos}}{42 \text{ photos/day}} = 5 \text{ days} \]

So, Jade will need 5 days to upload all of her photos."
"To calculate the total amount Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks, we first need to determine the cost for one week and then multiply that by 5.

1. Cost for blouses in one week: \(5 \text{ blouses} \times \$5.00 = \$25.00\)
2. Cost for pants in one week: \(2 \text{ pairs of pants} \times \$8.00 = \$16.00\)
3. Cost for skirts in one week: \(1 \text{ skirt} \times \$6.00 = \$6.00\)

Now, we add these amounts to find the total cost for one week:
\[
\$25.00 + \$16.00 + \$6.00 = \$47.00
\]

Next, we multiply the weekly cost by 5 to find the total cost for 5 weeks:
\[
\$47.00 \times 5 = \$235.00
\]

Therefore, Alicia spends \(\$235.00\) on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed after training. His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster:

\[ 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of words John needs to speak. Each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages:

\[ 450 \, \text{words/page} \times 10 \, \text{pages} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we can calculate the time it would take for John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. The time is calculated by dividing the total number of words by his speaking speed:

\[ \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speed."
"On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day, so:
50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so:
2 * 70 = 140 people.

For the rest of the week (days 4, 5, 6, and 7), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Since there are 4 days, the total number of people he saw on these days is:
4 * 60 = 240 people.

Now, to find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we add the number of people from each day:
50 (first day) + 70 (second day) + 140 (third day) + 240 (remaining days) = 500 people.

Total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week:
500 people."
"Let's break down the popping process step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds:** 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds:** The popping rate triples, so \(20 \times 3 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Following 30 seconds:** The popping rate quadruples, so \(20 \times 4 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds:** The popping rate is halved from the previous 30 seconds, so \(80 \div 2 = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, let's add up the number of kernels that popped in the first four 30-second intervals:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\]

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop. So, a quarter of 40 kernels pop:
\[40 \div 4 = 10\]

Adding these to the total:
\[200 + 10 = 210\]

Therefore, Garrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to eat."
"To determine how many lemons Tim will need, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount of lemonade needed:**
   - Tim needs 4 gallons for the party.
   - Allen asked for an extra gallon that is twice as tart, which means it will have the same amount of lemon juice as a regular gallon but will be more concentrated.
   - Therefore, Tim needs 4 gallons + 1 gallon = 5 gallons of lemonade in total.

2. **Determine the amount of lemon juice needed:**
   - For 1 gallon of lemonade, Tim needs 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.
   - For 5 gallons, he will need 5 cups of lemon juice.

3. **Calculate the number of lemons needed:**
   - 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
   - To get 5 cups of juice, Tim will need 5 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 30 lemons.

Therefore, Tim will need 30 lemons."
"To find out how much dog food the Kennel house will need in a week, we first need to calculate the daily consumption for each breed and then extend that to a week.

1. **German Shepherds:**

   - Daily consumption per German Shepherd: 5 kg
   - Total daily consumption for German Shepherds: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) kg

2. **Bulldogs:**
   - Number of Bulldogs: 2
   - Daily consumption per Bulldog: 3 kg
   - Total daily consumption for Bulldogs: \(2 \times 3 = 6\) kg

3. **Total daily consumption:**
   - Total daily consumption for all dogs: \(15 + 6 = 21\) kg

4. **Weekly consumption:**
   - Since there are 7 days in a week, the total weekly consumption is: \(21 \times 7 = 147\) kg

Therefore, the Kennel house will need **147 kilograms** of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we first calculate the total number of legs from both the 2-legged and 4-legged animals.

For the 2-legged animals:
10 animals * 2 legs/animal = 20 legs

For the 4-legged animals:
15 animals * 4 legs/animal = 60 legs

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:
20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

Since we need to find the number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:
80 legs / 2 = 40 pairs of legs

Final numerical answer:
40 pairs of legs"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know there are 4 blue blocks.
2. There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, so there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) yellow blocks.
3. Let the number of red blocks be \(R\).

The total number of blocks in the tower is the sum of blue, yellow, and red blocks, which is given as 32. So, we can write the equation:

\[4 \text{ (blue)} + 8 \text{ (yellow)} + R \text{ (red)} = 32\]

Now, we can solve for \(R\):

\[4 + 8 + R = 32\]
\[12 + R = 32\]
\[R = 32 - 12\]
\[R = 20\]

So, there are 20 red blocks in the tower.

   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

2. **Distance traveled east:**
   - Time: 8 hours
   - Speed: 18 mph
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

3. **Net distance from the house:**
   - Distance traveled west: 90 miles
   - Distance traveled east: 144 miles
   - Net distance = Distance east - Distance west = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Elvis is now 54 miles from his house."
"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and apply it to the boat's value step by step.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - Initial value: $9000
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700 \)
   - Value after first year: \( 9000 - 2700 = 6300 \)

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the second year: $6300
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890 \)
   - Value after second year: \( 6300 - 1890 = 4410 \)

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the third year: $4410
   - Depreciation rate: 20%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 4410 \times 0.20 = 882 \)
   - Value after third year: \( 4410 - 882 = 3528 \)

The boat is worth $3528 after the three years."
"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to determine the quantities of the other colored candies.

1. Red candies: 54
2. Orange candies: Twice the amount of red candies, so \(2 \times 54 = 108\)
3. Yellow candies: Half as many as red candies, so \(\frac{54}{2} = 27\)

Now, we add up the red, orange, and yellow candies:
\[54 + 108 + 27 = 189\]

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
\[232 - 189 = 43\]

Therefore, the number of pink candies is 43."
"To find out how much Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost for each and then add them together.

1. **Hotel Cost:**
   - Helen booked a hotel for 3 nights.
   - The cost for one night at the hotel is $80.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the hotel is \(3 \times 80 = 240\) dollars.

2. **Bus Travel Cost:**
   - Helen rode the bus 7 times.
   - Each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel.
   - The cost of one bus trip is \(80 \times 0.10 = 8\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the bus travels is \(7 \times 8 = 56\) dollars.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - The total cost for the hotel and bus travels is the sum of the hotel cost and the bus travel cost.
   - Total cost = Hotel cost + Bus travel cost = \(240 + 56 = 296\) dollars.

Therefore, Helen paid a total of **296 dollars** for the hotel and bus travels during her trip."
"Mazie initially has 52 marbles. Dallas ends up with 21 marbles after dropping 4, which means before dropping the marbles, Dallas had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles.

Since Mazie gave all her marbles to Dallas and Darla, and Dallas received 25 marbles, the remaining marbles were given to Darla.

So, the number of marbles given to Darla is 52 - 25 = 27.

Therefore, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the daily feed consumption for one pig:**
   Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day. So, the daily feed consumption for one pig is:
   \[
   4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the daily feed consumption for all five pigs:**
   Since Dexter has five pigs, the total daily feed consumption is:
   \[
   8 \text{ pounds/day/pig} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}

\[ 20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many more hot dogs John needs to buy, considering he already has 4 hot dogs left over. So, the number of additional hot dogs needed is:

\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Since each pack contains 6 hot dogs, the number of packs required is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of the hot dogs. Each pack costs $2, so the total cost is:

\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs."

Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer. Therefore, her height before the summer was:

\[ 70 - 3 = 67 \text{ inches} \]

So, Jackie was 67 inches tall before the summer."
"To find out how much money the company will receive for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bars produced in one day.
2. Calculate the number of bars produced in two weeks.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the produced bars.

Step 1: The company produces 5000 bars per day.

Step 2: There are 14 days in two weeks, so the total number of bars produced in two weeks is:
\[ 5000 \text{ bars/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 70000 \text{ bars} \]

Step 3: The company sells each bar for $2, so the total revenue is:
\[ 70000 \text{ bars} \times \$2/\text{bar} = \$140000 \]

Therefore, the company will receive \(\$140000\) for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a ""buy one get one 50% off"" deal. The original price of each T-shirt is $8.

- The first T-shirt costs $8.
- The second T-shirt is 50% off, so it costs $8 * 0.50 = $4.

The total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The shoes are 40% off the original price of $40.

- The discount on the shoes is $40 * 0.40 = $16.
- The sale price of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Finally, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends:

- Total cost = $12 (T-shirts) + $24 (shoes) = $36.

The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36."
"First, let's calculate how much money Ryan has earned from his allowance over 3 weeks. Since he earns $6 each week, over 3 weeks he earns:

\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ryan uses this money to buy ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends. Each ice cream cone costs $1.25, so the total cost for 4 ice cream cones is:

\[ 1.25 \times 4 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the ice cream from his total allowance, we find out how much money Ryan has left:

\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, Ryan and his 3 friends want to go to the movies. The cost of one movie ticket is $6.50. To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining $13, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one movie ticket:

\[ 13 \div 6.50 = 2 \]

Therefore, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."
"To find out how much Ellen and Lani spent in all, we need to add up the costs of all the items they bought.

First, let's calculate the total amount Ellen spent:
- Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100.
- Ellen also bought a photo frame for $5.
So, Ellen's total is $100 + $5 = $105.

Next, let's calculate the total amount Lani spent:
- Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30.
- Lani also bought two bathrobes, each costing $100, so the total for the bathrobes is $100 + $100 = $200.
So, Lani's total is $30 + $200 = $230.

Now, we add Ellen's total and Lani's total to find the overall amount spent:
- Ellen's total: $105
- Lani's total: $230
So, the total amount spent is $105 + $230 = $335.

Therefore, Ellen and Lani spent a total of $335."
"To calculate the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of the honey and jam mix, we need to first determine the cost of ingredients for one jar and then calculate the total cost and revenue for 10 jars.

**Cost of ingredients for one jar:**

- Passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20

Total cost for one jar = $12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44

**Revenue from selling one jar:**

- Selling price of one jar = $50

**Profit from one jar:**

- Profit = Revenue - Cost = $50 - $44 = $6

**Profit from 10 jars:**

- Total profit = Profit per jar * Number of jars = $6 * 10 = $60

**Final numerical answer:**

$60"
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to convert each type of coin into its dollar value and then sum these values.

1. **Quarters**: Each quarter is worth $0.25. Justin has 32 quarters.
   \[
   32 \times 0.25 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth $0.10. Justin has 95 dimes.
   \[
   95 \times 0.10 = 9.50 \text{ dollars}

First, let's add up her expenses:
- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets (2 tickets at $7.50 each): $7.50 * 2 = $15.00
- Bracelet: $8.50

Total spent = $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00

Now, subtract the total spent from the $40 she was given:
$40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00

Janet has $13.00 left."
"Josh is open 5 days a week (Monday through Saturday). In 2 weeks, he would be open for \(5 \times 2 = 10\) days. He services 3 cars a day, so in 10 days, he services \(3 \times 10 = 30\) cars. Since he gets paid $4 per car, his total earnings in 2 weeks would be \(30 \times 4 = 120\).

Therefore, Josh makes $120 in 2 weeks."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, Randy has:
   - 9 oatmeal cookies
   - 4 chocolate chip cookies
   - 5 sugar cookies

2. Randy ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor:
   - Oatmeal: 9 - 1 = 8
   - Chocolate chip: 4 - 1 = 3
   - Sugar: 5 - 1 = 4

3. He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
   - Oatmeal: 8 - 2 = 6

4. He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
   - Sugar: 4 - 2 = 2

5. He bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner:
   - Oatmeal: 6 + 4 = 10
   - Chocolate chip: 3 + 4 = 7
   - Sugar: 2 + 4 = 6

Now, let's add up the total number of cookies Randy has:
- Oatmeal: 10
- Chocolate chip: 7
- Sugar: 6

Total cookies = 10 + 7 + 6 = 23

Randy has 23 cookies now."
"Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers. He would sell half of them at $5 each and the other half at $7 each.

Half of 12 is 6, so he would sell 6 toy soldiers at $5 each and 6 toy soldiers at $7 each.

The money earned from selling 6 toy soldiers at $5 each is:
6 * $5 = $30

The money earned from selling 6 toy soldiers at $7 each is:
6 * $7 = $42

The total money earned would be:
$30 + $42 = $72

Matthew would earn $72."
"First, let's calculate the total number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate gets home, he starts filling holes at a rate of 9 holes a day, but the dog continues to dig 6 new holes each night. This means that each day, the net change in the number of holes is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes filled} - 6 \text{ holes dug} = 3 \text{ holes filled per day} \]

Now, we need to determine how many days it takes to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes."
"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School, and Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 \]

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = 3000 \]

Now, to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract the average enrollment of Butler High School from that of Norman High School:

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 4000 - 3000 \]

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 1000 \]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School."
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made: 7995
Rainbow cookies: 2595
Oatmeal cookies: 3075

Now, let's subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total:

7995 - 2595 - 3075 = 2325

So, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which is \(16 / 2 = 8\) test tubes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, which is \(14 + 2 = 16\) Petri dishes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, but some were lost, so let's denote the number of beakers Igor actually brought as \(x\).

The total number of items on the lab bench is the sum of the test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes, which is given as 29. So, we can write the equation:

\[8 + x + 16 = 29\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[24 + x = 29\]

To find \(x\), we subtract 24 from both sides:

\[x = 29 - 24\]
\[x = 5\]

So, Igor brought 5 beakers to the lab bench. Since Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, the number of beakers Igor lost is:

\[7 - 5 = 2\]

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of legs for all tables:**
   - Each table has 4 legs.
   - James is putting together 4 tables.
   - Therefore, the total number of legs is \(4 \text{ legs/table} \times 4 \text{ tables} = 16 \text{ legs}\).

2. **Calculate the total number of screws needed:**
   - Each leg needs 2 screws.
   - Therefore, the total number of screws needed is \(16 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 32 \text{ screws}\).

3. **Calculate the number of screws left over:**
   - James has 40 screws.
   - He needs 32 screws.
   - Therefore, the number of screws left over is \(40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws}\).

Final answer: 8 screws will be left over."
"There are 10 eggs in the first basket. The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first, so it has 2 * 10 = 20 eggs. 

To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket: 10 + 20 = 30.

30"
"First, let's determine how much each person raised:

- Alexandra raises $430.
- Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.
- Sarah raises $300.
- Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add up the amounts raised by all of them:

- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: $750
- Maryam: $700
- Sarah: $300

Total amount raised = $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180

Therefore, the total amount of money they all raised is $2180."
"First, let's determine how far Aaron ran. Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, and Vanessa ran 4 miles, Aaron ran half of that distance, which is 2 miles.

Next, we know that Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. If Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes, then he took 8 minutes to run each mile (16 minutes / 2 miles = 8 minutes per mile).

Since Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa would take twice as long to run each mile. Therefore, Vanessa took 16 minutes to run each mile (8 minutes * 2 = 16 minutes per mile).

Vanessa ran 4 miles, so the total time she took to complete her part of the race is 4 miles * 16 minutes per mile = 64 minutes.

Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race."
"To determine how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we first calculate the total amount of line required based on the length of the dock. Since he needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total line required is:

\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we subtract the amount of line he already has from the total amount required:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."

- Cost of meals per reservation: \(2 \times \$5 = \$10\)
- Cost of wine per reservation: \$5
- Total cost per reservation: \(\$10 + \$5 = \$15\)

Next, calculate the total cost for all reservations per night:
- Total cost per night: \(6 \times \$15 = \$90\)

Now, calculate the total cost for the restaurant per week:
- Total cost per week: \(2 \times \$90 = \$180\)

Therefore, the restaurant makes \(\$180\) a week if they are open 2 days a week."
"First, let's calculate the cost price of each watermelon. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = \$1.60 \]

Next, we need to find the selling price per watermelon, which includes a 25% profit. To find the selling price, we calculate 25% of the cost price and add it to the cost price:

\[ \text{Profit per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 0.25 = \$0.40 \]

\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 + 0.40 = \$2.00 \]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.00."
"First, let's determine Dora's current age. If Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

James is twice as old as Dora, so James is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.

John had James when he was 19, so John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

John had his youngest son when he was 32, so his youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost is $400, and he gets it at 80% off.

The discount amount is:
\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

So, the cost of the radiator after the discount is:
\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

The labor cost is:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total amount Mark paid:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is:
\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

We know the following:
1. The total number of animals is 20, so \( C + K = 20 \).
2. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70, so \( 2C + 4K = 70 \).

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can express \( K \) in terms of \( C \) from the first equation:
\[ K = 20 - C \]

Next, we substitute \( K \) in the second equation:
\[ 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70 \]
\[ 2C + 80 - 4C = 70 \]
\[ -2C + 80 = 70 \]
\[ -2C = 70 - 80 \]
\[ -2C = -10 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, there are 5 chickens. To find the number of cows, we substitute \( C = 5 \) back into the equation \( K = 20 - C \):
\[ K = 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of chickens is 5.
