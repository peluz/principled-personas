"First, let's determine how many eggs Janet has left after using some for breakfast and baking muffins.

1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
2. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
3. She uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends.

So, the total number of eggs used is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Subtract the used eggs from the total eggs laid:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, the total amount she makes from selling the eggs is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, Janet makes \(\boxed{18}\) dollars every day at the farmers' market."

"First, let's calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. An increase of 150% means the value increased by \(1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000\).

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we need to account for the $50,000 Josh spent on repairs. The total cost for Josh is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. He does this 3 times a week. 

First, calculate the total distance he runs in one session:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints/session} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters/session} \]

Next, calculate the total distance he runs in a week:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

So, the total meters James runs a week is:
\[ 540 \text{ meters} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of feed each chicken consumes in a day. Since each chicken is given 3 cups of feed per meal and there are 3 meals a day, each chicken consumes:

\[ 3 \text{ cups/meal} \times 3 \text{ meals/day} = 9 \text{ cups/day} \]

Given that Wendi has 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement for the entire flock is:

\[ 9 \text{ cups/chicken/day} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 180 \text{ cups/day} \]

Next, we know the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:

- Morning: 15 cups
- Afternoon: 25 cups

The total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:

\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the morning and afternoon feed from the total daily requirement:

\[ 180 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 140 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens \(\boxed{140}\) cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5.

First, calculate the cost of the second glass:
\[ 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how many glasses cost $5 and how many cost $3. Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, and every second glass is at a reduced price, we can divide 16 by 2 to find out how many glasses are at each price:
\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ glasses at } 5 \text{ dollars each and 8 glasses at } 3 \text{ dollars each} \]

Now, calculate the total cost for the glasses priced at $5:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, calculate the total cost for the glasses priced at $3:
\[ 8 \times 3 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, add the two amounts together to find the total cost:
\[ 40 + 24 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"Given that Seattle has 20 sheep, we can determine the number of sheep in Charleston and Toulouse based on the relationships provided.

1. **Seattle's Sheep**: 20 sheep.
2. **Charleston's Sheep**: Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Charleston's Sheep} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ sheep}
   \]
3. **Toulouse's Sheep**: Since Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Toulouse's Sheep} = 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ sheep}
   \]

Now, we sum the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
\[
\text{Total Sheep} = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260
\]

**Final Answer**: 260"
"First, let's calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the file at the normal rate of 2 GB/minute.

40% of 200 GB is:
\[ 200 \times 0.40 = 80 \text{ GB} \]

The time to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute is:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

After downloading 80 GB, Windows forces a restart, which takes 20 minutes. Then, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning, so she needs to download the entire 200 GB again.

The time to download the entire 200 GB at 2 GB/minute is:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the time for the initial 40% download, the restart, and the full download again, the total time is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 160 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time to download the file is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"First, let's calculate the distance John initially travels to the point where he turns around.

John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

So, John is 180 miles away from home when he turns around.

Next, we need to determine how far John travels back towards home in the 4 hours he spends trying to get home.

John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered during this time:
\[ \text{Distance covered in standstill traffic} = 0 \, \text{miles} \]

Then, he drives for the next 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at a speed of 30 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After this, he drives for the remaining 1.5 hours (since 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours) at a speed of 80 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we sum up the distances he has covered towards home:
\[ \text{Total distance covered towards home} = 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Since he was initially 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:
\[ \text{Distance from home} = 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"First, we calculate Eliza's regular earnings for the first 40 hours. Her regular rate is $10 per hour.

\[ \text{Regular earnings} = 40 \, \text{hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

Next, we calculate her overtime pay. She worked 5 hours of overtime (45 total hours - 40 regular hours).

Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate.

\[ \text{Overtime rate} = 1.2 \times \$10 = \$12/\text{hour} \]

Now, we calculate her earnings for the 5 hours of overtime.

\[ \text{Overtime earnings} = 5 \, \text{hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Finally, we add her regular earnings and her overtime earnings to find her total earnings for the week.

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are \(\boxed{460}\)."
"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times the first month, which is:
\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \]

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, so the program had 70% of the second month's downloads:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

The total number of downloads over the three months is:
\[ 366 \]"
"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = \( 3 \times 68 = 204 \) dollars.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \) dollars.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = \( 6 \times 55 = 330 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up the total costs for each type of pastry to get the overall total cost:

\[
204 + 160 + 330 = 694
\]

The total cost is \(\boxed{694}\) dollars."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit becomes positive.

1. **Initial Cost**: The tree costs $90 to plant.
2. **Annual Growth and Revenue**: Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Expenses**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

The net profit each year is the revenue minus the expenses:
\[
\text{Net profit per year} = \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5
\]

To find out how many years it will take to recover the initial cost of $90, we divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:
\[
\text{Number of years} = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5/\text{year}} = 12 \text{ years}
\]

Therefore, it will take **12 years** before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree."
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners at the green house. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. So, she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house. This means she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. According to the problem, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
   To clear the fraction, multiply both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 3:
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners."
"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we have:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after accounting for those who enrolled in contemporary dance:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Of these remaining 16 students, 25% enrolled in jazz dance. So, the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance is:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Now, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students to find out how many enrolled in hip-hop dance:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the following calculation:

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

\[ 60\% \]"
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the profit from each purchase option after the market increase.

1. **Jewelry Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value after increase: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125
   - Profit: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

2. **Electronic Gadgets Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value after increase: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096
   - Profit: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize profit, which would be $125 at the end of the month.

**Final Answer:**
$125"
"Each train travels 80 miles westward and then 150 miles northward over the two days. 

To find the total distance covered by each train, we add the distances together:

\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her earnings from both her teaching and coaching jobs.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- Jill earns $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
\[ 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} = 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- Jill earns $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
\[ 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours/week} = 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from coaching are:
\[ 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Finally, to find her total annual salary, we add her earnings from both jobs:
\[ 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} + 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} = 57500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is:
\[ \boxed{57500} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of eggs Claire uses in a week. Since she makes a 3 egg omelet every morning, and there are 7 days in a week, she uses:

\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we calculate the number of eggs she uses in 4 weeks:

\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

To convert the number of eggs into dozens, we divide by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12 eggs):

\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks."
"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance and the total time required for the hike:**
   - Total distance = 12 miles
   - Desired average speed = 4 miles per hour
   - Total time required = Total distance / Desired average speed = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours

2. **Calculate the time already spent:**
   - Time spent on the first 4 miles = 1 hour
   - Time spent on the next 2 miles = 1 hour
   - Total time spent so far = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

3. **Determine the remaining time needed to complete the hike:**
   - Remaining time = Total time required - Time already spent = 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   - Total distance = 12 miles
   - Distance already covered = 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles
   - Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance already covered = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles

5. **Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance:**
   - Required speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time = 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire hike.

**Final answer:**
6 miles per hour"
"First, let's determine the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink before any is spilled. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the orange drink is:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters}
\]

After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the remaining volume of the orange drink is:

\[
10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters}
\]

The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters}
\]

Next, let's determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:

\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters}
\]

Now, we add the water from both the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink to find the total amount of water in the 24 liters of mixed drink:

\[
6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters}
\]

Thus, the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:

\[
\boxed{15}

"To determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Raymond's current age.
2. Determine the age of Raymond's son when he was born.
3. Calculate the difference between Samantha's current age and the age of Raymond's son when he was born.

First, we know that Samantha is currently 31 years old. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond's current age is:
\[ 31 - 6 = 25 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we know that Raymond had his son at the age of 23. Therefore, the age of Raymond's son when he was born is 23 years before Raymond's current age:
\[ 25 - 23 = 2 \text{ years old} \]

This means Raymond's son was born 2 years ago. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"

Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday."
"The candle burns for 4 hours from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Since it melts by 2 centimeters every hour, the total reduction in length is:

\[ 2 \, \text{cm/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 8 \, \text{cm} \]

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM."
"Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

Given that Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after a 25% discount, this means he paid 75% of the original price. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find the original price \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \):

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

\[ P = 26.00 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered, excluding the boxes of pizza.

1. The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
2. The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
3. The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together, the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. Therefore, the amount spent on the boxes of pizza is:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is:
\[\frac{17}{8.50} = 2\]

So, Marie ordered \(\boxed{2}\) boxes of pizza."

   - Sum of the total costs for shorts, pants, and shoes.
   - Total cost = \( 49.50 + 67.50 + 126 = 243 \) dollars.

Therefore, Mishka spent a total of \( \boxed{243} \) dollars on all the clothing items."
"Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. Over 60 days, she will consume 60 servings of ice cream.

Each carton contains 15 servings and costs $4.00. To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Since each carton costs $4.00, the total cost for 4 cartons is:

\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00/\text{carton} = \$16.00 \]

After 60 days, Cynthia will spend \(\boxed{16}\) dollars on ice cream."
"Henry's total trip is 60 miles. He stopped after 20 miles, so the distance remaining after the first stop is:

\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \text{ miles} \]

His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, which means he had traveled 15 miles from his second stop to the end. Therefore, the distance between his first and second stops is:

\[ 40 - 15 = 25 \text{ miles} \]

So, Henry traveled \(\boxed{25}\) miles between his first and second stops."
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total cost of the two pairs of high heels as:
\[ 33 + 2 \times 33 = B - 5 \]

First, calculate the cost of the two pairs of high heels:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Therefore, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we start by defining the variables for Darrell and Allen's current ages. Let Darrell's current age be \(7x\) and Allen's current age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

Given that the total of their current ages is 162, we can write the equation:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we can find Allen's current age by substituting \(x = 9\) into the expression for Allen's age:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"First, let's determine the guesses of each friend:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we sum these guesses and divide by the number of guesses:

\[
\text{Sum of guesses} = 80 + 60 + 100 = 240
\]

\[
\text{Number of guesses} = 3
\]

\[
\text{Average guess} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

The average guess is 80."
"First, calculate the daily care hours for one dog:
\[ 0.5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Since John takes care of 10 dogs, the total daily care hours are:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog/day} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, calculate the weekly care hours by multiplying the daily care hours by the number of days in a week:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, John spends:
\[ \boxed{35} \text{ hours a week} \]
taking care of the dogs."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations based on the information given:
\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:
\[ G = S + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

70"
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Raymond has 40 jewels. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Then, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, we subtract 2 from this number to find out how many jewels Siobhan has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Therefore, Siobhan has \(\boxed{23}\) jewels."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points.

25% of 4 points is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{25}{100} = 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \text{ point} \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Adding the points from both halves of the game:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \text{ points} \]

Therefore, the total points Mike scored is:
\[ 9 \]"
"Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Over 30 days, he will consume:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

The sale price is 4 yogurts for $5.00. To find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, Terry spends \(\boxed{75}\) dollars on yogurt over 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his lego sets. He sells 13 lego sets at $15 each:

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 8 video games he buys. Each video game costs $20:

\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \]

John has $5 left after buying the video games. This means the money he spent on the video games plus the $5 left equals the total money he had from selling the lego sets:

\[ 160 + 5 = 165 \]

Since the total money from selling the lego sets is $195, and he spent $165, we can confirm the calculation is correct. The question asks how many lego sets he still has. Since he sold all 13 lego sets, the number of lego sets he still has is:

\[ 13 - 13 = 0 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day. Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day. So, the distance he runs each of these days is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = \frac{3v}{2} \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   The total distance John runs in a week is the sum of the distances run on each of the three days:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying the expression:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v + 3v}{2} = 3v + 3v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Given total distance:**
   We know that John runs 60 miles a week. Therefore:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]

5. **Solving for \( v \):**
   \[
   v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

So, John runs at a speed of \( \boxed{10} \) miles per hour."
"First, let's determine Dana's running and walking speeds based on her skipping speed.

Given:
- Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
- Her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed.

So, her running speed is:
\[ 3 \text{ mph} \times 2 = 6 \text{ mph} \]

Next, her walking speed is four times slower than her running speed:
\[ 6 \text{ mph} \div 4 = 1.5 \text{ mph} \]

Now, let's calculate the time spent running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking in a six-hour period.

Time spent running:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Time spent walking:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the distance she can travel at each speed.

Distance running:
\[ 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Distance walking:
\[ 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances to find the total distance traveled in six hours:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"If Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben’s iPhone is two times older than Suzy’s iPhone, then Ben’s iPhone is \(1 \times 2 = 2\) years old.

Since Brandon’s iPhone is four times as old as Ben’s iPhone, Brandon’s iPhone is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) years old.

Therefore, Brandon’s iPhone is 8 years old."
"When Polly is not holding the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the gold javelin for a distance of 400 feet. When she holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, the throwing distance with the gemstone is:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames can reach up to 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the throwing distance with the gemstone:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

200 feet"
"First, calculate the total number of pie pieces available initially. Since Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, subtract the remaining pieces from the initial total:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

\[ 26 \]"
"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total calories from the bag of chips:**
   - Each serving has 250 calories.
   - There are 5 servings in a 300g bag.
   - Total calories in the bag = 250 calories/serving * 5 servings = 1250 calories.

2. **Determine the remaining calories you can consume:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Remaining calories = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

3. **Calculate how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining calories:**
   - The bag contains 1250 calories for 300g.
   - Calories per gram = 1250 calories / 300g = 4.17 calories/g.
   - Grams you can eat = 200 calories / 4.17 calories/g ≈ 48 grams.

Therefore, you can eat approximately 48 grams of chips."
"First, let's determine how many pounds of beeswax Charlie needs to make 20 candles. Since he can make 10 candles per pound of beeswax, we can calculate the pounds of beeswax needed as follows:

\[
\text{Pounds of beeswax needed} = \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the supplies. Since one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00, for 2 pounds, the cost is:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pound} = \$20.00
\]

Now, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00
\]

Finally, we find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

\[
\text{Net profit} = \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00
\]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"First, let's determine the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

- **Monday**: Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday**: She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
  \[
  5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7
  \]
- **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is:
  \[
  2 \times 7 = 14
  \]

Next, we calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[
5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles}
\]

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
\[
26 \times 4 = 104 \text{ hours}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
104

"To determine how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Post-it Notes**: Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
2. **Post-it Notes Used at Work**: She used 220 Post-it notes at work.
3. **Remaining Post-it Notes**: After all the usage, she had 23 Post-it notes left.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased as \( x \).

The total number of Post-it notes she had before using any at work is the sum of the initial notes and the notes from the package:
\[ 80 + x \]

After using 220 Post-it notes at work, the number of Post-it notes left is:
\[ (80 + x) - 220 \]

We know that after using the notes, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining:
\[ (80 + x) - 220 = 23 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is:
\[ \boxed{163} \]"
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, the number of blue ties he bought is:

\[
\frac{200}{40} = 5 \text{ blue ties}
\]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[
2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ red ties}
\]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the red ties. Since he bought 10 red ties and each costs $60, the total cost for the red ties is:

\[
10 \times 60 = 600 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[
200 + 600 = 800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:

\[
\boxed{800}

"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, a 4-foot piece of wire is:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from 48 inches of wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:

\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Tracy obtained \(\boxed{8}\) pieces of wire."
"First, let's calculate the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, the total number of units is:

\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many dozens of eggs Lloyd produces per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we calculate how much Lloyd makes per day by selling these dozens of eggs at $2 per dozen:

\[ 21 \text{ dozen} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$42 \]

To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7):

\[ \$42 \times 7 = \$294 \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\$294\) per week from selling eggs."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM and then calculate the time it takes for him to travel back at 6 mph.

1. **Calculate the distance traveled from 1 to 4 PM:**
   - Tom's ship travels at 10 miles per hour.
   - He travels from 1 PM to 4 PM, which is a total of 3 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 10 mph × 3 hours = 30 miles.

2. **Calculate the time to travel back:**
   - The return trip is also 30 miles, but at a speed of 6 mph.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours.

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more weight needs to be removed to reach the total of 15 pounds. This can be calculated by subtracting the weight of the comic books from the total weight:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound, the number of toys Uriah needs to remove to remove the remaining 7.5 pounds is:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

The final numerical answer is:

  \]

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:

- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 each:
  \[
  12 \times 40 = 480
  \]
- Total revenue on Friday:
  \[
  480
  \]

Now, we need to find out how much more revenue was earned on the day with higher revenue. The revenue on Thursday is $520 and on Friday is $480. The difference in revenue is:
\[
520 - 480 = 40
\]

Therefore, the mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday."
"The Doubtfire sisters initially have 7 kittens. Their mother informs them that their two house cats, Patchy and Trixie, have had kittens as well. Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which means Patchy has \(3 \times 7 = 21\) kittens. Trixie has had 12 kittens.

To find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we add the kittens from the adopted ones and the house cats:

\[7 + 21 + 12 = 40\]

The final numerical answer is:

   \]

2. **Determine the weight of the empty truck and the driver:**
   \[
   \text{Weight of the empty truck and driver} = 3755 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining weight capacity of the truck:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining weight capacity} = \text{Bridge weight limit} - \text{Weight of the empty truck and driver}

"First, let's calculate the amount Aleena pays for the first half of the year. Since the streaming service charges $140 per month, for 6 months, the total cost is:
\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine the reduced monthly charge for the second half of the year. The company charges 10% less, so the new monthly charge is:
\[ 140 \times (1 - 0.10) = 140 \times 0.90 = 126 \text{ dollars} \]

For the second half of the year, which is also 6 months, the total cost is:
\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the costs of both halves of the year gives the total amount paid by Aleena for the streaming service by the end of the year:
\[ 840 + 756 = 1596 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:

"First, let's break down the time Jim spends on TV and reading each time he does this activity.

1. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
2. He then reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is \(2 \div 2 = 1\) hour.

So, each time he does this, he spends a total of \(2 + 1 = 3\) hours on TV and reading.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent in a week is:
\[3 \text{ hours/time} \times 3 \text{ times/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week}\]

To find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:

1. Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys').
2. Each team has 5 players.
3. Each school also sends 1 coach for each team.

So, for each school:
- Number of players = 5 (girls) + 5 (boys) = 10 players
- Number of coaches = 1 (girls) + 1 (boys) = 2 coaches

Therefore, for each school:
- Total number of people = 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people

Since there are 4 schools:
- Total number of people = 12 people/school * 4 schools = 48 people

Next, we need to find the number of emeralds. The problem states that there are twice the number of emeralds as the rubies. Therefore, the number of emeralds is:

\[ \text{Number of emeralds} = 2 \times 140 = 280 \]

Now, we can find the total number of gems by adding the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together:

\[ \text{Total number of gems} = 175 + 140 + 280 = 595 \]

Therefore, the total number of gems in the chest is:

\[ \boxed{595} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of boys at Dr. Wertz's school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, the number of boys is:

\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Next, we find the total number of students by adding the number of boys and girls:

\[ 120 + 60 = 180 \]

Given that there are 5 students for every teacher, we can find the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by 5:

\[ \frac{180}{5} = 36 \]

Therefore, the number of teachers is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"

   \]

Therefore, Bailey started with $60."
"First, let's calculate the number of classes Judy teaches in a week.

- From Monday to Friday, she teaches 5 classes each day. So, for 5 days, she teaches \(5 \times 5 = 25\) classes.
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.

So, the total number of classes in a week is \(25 + 8 = 33\).

Next, we calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week. Since each class has 15 students, the total number of students is \(33 \times 15 = 495\).

Judy charges $15.00 per student. Therefore, the total amount of money she makes in a week is \(495 \times 15 = 7425\).

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[

Next, calculate the money raised from selling cheesecake slices:
\[ 23 \text{ slices} \times \$4 \text{ per slice} = \$92 \]

Now, add the two amounts together to find the total money raised:
\[ \$129 + \$92 = \$221 \]

Therefore, Tommy raises a total of \$221."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones without interest:

\[ 5 \text{ cell phones} \times \$150 \text{ per cell phone} = \$750 \]

Next, we calculate the total interest charged on the purchase. The interest rate is 2% per unit, and since there are five units, the total interest is:

\[ 5 \times 2\% \times \$150 = 5 \times 0.02 \times \$150 = \$15 \]

So, the total amount Shiela will pay is the sum of the original cost and the interest:

\[ \$750 + \$15 = \$765 \]

Since Shiela will pay this amount in 3 monthly installments, the monthly payment is:

\[ \frac{\$765}{3} = \$255 \]

Therefore, Shiela will pay each month:

\[ \$255 \]"

Therefore, the total amount Artie will make is \(\boxed{88}\)."
"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given:
- The top level (4th level) has a square footage of 16 square feet.
- Each level has half the square footage of the level below it.

Let's calculate the square footage for each level:
1. 4th level: 16 square feet
2. 3rd level: \(16 \times 2 = 32\) square feet
3. 2nd level: \(32 \times 2 = 64\) square feet
4. 1st level: \(64 \times 2 = 128\) square feet

Now, we sum the square footage of all levels:
\[16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240\]

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[\text{Average square footage} = \frac{240}{4} = 60\]

Therefore, the average square footage of a level is:
\[60\]"
"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then find out how many bags this amount corresponds to.

1. **Calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:**
   - Cecilia feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days.
   - Total dog food for the first 180 days = \( 1 \, \text{cup/day} \times 180 \, \text{days} = 180 \, \text{cups} \).

2. **Determine the number of bags needed for the first 180 days:**
   - One bag contains 110 cups of dog food.
   - Number of bags needed = \( \frac{180 \, \text{cups}}{110 \, \text{cups/bag}} \approx 1.636 \, \text{bags} \).

Since Cecilia cannot purchase a fraction of a bag, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, she will need 2 bags of dog food for the first 180 days.

**Final numerical answer:**

"Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, we can calculate the amount of laundry Raymond and David do based on the given relationships.

1. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.
   - Let \( D \) be the amount of laundry David does.
   - Therefore, \( 4D = 400 \) pounds.
   - Solving for \( D \), we get \( D = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \) pounds.

2. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.
   - Let \( R \) be the amount of laundry Raymond does.
   - Therefore, \( R = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \) pounds.

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:
\[ R - D = 200 - 100 = 100 \]

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds."
"To determine how much money Vincent saves, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in the most economical way versus the less economical way.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:
- Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
- Total cost: \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15.00 \)

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1.00 each:
- Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
- Total cost: \( 9 \times 1.00 = 9.00 \)

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two methods:
- Cost difference: \( 15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00 \)

Therefore, Vincent saves \(\boxed{6.00}\) dollars by buying 18 flowers at the better price."
"The original cost of the grooming is $100. With a 30% discount, the cost is reduced by 30% of $100.

First, calculate the discount amount:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.30 \times 100 = 30 \]

Subtract the discount from the original cost:
\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \]

So, the grooming cost after the discount is:

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can express these as equations:
\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"To determine the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of rings for each of the three alarms and then sum them up.

1. **First alarm:**
   - The first alarm rang 4 times.

2. **Second alarm:**
   - The second alarm rang for three times as long as the first alarm.
   - Since the first alarm rang 4 times, the second alarm also rang 4 times (assuming the number of rings is proportional to the duration).

3. **Third alarm:**
   - The third alarm rang for half as long as the second alarm.
   - Since the second alarm rang 4 times, the third alarm rang \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) times.

Now, we sum the number of rings from all three alarms:
\[ 4 \text{ (first alarm)} + 4 \text{ (second alarm)} + 2 \text{ (third alarm)} = 10 \]

Thus, the total number of times the alarm rang is \(\boxed{10}\)."

The total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies."
"First, we need to determine how many guests are expected to show up. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, 3/4 of the guests will attend. 

Christina invited 16 friends, so the number of guests expected to show up is:

4. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is \(9 - 5 = 4\) years old.

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old."
"First, we need to determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, and Lee's current time is 38 seconds, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's current time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to calculate Gerald's new time after his speed improved by 10%. An improvement in speed by 10% means that Gerald can now run 10% faster, which is equivalent to running 90% of his original time:

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = \text{Gerald's original time} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \text{ seconds} \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in \(\boxed{36}\) seconds."
"Given that the number of dogs is 60, and there are two cats for every dog, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 × Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 × 60 = 120

Next, we need to find the combined number of pet dogs and cats:
Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats:
Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

Finally, we calculate the total number of pets in the neighborhood:
Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in Grade 5.

The total number of students is 200. According to the problem, \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the students are boys. Therefore, the number of boys is:

Since the rest of the students are girls, the number of girls is:
\[ 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. The problem states that \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the girls are in the girl scout. Therefore, the number of girls in the girl scout is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ 120 - 80 = 40 \]

So, the number of girls not in the girl scout is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"First, we need to calculate how many hours James slept. Since James slept \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept, and Harry slept 9 hours, we can calculate James's sleep as follows:

\[ \text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James. We do this by subtracting the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the volume loss**: Each can of tomatoes loses half its volume when turned into sauce. Therefore, the 16 ounces of tomatoes in each can produce 8 ounces of sauce.

2. **Calculate the number of cans used**: Since each can produces 8 ounces of sauce, and Freda's batch made 32 ounces of sauce, we can find the number of cans used by dividing the total volume of sauce by the volume produced per can:
   \[
   \text{Number of cans} = \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of tomatoes per can**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes.

4. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes**: Multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can:
   \[
   \text{Total number of tomatoes} = 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}

Therefore, Freda used \(\boxed{12}\) tomatoes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We start with 30 cars on the motorway.
2. After 15 minutes, some cars drive through the traffic jam.
3. In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through the traffic jam.
4. Additionally, 5 cars take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in both 15-minute intervals is \( x + 20 \).

Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that actually drove through the traffic jam is the total number of cars minus the 5 that took an exit. This can be expressed as:
\[ 30 - 5 = 25 \]

Therefore, we have the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Mary initially has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. Therefore, the total number of potted plants she has is:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

"First, let's determine how many times the second friend pressed the doorbell. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times, so:

\[ \text{Additional presses by the second friend} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]

Therefore, the second friend pressed the doorbell:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ times} \]

Next, we know the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so:

\[ \text{Presses by the third friend} = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

Now, we sum up all the doorbell presses by each friend:

\[ 20 \text{ (first friend)} + 25 \text{ (second friend)} + 70 \text{ (third friend)} + 60 \text{ (fourth friend)} \]

Adding these together:

\[ 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 \]

So, the total number of doorbell rings is:

"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the given information about the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.

The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. We need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles.

First, we calculate the time it takes to cover 1 mile:
\[ \text{Time per mile} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes to cover 42 miles:
\[ \text{Total time} = 42 \text{ miles} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"First, let's determine how many pieces Poppy places on the board. Since she places a quarter of the pieces, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \]

So, Poppy places 250 pieces on the board. This leaves:

\[ 1000 - 250 = 750 \]

Next, Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining pieces. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \]

After her mom places these pieces, the number of pieces left to be placed is:

\[ 750 - 250 = 500 \]

Therefore, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is:

\[ \boxed{500} \]"

"First, we need to determine the inner dimensions of one box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each dimension to find the inner dimensions (subtracting 1 inch from each side of the length, width, and height).

The inner dimensions of one box are:
- Length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
- Width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

Next, we calculate the inner volume of one box using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is length × width × height:
\[ \text{Volume of one box} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the volume of one box by 3 to find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:
\[ \text{Total inner volume} = 24 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"Let's break down the time Frankie spent watching TV each day:

- **Monday and Tuesday**: 1 hour each night, so \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.
- **Thursday**: 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.
- **Friday**: 2 hours (2 one-hour episodes).

Adding these up, we get:
\[2 \text{ (Monday + Tuesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 5.5 \text{ hours}\]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. Therefore, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
\[7 - 5.5 = 1.5 \text{ hours}\]

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes (0.5 hours), the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
\[1.5 \div 0.5 = 3\]

So, Frankie watched \(\boxed{3}\) 30-minute episodes on Wednesday."
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies. However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 50 \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\)."

"To determine the total number of fruit roll-ups each person ate and then find the average, we need to calculate the area of the roll-ups each person had.

First, calculate the number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice had:
\[ \text{Beatrice's roll-ups} = 2 \text{ (width)} \times 24 \text{ (length)} = 48 \]

Next, calculate the number of fruit roll-ups Marcell had:
\[ \text{Marcell's roll-ups} = 3 \text{ (width)} \times 14 \text{ (length)} = 42 \]

Now, find the total number of fruit roll-ups both ate:
\[ \text{Total roll-ups} = 48 + 42 = 90 \]

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by each person, divide the total by 2:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Therefore, the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is:

"First, we need to determine how many feet Julia rows to reach the shore. Since it took her 64 seconds to reach the shore and it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can calculate the total distance as follows:

\[
\text{Total distance} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds/20 feet}} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much water the boat took on during this journey. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, for 80 feet, the amount of water taken on is:

\[
\text{Water taken on} = \left(\frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 2 \text{ liters} = 8 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters}
\]

Thus, the boat had taken on \(\boxed{16}\) liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:**
   - Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
   - Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   - Therefore, the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is:
     \[
     \frac{1800}{6} = 300
     \]

2. **Determine the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo:**
   - The maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Therefore, we have:
     \[
     300 = 50x
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{300}{50} = 6

"Given that Katy uses sugar and water in the ratio of 7:13, we can represent the amount of sugar and water she uses as 7x and 13x respectively, where x is a common multiplier.

The total amount of sugar and water used is given as 120 teaspoons. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 13x = 120\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[20x = 120\]

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now, to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used, we multiply the value of x by 7 (since the ratio of sugar is 7 parts):

\[7x = 7 \times 6 = 42\]

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is:

"John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children. Since each pair of shoes costs $60, the cost for one child is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) dollars. For 3 children, the total cost is \(3 \times 120 = 360\) dollars.

Therefore, John paid \(\boxed{360}\) dollars."
"On the first day, the customs officer counted 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles on the first day is:
\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

On the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day:
\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles/container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is:

"First, let's determine Lylah's salary four years ago. Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, which was 30% higher than Lylah's salary. Let's denote Lylah's salary four years ago as \( L \).

We know that:
\[ 40000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.3} = 30769.23 \]

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.

Next, we need to find Adrien's salary four years later. Adrien's salary increased by 40% from his salary four years ago. Therefore, his new salary is:
\[ 40000 + 0.4 \times 40000 = 40000 \times 1.4 = 56000 \]

Since Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage, her new salary is:
\[ 30769.23 + 0.4 \times 30769.23 = 30769.23 \times 1.4 = 43076.92 \]

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is the sum of Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries:
\[ 56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92 \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:

We are given that there are 12 blue gumballs, so \( B = 12 \).

Substituting \( B = 12 \) into the equation:
\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of pink gumballs is 70."
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many cars are semi-automatic.

Given:
- Total cars = 20
- Automatic cars = 12
- Manual cars = 4

The number of semi-automatic cars can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total cars} - (\text{Automatic cars} + \text{Manual cars}) \]
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = 20 - (12 + 4) \]
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 16 \]
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = 4 \]

Next, we calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = 0.2 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = 20\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of cars that are semi-automatic is 20%."
"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \). According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so the number of baby bees is \( 2Q \). Additionally, there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees is \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is the sum of the number of queens, baby bees, and worker bees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
To find \( Q \), we divide both sides of the equation by 7:
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]
So, the number of queens is 100. The number of baby bees is \( 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \). The number of worker bees is \( 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \).

Thus, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\)."
"First, let's calculate how many hours Jordan spends playing video games in a week. Since he plays for 2 hours every day, we can calculate the total weekly video game time as follows:

\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jordan would earn if he spent those 14 hours working instead of playing video games. Since he earns $10 per hour at his part-time job, we can calculate his earnings as follows:

\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$140/\text{week} \]

Therefore, if Jordan spent his video game time working instead, he would earn \(\boxed{140}\) dollars in one week."
"First, let's identify the food and non-food items from the list:
- Milk: Food item (2 dollars)
- Eggs: Food item (3 dollars)
- Light bulbs: Non-food item (3 dollars)
- Cups: Non-food item (3 dollars)
- Roach traps: Non-food item (4 dollars)

Next, we calculate the total cost of the non-food items:
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars

Total cost of non-food items = 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Now, we apply the 10% tax to the non-food items:
Tax on non-food items = 10% of 10 dollars = 0.10 * 10 = 1 dollar

So, the total cost of the non-food items including tax is:
10 dollars (original cost) + 1 dollar (tax) = 11 dollars

Now, we add the cost of the food items:
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars

Total cost of food items = 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Finally, we add the total cost of the food items to the total cost of the non-food items including tax:
Total cost = 5 dollars (food) + 11 dollars (non-food with tax) = 16 dollars

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
16 dollars"
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have:
- Kim already has 3 clients.
- He is talking to 5 potential clients.
- Therefore, the total number of clients will be \(3 + 5 = 8\).

Next, we need to determine the total expenses for the cleaning supplies:
- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
- The cost of 1 bottle of bleach is $2.
- The cost of 1 pack of cloths is $5.
- Therefore, the cost for supplies per client is \(2 \times 2 + 1 \times 5 = 4 + 5 = 9\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total expenses for all clients:
- The total number of clients is 8.
- The cost per client is $9.
- Therefore, the total expenses are \(8 \times 9 = 72\) dollars.

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:
- Total income = $92
- Total expenses = $72
- Profit = $92 - $72 = $20

Therefore, the profit Kim will make each week is \(\boxed{20}\) dollars."
"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare that John can harvest in one harvest.
2. Determine how many harvests John can make in a year.
3. Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the number of harvests in a year to get the total number of pineapples harvested in a year.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare.
John has 100 pineapples per hectare.

Step 2: Determine how many harvests John can make in a year.
Since John can harvest every 3 months, and there are 12 months in a year, the number of harvests per year is:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year.
First, calculate the number of pineapples harvested per hectare in a year:
\[ 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \]
Since John has 10 hectares, the total number of pineapples harvested in a year is:
\[ 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

Therefore, the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year is:
\[ \boxed{4000} \]"
"Johnny has three lego sets to pick up. The first set has 500 pieces. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, which means it has \(500 \times 3 = 1500\) pieces. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, which means it has \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

To find the total number of pieces Johnny picks up, we add the pieces from all three sets together:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

So, Johnny picks up a total of 2125 pieces."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Bees leaving: 30 bees

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - Bees returning: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) bees

3. **Following 6 hours:**
   - Bees leaving: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Bees returning: All the bees that left in the previous 12 hours (30 + 60) return.
   - Total bees leaving in the first 12 hours: 30 + 60 = 90 bees
   - Bees returning in the last 6 hours: 90 bees

So, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is \( \boxed{90} \)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets:

- The cost for 1 adult ticket is $12.
- The cost for 1 child ticket is $10.

So, the total cost for both tickets is:
\[ 12 + 10 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means the amount she gave the cashier is the total cost plus the change she received:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier \(\boxed{30}\) dollars."
"First, we need to determine how many Facebook friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the number of Dorothy's friends:

\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

To find Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find out how many friends James has. James has four times as many friends as Dorothy:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of Facebook friends James has is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, we need to convert the distances from miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

For Steve:
- Distance: 3 miles = 3 * 5280 feet = 15840 feet
- Speed: 440 feet per minute
- Time taken: \( \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet per minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \)

For Tim:
- Distance: 2 miles = 2 * 5280 feet = 10560 feet
- Speed: 264 feet per minute
- Time taken: \( \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet per minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \)

Since Steve finishes the race in 36 minutes and Tim finishes in 40 minutes, Steve is the winner. The difference in their times is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at his house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

"First, let's calculate the number of tires inflated for each type of vehicle:

- For bicycles, each has 2 tires. Since 5 people came by to get both tires inflated, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- For tricycles, each has 3 tires. Since 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- For unicycles, each has 1 tire. Since 1 person came by to get their unicycle tire inflated, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Next, we sum the total number of tires inflated:
\[10 \text{ (bicycle tires)} + 9 \text{ (tricycle tires)} + 1 \text{ (unicycle tire)} = 20 \text{ tires}\]

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost for inflating 20 tires is:
\[20 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 500 \text{ cents}\]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert 500 cents to dollars:
\[500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 5 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Shawnda made that day is:
\[5 \text{ dollars}\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys:
\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies/pack} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the cookies:
\[ 60 \text{ cookies} \times \$0.10/\text{cookie} = \$6.00 \]

Now, we determine the change Carl receives if he pays with a $10 bill:
\[ \$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00 \]

Therefore, the change Carl receives is:
\[ \$4.00 \]"
"Let's denote the initial number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants carried off the last remaining fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

Let's work backwards from the end to the beginning:

- After the ants carried off the last fry, 5 fries were left. Before the ants, there were \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) fries.
- Before the raccoon stole two-thirds of the fries, the remaining one-third was 6 fries. So, the number of fries before the raccoon took them was \( 6 \times 3 = 18 \) fries.
- Before the pigeons ate their 9 fries, the number of fries was \( 18 + 9 = 27 \) fries.
- Before the seagull ate its 7 fries, the number of fries was \( 27 + 7 = 34 \) fries.
- Before Dave ate his 14 fries, the number of fries was \( 34 + 14 = 48 \) fries.

Thus, the initial number of french fries in the pack was \( \boxed{48} \)."
"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes on a typical week:

- **Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:**
  - He has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
  - Total hours for these days: \(3 \text{ classes} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours}\).

- **Tuesdays and Thursdays:**
  - He has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
  - Total hours for these days: \(2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours}\).

Now, let's add the hours from all the days in one week:
- Total hours per week: \(3 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 7 \text{ hours}\).

Next, we need to find out how many hours he spends in classes over the entire semester. There are 16 weeks in the semester:
- Total hours in one semester: \(7 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 112 \text{ hours}\).

Therefore, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[
\boxed{112}

"First, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good in inches:

- Rolls: \(300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches}\)
- Chocolate croissants: \(120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches}\)
- Baguettes: \(60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches}\) (since 1 foot = 12 inches, and each baguette is 2 feet long, so \(2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ inches}\))

Next, we sum these lengths to get the total length in inches:
\[1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches}\]

Now, we convert the total length from inches to feet:
\[3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 280 \text{ feet}\]

Therefore, if Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they will be 280 feet long."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we first calculate the monthly requirement for each type of ape and then double it for the 2-month period.

1. **Monkeys' Requirement:**
   - Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(200 \times 2 = 400\) bananas.

2. **Gorillas' Requirement:**
   - Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(400 \times 2 = 800\) bananas.

3. **Baboons' Requirement:**
   - Baboons need 100 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(100 \times 2 = 200\) bananas.

Next, we sum the total number of bananas needed for all the apes over the 2-month period:
\[400 \text{ (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas}.\]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Since the football field is 100 yards long, running back and forth once is \(100 \times 2 = 200\) yards. Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so the total distance Blake runs is:
\[ 200 \times 15 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is \(40 \times 2 = 80\) yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[ 80 \times 34 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we need to find out how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards. The difference in the distance they run is:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, the winner runs \(\boxed{280}\) yards farther than the loser."

\]

Therefore, Raphael spent a total of $34 on everything."
"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 tadpoles come out from under a lily pad, which doesn't change the total number of tadpoles he sees because they were already part of the 11. After that, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so Finn can no longer see those 2.

To find out how many tadpoles Finn can see now, we subtract the 2 hidden tadpoles from the initial count:

11 - 2 = 9

Finn can now see 9 tadpoles in the pond."
"On Monday, the tank has a depth of 17 feet.

On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday, so the depth is:
\[ 17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet} \]

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday, so the depth is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is:
\[ 16 \text{ feet} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin:
- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3

Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Next, let's calculate the number of fish caught by Locsin:
- Starfish: 5 fewer than Anakin = 10 - 5 = 5
- Sea horses: 3 fewer than Anakin = 6 - 3 = 3
- Clownfish: 2 more than Anakin = 3 + 2 = 5

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, let's find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
Total fish caught by both = 19 (Anakin) + 13 (Locsin) = 32

Therefore, the total number of fish they were able to catch is 32."
"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the original price and the rate of increase:**
   - Original price = $20
   - Increase rate = 20% of the original price every two months

2. **Calculate the price increase every two months:**
   - Increase every two months = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4

3. **Determine the number of two-month periods in 36 months:**
   - Number of two-month periods in 36 months = 36 / 2 = 18

4. **Calculate the total increase in price over 36 months:**
   - Total increase = 18 * $4 = $72

5. **Calculate the final price after 36 months:**
   - Final price = Original price + Total increase = $20 + $72 = $92

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is \(\boxed{92}\)."
"Given:
- 5 red cars
- 3 action figures
- 1 doll

We know:
- One red car costs $4.
- The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
- An action figure costs $5.

First, calculate the cost of the doll:
- Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5, the doll costs \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

Next, calculate the total cost of the red cars:
- Each red car costs $4, and there are 5 red cars, so the total cost for the red cars is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) dollars.

Now, calculate the total cost of the action figures:
- Each action figure costs $5, and there are 3 action figures, so the total cost for the action figures is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

Finally, add up the costs of all the toys:
- Cost of red cars: $20
- Cost of action figures: $15
- Cost of the doll: $15

Total cost of all toys:
\[20 + 15 + 15 = 50\]

The total value of all the toys is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the amount of money Jackie will lose by doing her taxes herself instead of hiring an accountant. She will lose $35 for each hour of freelance work she does not do. Since she will be doing 3 fewer hours of freelance work, the total loss in income is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \]

Next, we need to consider the cost of hiring the accountant, which is $90. To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of the accountant from the amount of money she would lose by doing her taxes herself:

\[ \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \]

Therefore, Jackie will have \(\boxed{15}\) dollars more if she hires the accountant."
"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she has chosen and subtract this from her budget.

First, let's list the costs of the items:
- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Next, we sum these costs:
\[ 1090 + 157 + 74 + 157 + 74 + 102 \]

Let's break it down step by step:
\[ 1090 + 157 = 1247 \]
\[ 1247 + 74 = 1321 \]
\[ 1321 + 157 = 1478 \]
\[ 1478 + 74 = 1552 \]
\[ 1552 + 102 = 1654 \]

The total cost of the items is €1654. However, Elvira's budget is only €1500. Since the total cost exceeds her budget, she will not have any money left for clothing. In fact, she will be short by:
\[ 1654 - 1500 = 154 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she will need for 15 Spanish flans.

Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs. Therefore, for 15 flans, the total number of eggs required is:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Sandra's neighbor gives her a basket of 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

First, simplify the second equation:
\[ S + 2 + B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:
\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

"Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. If Ethel has $8, then twice the money Ethel has is \(2 \times 8 = 16\). Adding $2 to this amount gives \(16 + 2 = 18\).

Therefore, Jimmy has $18."
"Pancho walks 20 miles each day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, the miles he walks from Monday to Friday is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles each day. So, the miles he walks on the weekend is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the miles from the weekdays and the weekend, the total miles he walks in a week is:
\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week is:
\[ 120 \text{ miles} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of each item:

1. The hat costs $25.
2. The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
3. The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. The average is calculated as \(\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50\) dollars.

Now, we add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:
\[25 + 75 + 50 = 150\]

So, the total cost of each uniform is \(\boxed{150}\)."

2. **Sally Four's Age**: Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. **Granny Red's Age**: Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. Therefore, Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. **Sally Two's Age**: Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Therefore, Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we need to find the total age of the four birds:

- Sally Two: 19 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years

Adding these together:

\[ 19 + 8 + 16 + 8 = 41 \]

The total age of the four birds is 41 years."
"First, let's calculate the total minimum monthly payment Jessica needs to make on all her debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. So, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum monthly payment and add it to the total minimum monthly payment:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

Therefore, the total monthly payment Jessica will make is:

$1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:

$1500 * 12 = $18000

So, Jessica pays $18000 in a year."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel all the potatoes. Since it takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel each potato and he has 60 potatoes, the total time to peel all the potatoes is:

\[ 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut all the potatoes. Since it takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut each potato, the total time to cut all the potatoes is:

\[ 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 300 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the cutting time into minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):

\[ 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to peel the potatoes and the time it takes to cut the potatoes:

\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"First, let's determine the total revenue and the total cost to find the profit.

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They made $25 in profit.
   - Let \( C \) be the total cost.
   - Profit = Revenue - Cost
   - Therefore, \( 25 = \text{Revenue} - C \)
   - Rearrange to find Revenue: \( \text{Revenue} = C + 25 \)

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The cost per gallon is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, so the total cost per gallon is \( 3 + 2 = 5 \) dollars.
   - Let \( G \) be the number of gallons they made.
   - Total cost \( C = 5G \).

3. **Calculate the total revenue in terms of glasses:**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon.
   - Total revenue = \( 0.50 \times \text{Total glasses} \)
   - Total glasses = \( 20G \)
   - Therefore, Total revenue = \( 0.50 \times 20G = 10G \)

4. **Set up the equation for profit:**
   - From the profit equation: \( 25 = 10G - 5G \)
   - Simplify: \( 25 = 5G \)
   - Solve for \( G \): \( G = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) gallons

5. **Calculate the total cost of lemons:**
   - The cost of lemons per gallon is $3.
   - Total cost of lemons = \( 3G = 3 \times 5 = 15 \) dollars

Therefore, the total amount spent on lemons is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of Chinese participants in the race. We know there are 240 Asians in total and 80 of them are Japanese. Therefore, the number of Chinese participants is:

\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

Next, we know that out of these 160 Chinese participants, 60 are boys. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent and car fuel.

1. **Rent**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car fuel**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we calculate the remaining amount after these expenses.
\[
\text{Remaining amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
\]

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
\[
\text{Donation to charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
\]

After the donation, the remaining amount is:
\[
\text{Remaining amount after donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
\]

Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars.
\[
\text{Total given to daughter and wife} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we calculate the remaining amount after all these expenses and donations.
\[
\text{Final remaining amount} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{350}

"First, let's determine the number of crabs each person has:

1. Bo has 40 crabs.
2. Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. Therefore, Monic has:
   \[
   40 - 4 = 36 \text{ crabs}
   \]
3. Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. Therefore, Rani has:
   \[
   36 + 10 = 46 \text{ crabs}
   \]

Now, we add the number of crabs each person has to find the total number of crabs:
\[
40 + 36 + 46 = 122
\]

The total number of crabs the three have together is:
\[
\boxed{122}

"Lloyd earns $10 per hour for tutoring. 

For the first week, he tutored for 5 hours, so he earned:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

For the second week, he tutored for 8 hours, so he earned:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 80 \, \text{dollars} \]

Adding the earnings from both weeks:
\[ 50 \, \text{dollars} + 80 \, \text{dollars} = 130 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, Lloyd earned a total of $130 for the first two weeks."
"The winner got \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the votes. Given that the total number of students who voted was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Therefore, the number of votes the loser got is 20."
"Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( W \).

According to the problem, the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations. Therefore, we can write:
\[ 200 = 5W \]

Solving for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Therefore, the number of red roses ordered is:
\[ 4W = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Thus, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"First, let's determine Mark's age two years ago. We know that Jan is currently 30 years old. Two years ago, Jan was:

\[ 30 - 2 = 28 \]

According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. So, we calculate half of Jan's age two years ago:

\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

Then, we add 5 years to this value to find Mark's age two years ago:

\[ 14 + 5 = 19 \]

This means that two years ago, Mark was 19 years old. Therefore, Mark's current age is:

\[ 19 + 2 = 21 \]

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we add 2 years to Mark's current age to find Jean's age:

\[ 21 + 2 = 23 \]

So, Jean is 23 years old.

\[ \boxed{23} \]"
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay.

**Faster Team:**
Each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time for the faster team:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds} \times 4 = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

**Slower Team:**
The first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds.
The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run in:
\[ 60 - 3 = 57 \text{ seconds} \]
The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second runner, so they run in:
\[ 57 - 3 = 54 \text{ seconds} \]
The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third runner, so they run in:
\[ 54 - 3 = 51 \text{ seconds} \]
Total time for the slower team:
\[ 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

**Difference in Time:**
The difference in time between the two teams is:
\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

The faster team will win by \(\boxed{2}\) seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The difference in probability is:
\[ 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.25 \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, it is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

### Final Answer

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = \(10 \times 5 = 50\) pieces.

2. **Determine the total number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits:**
   - There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.
   - Total straw for rabbits = 20 pieces.

3. **Calculate the total number of pieces of straw used for the small rodents:**
   - Total straw for small rodents = 160 pieces.

4. **Calculate the number of pieces of straw used for the rats:**
   - Total straw for small rodents = straw for hamsters + straw for rabbits + straw for rats.
   - Therefore, straw for rats = 160 - 50 - 20 = 90 pieces.

5. **Determine the number of rats and the straw each rat gets:**
   - Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
   - Let the number of rats in each cage be \(x\).
   - Since there are 3 cages, the total number of rats = \(3x\).
   - Total straw for rats = \(3x \times 6 = 18x\).
   - We know that \(18x = 90\).
   - Solving for \(x\), we get \(x = \frac{90}{18} = 5\).

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the compounded interest over these months.

1. **Initial Amount**: $100
2. **Monthly Interest Rate**: 2% or 0.02

The formula for the amount after each month with compound interest is:
\[ A = P (1 + r)^n \]
where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate.
- \( n \) is the number of months the money is invested or borrowed for.

For 3 months, the calculation is:
\[ A = 100 \times (1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 \times (1.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 \]
\[ A = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the amount Mandy should give to Benedict is $106.12.

**Final Answer**: $106.12"
"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat the trader bought and sold as \( x \).

1. **Cost of buying the wheat:**
   - The cost per bag is $20.
   - Therefore, the total cost for \( x \) bags is \( 20x \).

2. **Cost of transporting the wheat:**
   - The transportation cost per bag is $2.
   - Therefore, the total transportation cost for \( x \) bags is \( 2x \).

3. **Total cost:**
   - The total cost for the trader is the sum of the cost of buying and the transportation cost.
   - Total cost = \( 20x + 2x = 22x \).

4. **Revenue from selling the wheat:**
   - The selling price per bag is $30.
   - Therefore, the total revenue for \( x \) bags is \( 30x \).

5. **Profit:**
   - The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Given that the profit is $400, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     30x - 22x = 400
     \]
   - Simplifying the equation:
     \[
     8x = 400
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{400}{8} = 50
     \]

Therefore, the trader sold \(\boxed{50}\) bags of wheat."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The tickets cost $20.25 in total. The food cost $4.50 less than the tickets, so the food cost is:
\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the rides. Each ride costs $33, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is:
\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:
\[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year, so the net increase is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees per year.
3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the net increase in trees is \(8 \times 10 = 80\) trees. Adding this to the initial number of trees, we get \(50 + 80 = 130\) trees.
4. **Trees that die**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, the number of trees that die is \(0.30 \times 130 = 39\) trees.
5. **Final number of trees**: Subtracting the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years, we get \(130 - 39 = 91\) trees.

So, the final number of trees Tom has left is \(\boxed{91}\)."

"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher and he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits:

\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher A} \]
\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher B} \]

Next, we calculate the payment from Publisher A. Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, Mark earns:

\[ 500 \times 5 = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ cents per sentence} \]

For 500 sentences from Publisher B, Mark earns:

\[ 500 \times 10 = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the earnings from both publishers, Mark's total weekly earnings are:

"To determine the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total score needed for an average of 93 over 6 tests:**
   \[
   \text{Total score needed} = 93 \times 6 = 558
   \]

2. **Sum the scores of the first five tests:**
   \[
   89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438
   \]

3. **Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test. The total score after removing the lowest score (which is 71) should be 558:**
   \[
   438 + x - 71 = 558
   \]

4. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   367 + x = 558
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = 558 - 367 = 191
   \]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score \(\boxed{191}\) on her sixth test to get an average of 93."
"To find the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the distance for each period separately and then sum them up.

1. **First Period:**
   - He rode 5 times a week.
   - Each ride was 25 kilometers.
   - He did this for 4 weeks.

   The total distance for the first period is:
   \[
   5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km}
   \]

2. **Second Period:**
   - He rode 2 times a week.
   - Each ride was 60 kilometers.
   - He did this for 3 weeks.

   The total distance for the second period is:
   \[
   2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ km/ride} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km}
   \]

3. **Total Distance:**
   - Sum of the distances from both periods:
   \[
   500 \text{ km} + 360 \text{ km} = 860 \text{ km}
   \]

Therefore, the total kilometers Micheal did is:
\[
\boxed{860}

"First, we need to determine the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can calculate the weight of each candied apple as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40 \text{g}}{2} = 20 \text{g} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars. There are 25 chocolate bars, each weighing 40g:

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{g} = 1000 \text{g} \]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples. There are 80 candied apples, each weighing 20g:

\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{g} = 1600 \text{g} \]

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000 \text{g} + 1600 \text{g} = 2600 \text{g} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is:

"On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

To find the total number of cakes she bought over the three days, we add the number of cakes from each day:

\[4 + 12 + 60 = 76\]

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. The cost of half a dozen plates is $6000.
2. The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.

First, calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:
\[ \text{Cost of half a dozen plates} = \$6000 \]

Next, determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:
\[ \text{Cost of twenty dozen cups} = \$6000 - \$1200 = \$4800 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of one dozen cups:
\[ \text{Cost of one dozen cups} = \frac{\$4800}{20} = \$240 \]

Finally, the cost of one cup is:
\[ \text{Cost of one cup} = \frac{\$240}{12} = \$20 \]

Therefore, the total cost of buying each cup is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so her total earnings from babysitting are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from mowing the lawn:
- Let \(x\) be the number of times Sara mows the lawn.
- She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, so her total earnings from mowing the lawn are \(4x\) dollars.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the total amount of money Sara has before she mows the lawn is \(10 + 20 + 4x = 30 + 4x\) dollars.

To find out how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we set up the equation:
\[30 + 4x = 70\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[4x = 70 - 30\]
\[4x = 40\]
\[x = \frac{40}{4}\]
\[x = 10\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \(t\) it takes to walk a certain distance \(d\) at a constant speed \(v\) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Here, the distance \(d\) is 15 miles and the speed \(v\) is 3 miles per hour. Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ t = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we need to subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total.

So, the number of customers on the third day is \(500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\).

Therefore, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 250."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons, and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool now has \( S = 8 \) gallons of water.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the shoes and the belt. The shoes cost $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00. Adding these together gives:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Her hourly wage is $8.00. To find the number of hours, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She is paying $165 each month for 12 months.

The total amount paid is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Finally, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned.

The remaining balance is:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by then is:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"

"First, let's determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's current age is given as 21 years.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's current age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years.
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years.

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\) years.
- Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\) years.
- Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\) years.

Now, we find the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

The average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is \(\boxed{45}\)."

"First, let's determine the total number of cards James has after the changes:

- Initially, James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards.
- After losing 8 water type cards, he has \(40 - 8 = 32\) water type cards.
- After buying 14 more grass type cards, he has \(20 + 14 = 34\) grass type cards.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards:
\[ 30 \text{ (fire type)} + 34 \text{ (grass type)} + 32 \text{ (water type)} = 96 \text{ cards} \]

Next, we need to find the probability that a randomly picked card is a water type card. The probability is given by the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To convert this probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 100 = 33.3333\ldots \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, we get:
\[ 33 \]

So, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is:

"First, let's determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces.

Kalinda's rate is 4 pieces per minute.

Her mom's rate is half of Kalinda's rate, so:
\[ \text{Mom's rate} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Next, we calculate their combined rate:
\[ \text{Combined rate} = \text{Kalinda's rate} + \text{Mom's rate} = 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the 360-piece puzzle:
\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{\text{Total pieces}}{\text{Combined rate}} = \frac{360}{6} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the time from minutes to hours:
\[ \text{Time in hours} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike is still corresponding with. Initially, he had 5 pen pals and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. Therefore, he is now corresponding with:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals} \]

Each pen pal sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, the total number of pages Mike receives from each pen pal per week is:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} \]

Since he is corresponding with 3 pen pals, the total number of pages he receives from all pen pals per week is:

\[ 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} \times 3 \text{ pen pals} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds in kind, so he also writes 30 pages a week. Therefore, the total number of pages he writes per week is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages} \]

Given that Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing per week is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the number of hours Mike spends writing a week is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason uses for his 15-minute calls with his boss each day. Since there are 30 days in the month, the total minutes spent on these calls is:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes he used for other calls:

\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the monthly plan of 1000 minutes:

\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Jason has \(\boxed{250}\) minutes left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of fries Griffin had:** 24
2. **Kyle took 5 fries:** 
   - Fries left with Griffin: \(24 - 5 = 19\)
3. **Billy took twice as many as Kyle:** 
   - Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries
   - Fries left with Griffin: \(19 - 10 = 9\)
4. **Ginger gave Griffin a handful of fries:** Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave as \(x\).
   - Fries with Griffin after Ginger gave: \(9 + x\)
5. **Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken:** 
   - Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries
   - Fries left with Griffin: \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\)
6. **In the end, Griffin had 27 fries:**
   - Therefore, \(7 + x = 27\)

Now, solve for \(x\):
\[7 + x = 27\]
\[x = 27 - 7\]
\[x = 20\]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

The total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2F \).

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

According to the problem, this difference is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]

To find \( F \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, the number of fish in each aquarium is \( 7 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works per week:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of hours for the entire 5 weeks:

\[ 24 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost before the discount is:

\[ 120 \text{ hours} \times \$250/\text{hour} = \$30,000 \]

Since Jean gets a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $30,000 and subtract it from the total cost:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$30,000 = 0.10 \times \$30,000 = \$3,000 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:

\[ \$30,000 - \$3,000 = \$27,000 \]

Therefore, Jean paid:

\[ \boxed{27000} \]"

Adding these amounts together:

\[ 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 96 \]

The total cost is $96. Isabelle split this cost evenly with her two parents, so the cost is divided into 3 equal parts:

\[ \frac{96}{3} = 32 \]

Each person paid \(\boxed{32}\) dollars."
"The chef bought 4 bags of onions, with each bag weighing 50 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of onions is:

\[ 4 \text{ bags} \times 50 \text{ pounds/bag} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Since the cost of onions is $1.50 per pound, the total cost is:

\[ 200 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.50/\text{pound} = \$300 \]

So, the chef spent \(\boxed{300}\)."
"First, let's determine how many cookies Sue and her sister ate each day.

**Monday:**
- Sue's sister ate 5 cookies.
- Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

**Tuesday:**
- Sue's sister ate 13 cookies.
- Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

**Total cookies:**
- Sue's sister: \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies.
- Sue: \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.

Now, we calculate the total calories consumed by each of them. Since each cookie has 200 calories:

**Total calories:**
- Sue's sister: \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.
- Sue: \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister:

\[9200 - 3600 = 5600\]

So, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."
"To determine the number of boys in the third class, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of students in the school:**
   - Each class has 20 students.
   - There are 3 classes.
   \[
   \text{Total number of students} = 20 \times 3 = 60
   \]

2. **Determine the number of boys and girls in the school:**
   - The school is 50% boys and 50% girls.
   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = \frac{50}{100} \times 60 = 30
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = \frac{50}{100} \times 60 = 30
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of girls in the first and second classes:**
   - The first class has 15 girls.
   - The second class has 12 girls.
   \[
   \text{Total number of girls in the first and second classes} = 15 + 12 = 27
   \]

4. **Determine the number of girls in the third class:**
   - The total number of girls in the school is 30.
   \[
   \text{Number of girls in the third class} = 30 - 27 = 3

"Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let the number of cougars killed today be \( x \). Therefore, the number of wolves killed today is \( 3x \).

We also know that today Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night. So, \( x = 15 - 3 = 12 \).

Thus, today Rick killed \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) wolves and 12 cougars.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals killed over the two days:
- Wolves: \( 10 + 36 = 46 \)
- Cougars: \( 15 + 12 = 27 \)

Total animals killed: \( 46 + 27 = 73 \).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many times Anne went down the water slide. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. Mitchel went down the slide 30 times.

To find 30% of Mitchel's times:
\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide 30 times minus 9 times:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Next, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. Since Anne went down the slide 21 times:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{84} \]"
"Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each. This means there are a total of \(10 \times 20 = 200\) cows.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, each stall gets \(40 \div 20 = 2\) new cows.

After adding the new cows, each stall now has \(20 + 2 = 22\) cows.

We need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each of the 20 stalls now has 22 cows, 8 stalls will have \(8 \times 22 = 176\) cows.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
176

Therefore, Brady has $45.00 in his piggy bank."
"First, calculate the total number of 10-foot sections in the 200-foot tall redwood:

\[
\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections}
\]

Next, determine the weight of the entire redwood before the termites ate any part of it:

\[
20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Since termites ate 30% of the redwood, calculate the remaining percentage of the redwood:

\[
100\% - 30\% = 70\%
\]

Now, calculate the weight of the remaining 70% of the redwood:

\[
8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the final weight of the redwood after the termites ate 30% of it is:

\[

"Given that Andrea has 52 apples, we can start by determining how many apples Jamal has. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Andrea's apples} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]

Substituting the number of apples Andrea has:

\[ 52 = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]

Solving for Jamal's apples:

\[ \text{Jamal's apples} = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

Next, we need to find out how many bananas Jamal has. According to the problem, Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples:

\[ \text{Jamal's bananas} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal:

\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{\text{Jamal's bananas}}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits. First, we sum up the fruits for each person:

- Andrea's total fruits: \(52 \text{ apples} + 24 \text{ bananas} = 76\)
- Jamal's total fruits: \(44 \text{ apples} + 48 \text{ bananas} = 92\)

Adding these together gives the total number of fruits:

\[ 76 + 92 = 168 \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits is:

\[ \boxed{168} \]"
"To determine how many cups of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making over the two days and then find out how much flour is required for that number of cookies.

1. Calculate the total number of cookies:
   - Today: 36 cookies
   - Tomorrow: 30 cookies
   - Total: \(36 + 30 = 66\) cookies

2. Determine the amount of flour needed for 66 cookies:
   - 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies.
   - Therefore, the amount of flour needed per cookie is \(\frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ cups per cookie}\).

3. Calculate the total amount of flour needed for 66 cookies:
   - Total flour = \(66 \text{ cookies} \times \frac{1}{6} \text{ cups per cookie} = 11 \text{ cups}\).

So, Carla will need \(\boxed{11}\) cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"First, we need to determine how many pennies are in two-thirds of the cup. The total number of pennies in the cup is 9,300.

To find two-thirds of 9,300, we calculate:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200
\]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in two-thirds of the cup.

Since 100 pennies make up $1.00, we convert 6,200 pennies to dollars by dividing by 100:
\[
\frac{6200}{100} = 62
\]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two-thirds of the pennies in the cup is:
\[
\boxed{62}

"First, let's determine the number of trees Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, and Chris has 6 trees, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the number of trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. So, we first find twice the number of trees Ferdinand has:

\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Then, we add 5 to this number:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \]

So, Harry has 11 trees. Now, we need to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand. We subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:

\[ 11 - 3 = 8 \]

Therefore, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Carmen has $100.

Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has:
\[ 100 + 25 = 125 \]

Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has:
\[ 125 + 50 = 175 \]

To find out how much all three girls have combined, we add their amounts together:
\[ 100 + 125 + 175 = 400 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money all three girls have combined is:
\[ 400 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

1. **Brokerage Fee Calculation:**
   - Brokerage fee = 5% of $350,000
   - Brokerage fee = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500

2. **Transfer Fee Calculation:**
   - Transfer fee = 12% of $350,000
   - Transfer fee = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

3. **Total Price Calculation:**
   - Total price = Selling price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
   - Total price = $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500

4. **Comparison with Budget:**
   - Mrs. Cruz's budget = $400,000
   - Difference = Total price - Mrs. Cruz's budget
   - Difference = $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"First, let's calculate the transfer fees and the brokerage fee.

1. **Transfer Fees**: 3% of $400,000
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000
   \]

2. **Brokerage Fee**: 5% of $400,000
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000
   \]

Next, we add the transfer fees and the brokerage fee to find the total fees paid:
\[
\text{Total Fees} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000
\]

Now, we subtract the total fees and the remaining loan amount from the selling price to find Mr. Tan's net proceeds:
\[
\text{Net Proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000
\]

Therefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are:

"First, let's break down the time taken for each step:

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:** This takes 20 minutes.

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:** It takes 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees. 
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:** This takes 5 minutes less than the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - So, the cooking time is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

Now, we add up all the times:
- Time to heat to 300 degrees: 20 minutes
- Time to heat to 400 degrees: 28 minutes
- Time to cook the chicken: 23 minutes

Total time = \(20 + 28 + 23 = 71\) minutes.

"To find out how much the real estate agent spent on all the ads, we need to calculate the total cost for the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the newspaper ads:
- The cost per newspaper ad is $5.
- The number of newspaper ads bought is 50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the newspaper ads is \(5 \times 50 = 250\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the television ads:
- The cost per television ad is $75.
- The number of television ads bought is 15.
- Therefore, the total cost for the television ads is \(75 \times 15 = 1125\) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs of the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of newspaper ads + Cost of television ads
- Total cost = \(250 + 1125 = 1375\) dollars.

Therefore, the real estate agent spent a total of \(1375\) dollars on buying all the ads."
"The juggler can juggle 16 balls in total. Half of these balls are golf balls, so there are \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) golf balls. Half of these golf balls are blue, so there are \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) blue golf balls.

\[ 300 + 312 + 150 = 762 \]

So, Mary got a total of 762 M&Ms."
"First, let's calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms of both houses. Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is:

\[ 3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows per bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows} \]

Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of both houses is:

\[ 6 \text{ windows per house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 12 \text{ windows} \]

Next, we need to account for the additional windows in each house. There are 4 additional windows in each house, and since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is:

\[ 4 \text{ windows per house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 8 \text{ windows} \]

Now, we add the windows from the bedrooms and the additional windows to get the total number of windows:

\[ 12 \text{ windows from bedrooms} + 8 \text{ additional windows} = 20 \text{ windows} \]

Therefore, the total number of windows between the houses is:

"First, let's calculate the number of stitches for the collar. Since the collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches that the body of the sweater takes, we have:

\[ \text{Stitches for the collar} = \frac{900}{10} = 90 \]

Next, we calculate the number of stitches for the rosette. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so:

\[ \text{Stitches for the rosette} = 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We can find the total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette by adding the stitches for these parts together:

\[ \text{Total stitches for body, collar, and rosette} = 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \]

The remaining stitches are for the two sleeves. To find the number of stitches for each sleeve, we subtract the total stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches in the sweater:

\[ \text{Stitches for the two sleeves} = 1800 - 1170 = 630 \]

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2:

\[ \text{Stitches for each sleeve} = \frac{630}{2} = 315 \]

Therefore, each sleeve takes 315 stitches."
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds:
- Number of tomato seed packets: 20
- Cost per packet of tomato seeds: $40
- Total cost for tomato seeds = 20 packets * $40/packet = $800

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the celery seeds:
- Number of celery seed packets: 80
- Cost per packet of celery seeds: $30
- Total cost for celery seeds = 80 packets * $30/packet = $2400

Now, we add the total costs for both types of seeds:
- Total cost for tomato seeds: $800
- Total cost for celery seeds: $2400
- Total cost for all seeds = $800 + $2400 = $3200

Therefore, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is $3200."
"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each part and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   - Therefore, the first scene has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, Sean's lines in the first scene are \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\).

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
   - Therefore, the second scene has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, Sean's lines in the second scene are \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\).

4. **Total Lines:**
   - Summing up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
   - Solo song: 54 lines
   - First scene: 36 lines
   - Second scene: 48 lines
   - Total lines = \(54 + 36 + 48 = 138\)

Therefore, Sean has to memorize a total of 138 lines."
"First, let's determine how many cards had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32
\]

So, 32 cards had the letter A. This leaves us with:

\[
80 - 32 = 48

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 48 cards had the letter B. Since 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
\]

So, 24 cards had the letter B. This leaves us with:

\[
48 - 24 = 24
\]

Now, we need to find out how many of the remaining 24 cards had the letter C. Since 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C, we calculate:

\[
\frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15
\]

So, 15 cards had the letter C. This leaves us with:

\[
24 - 15 = 9
\]

Therefore, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is:

\[
\boxed{9}
\]"
"First, calculate the total time Matthew spends digging the small holes:
- Time for one small hole = 3 minutes
- Total time for 30 small holes = 30 * 3 = 90 minutes

Next, calculate the total time Matthew spends digging the large holes:
- Time for one large hole = 10 minutes
- Total time for 15 large holes = 15 * 10 = 150 minutes

Now, add the total time for both small and large holes:
- Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

Convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- Total time in hours = 240 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 4 hours

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes."
"The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 20 + 20 = 40.

40"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

Sam is currently 6 years old."
"To find out how much Peter paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the popsicles:
- Peter purchased 20 popsicles.
- Each popsicle costs $0.25.
- Therefore, the total cost for the popsicles is \( 20 \times 0.25 = 5 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars:
- Peter purchased 4 ice cream bars.
- Each ice cream bar costs $0.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the ice cream bars is \( 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:
- Total cost = Cost of popsicles + Cost of ice cream bars
- Total cost = \( 5 + 2 = 7 \) dollars.

Therefore, Peter paid a total of 7 dollars."
"First, determine the number of spots on a mamba. Since a cobra has 70 spots and has twice as many spots as a mamba, a mamba has:

\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \text{ spots} \]

Next, calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \text{ spots} \]

Then, calculate the total number of spots for all the mambas. There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \text{ spots} \]

Now, find the combined total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \text{ spots} \]

Finally, find half of the combined total number of spots:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2450 \]"

- Each team member brings 2 guests, so that's \(12 \times 2 = 24\) guests.
- Including the 3 coaches, the total number of people is \(12 + 24 + 3 = 39\).

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3:

\[
\frac{39}{3} = 13 \text{ pizzas}
\]

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pizza costs $15, so:

\[
13 \times 15 = 195
\]

Therefore, Maddy will spend \(\boxed{195}\) dollars."

"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. 

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we add the stories from both weeks:
- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Adding these together gives:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents.

Kelly has 5 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the total value of the quarters is:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly also has 2 dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, the total value of the dimes is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the value of the quarters and dimes together gives:
\[ 125 + 20 = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how many cents she has left, we subtract the cost of the pop from her total amount of money:
\[ 145 - 55 = 90 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 90 \text{ cents} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of stars in the 76-star flag from the given rows:

- Three rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars
- Two rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars

Adding these together gives the total number of stars from the specified rows:
\[24 + 12 = 36\]

The total number of stars on the flag is 76. Subtracting the stars accounted for from the total gives the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
\[76 - 36 = 40\]

Now, to find the number of 5-star rows, we divide the remaining stars by 5:
\[40 \div 5 = 8\]

So, the number of rows of 5 stars is:
\[

"First, calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight is:

\[ 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, determine how many trucks are needed to carry 6000 pounds, given that each truck can carry 2000 pounds. This is calculated by dividing the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks} \]

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip."
"First, let's determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed:

\[ \text{Speed of the slow lane car} = \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover 480 miles. We use the formula for time, which is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ \boxed{16 \text{ hours}} \]"
"First, let's determine how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, Izzy has:

\[ 22 - 5 = 17 \text{ medals} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ 22 + 17 = 39 \text{ medals} \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

\[ \boxed{390} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ bars per packet} = 40 \text{ bars} \]

Next, we determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get in total:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ bars per adult} = 24 \text{ bars} \]

Subtract the number of bars the adults get from the total number of bars to find out how many bars are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ bars} - 24 \text{ bars} = 16 \text{ bars} \]

Now, we need to divide these 16 bars equally among the 8 children:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ bars per child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"First, let's determine the total time Susan works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she takes a half-hour break, so the actual working time is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we convert the working time from hours to minutes:

\[ 2.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Susan earns $5 for every 10 minutes of work. To find out how much she earns in 150 minutes, we first determine how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

\[ \frac{150 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 15 \text{ intervals} \]

Since she earns $5 for each interval, her total earnings are:

\[ 15 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/interval} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's determine the points each player has after the first three rounds:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we check if each player has over 20 points to see if they get an extra point in the fourth round:

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point, keeping his total at 18 points.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Now, we sum up the points of all three players after the extra points have been distributed:

- Mike: 22 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 43 points

The total points are \(22 + 18 + 43 = 83\).

Therefore, the total points of all three players after the extra points are distributed is \(\boxed{83}\)."

The oldest son will wash 8 oranges, and the youngest son will wash 4 oranges. Together, they will wash \(8 + 4 = 12\) oranges.

Will bought 15 oranges initially. After the sons wash 12 oranges, the number of unwashed oranges is \(15 - 12 = 3\).

Therefore, the number of oranges left unwashed is 3."
"On the first day, Darren does:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, he does:
- \(100 + 20 = 120\) pushups
- \(50 - 10 = 40\) squats
- \(20 \times 2 = 40\) dumbbell presses

Now, let's calculate the total for each activity over the two days:
- Total pushups: \(100 + 120 = 220\)
- Total squats: \(50 + 40 = 90\)
- Total dumbbell presses: \(20 + 40 = 60\)

Adding these together gives the total count of activities:

The total count of the activities he's done in the two days is \(\boxed{370}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. There are 5 members in the household, and they eat rice at both lunch and dinner.

So, the total rice consumption per meal (either lunch or dinner) is:
\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/person} = 1 \text{ kg/meal} \]

Since they eat rice at both lunch and dinner, the total daily consumption is:
\[ 1 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{2 \text{ kg/day}} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Finally, to find out how many weeks the rice will last, we divide the number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
\[ \frac{21 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and compare it to his target of 120 crates.

1. Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he only had 5 days to sell bread.
2. Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates.
3. On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
4. On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
5. On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

First, we sum the crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 = 45 \]

Next, we add the crates sold over the weekend:
\[ 45 + 20 = 65 \]

Now, we compare the total crates sold to the target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

So, Sam was off by 55 crates from his target for the week.

"To determine the total cost of the antique desk for Carmen, we need to calculate the sequence of bids and sum them up.

1. **Initial Bid**: Carmen starts with the opening bid of $200.
2. **First Other Bidder**: The first other bidder bids $250 (since the bids rise by $50 each time).
3. **Carmen's First Bid**: Carmen bids $300.
4. **Second Other Bidder**: The second other bidder bids $350.
5. **Carmen's Second Bid**: Carmen bids $400.
6. **Third Other Bidder**: The third other bidder bids $450.
7. **Carmen's Final Bid**: Carmen bids $500 and wins the auction.

Now, we sum up all the bids Carmen made:
- First bid: $200
- Second bid: $300
- Third bid: $400
- Fourth bid: $500

Adding these together:
\[ 200 + 300 + 400 + 500 = 1400 \]

Thus, the total cost of the desk for Carmen is \(\boxed{1400}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total distance John travels each day. Since his work is 30 miles away and he has to go there and back, he travels \(30 \times 2 = 60\) miles each day.

Next, we calculate the total distance he travels in a week. Since he goes to work 5 days a week, the total distance for a week is \(60 \times 5 = 300\) miles.

Now, we calculate the total distance he travels in a year. Since he works 50 weeks a year, the total distance for a year is \(300 \times 50 = 15000\) miles.

The cost per mile is $2, so the total cost for the miles driven in a year is \(15000 \times 2 = 30000\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total bonus he gives his driver. Since he gives a $150 bonus per month and there are 50 weeks in a year, he works 10 months in a year (assuming he doesn't work in the 10 weeks of unpaid leave). Therefore, the total bonus for the year is \(150 \times 10 = 1500\) dollars.

Finally, we add the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus to find the total amount he pays a year for driving. The total amount is \(30000 + 1500 = 31500\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{31500}

"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of books sold in the first year:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of books sold in the current year.
   - According to the problem, \( x = 45 \).
   - The number of books sold in the first year is twice the number sold in the current year, so it is \( 2x = 2 \times 45 = 90 \).

2. **Determine the total number of books sold over the three years:**
   - The total number of books initially is 250.
   - There are currently 50 unsold books.
   - Therefore, the total number of books sold is \( 250 - 50 = 200 \).

3. **Calculate the number of books sold in the second year:**
   - The total number of books sold is 200.
   - The number of books sold in the first year is 90.
   - The number of books sold in the current year is 45.
   - Thus, the number of books sold in the second year is \( 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 \).

4. **Calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year:**
   - Each book sells for $20.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money earned in the second year is \( 65 \times 20 = 1300 \).

"To determine the number of new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many extra arms and legs they will grow based on the given intervals.

1. **Extra Arms:**
   - The serum causes an extra arm every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra arms is calculated by dividing 15 by 3.
   \[
   \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ extra arms}
   \]

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The serum causes an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra legs is calculated by dividing 15 by 5.
   \[
   \frac{15}{5} = 3 \text{ extra legs}
   \]

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs.
   \[
   5 \text{ extra arms} + 3 \text{ extra legs} = 8 \text{ new limbs}
   \]

Therefore, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow a total of 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since each business suit costs $100:
\[ 5 \times \$100 = \$500 \]
\[ \text{Flight ticket cost} = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

The total amount Theo wants to save is $2000. Therefore, the total amount he can spend on the trip is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

Now, let's sum up the costs of the business suits, suitcases, and flight ticket:
\[ \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$2050 \]

The remaining amount for buying gifts is:
\[ \$4000 - \$2050 = \$1950 \]

Therefore, Theo has to spend \(\boxed{1950}\) on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"First, let's break down the daily egg consumption:

- Three people eat 3 eggs each per day, so that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
- The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each per day, so that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.

Adding these together, the total daily egg consumption for the family is \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs.

Since they eat eggs every day, in a week (7 days), the total egg consumption will be \(13 \times 7 = 91\) eggs.

Therefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"If Quinn is 30 years old, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, then Jane is:

So, Trent is 32 years old."
"First, let's determine Noah's age six years ago. Since Cera is currently 46 years old, six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old. According to the problem, six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. Therefore, Noah's age six years ago was \(\frac{40}{2} = 20\) years old. This means Noah is currently \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

Next, we know that six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age at that time. Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. Therefore, the current population of Chile is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The population of Chile now is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness. According to the problem, 8 people couldn't come due to illness.

Then, we need to find out how many people had previous commitments. The problem states that 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. So, the number of people with previous commitments is:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2
\]

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is the sum of those due to illness and those with previous commitments:

\[
8 + 2 = 10
\]

Finally, to find out how many people actually showed up, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:

\[
24 - 10 = 14
\]

So, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of marbles Solomon received from his father. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, and his father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought. Therefore, the number of marbles his father gave him is:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store. Initially, the store had 50 marbles. Adding the 20 marbles Solomon bought and the 8 marbles his father gave him, the total number of marbles is:

\[
50 + 20 + 8 = 78
\]

Each marble weighs 2kgs. Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:

\[
78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kgs}
\]

Thus, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:

\[
\boxed{156}
\]"
"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Given that the classroom has 30 boys, we can use the information provided to find the number of girls and nongendered children.

1. **Number of girls**: Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, the number of girls is:
   \[
   3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

2. **Number of nongendered children**: The classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, so the number of nongendered children is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

3. **Total number of children**: To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
   \[
   30 + 90 + 3 = 123
   \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is:
\[
\boxed{123}

"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

1. Let the number of electric poles be \( P \) and the number of electric wires be \( W \).
2. According to the ratio, \( P:W = 1:3 \).
3. This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.
4. Given \( W = 45 \), we can set up the proportion: \( \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \).
5. Substituting \( W = 45 \) into the proportion, we get \( \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \).
6. Solving for \( P \), we multiply both sides by 45: \( P = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \).

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is \( 15 \)."
"Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women at the party, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, the number of people who left is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

This means 10 people left the party. We know that 22 men stayed at the party. Let's determine how many men left:
\[ 25 - 22 = 3 \]
So, 3 men left the party. Since 10 people in total left and 3 of them were men, the number of women who left is:
\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Initially, there were 15 women. After 7 women left, the number of women remaining is:
\[ 15 - 7 = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of women left at the party is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"The book costs $4. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, the magazine costs:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

A pen costs $1 less than a magazine, so the pen costs:

\[ 2 - 1 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Therefore, the pen costs $1."
"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. According to the problem, Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together give a total of 26 pencils. We can confirm this by noting that the 2 loose pencils plus the pencils in the three boxes equal 26 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many pencils are in the three boxes. Since the total number of pencils is 26 and there are 2 loose pencils, the number of pencils in the three boxes is:
\[ 26 - 2 = 24 \]

Now, we know that Jam has 26 pencils and Meg has 46 pencils. To find the total number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together, we add the number of pencils each has:
\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

To store all 72 pencils, we need to determine how many boxes are required. Since each box can hold the same number of pencils as the three boxes Jam has (which is 24 pencils per box), we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:
\[ 72 \div 24 = 3 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 3 boxes to store all their pencils. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to calculate the total weakening effect from the ice cubes and the cream added.

1. **Calculate the number of ice cubes used:**
   Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Shannon's coffee is cooled by 65 degrees.
   \[
   \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weakening effect from the ice cubes:**
   Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   \[
   \text{Weakening from ice cubes} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weakening effect from the cream:**
   Adding 15 milliliters of cream also weakens the coffee.
   \[
   \text{Weakening from cream} = 15 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weakening effect:**
   \[
   \text{Total weakening} = \text{Weakening from ice cubes} + \text{Weakening from cream} = 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."
"To determine how many old records the 5 people brought in, we need to understand the trade ratio and the outcome of the trades.

Given:
- The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record.
- 5 people leave with 7 new records.

First, calculate the total number of old records traded for the 7 new records:
\[ 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records per new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

Therefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior programmers. Given that the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, and the total number of employees is 100, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

\[
\text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers can be calculated as:

\[
\text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total monthly payment to all junior programmers is:

\[
\text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
\]

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:

\[
2000 + 400 = 2400 \text{ per month}
\]

Thus, the total monthly payment to all senior programmers is:

\[
\text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
\]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:

\[
\text{Total payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000
\]

\[
\boxed{224000}

"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

1. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).
2. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).
3. We know that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 6 = 20
   \]
4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 20 - 6 = 14
   \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( \boxed{14} \)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 lollipops on his way to school:
   \[
   24 - 2 = 22
   \]
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends:
   \[
   22 - 14 = 8
   \]
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends (which is 14):
   \[
   2 \times 14 = 28
   \]
   Adding these to the 8 lollipops he has left:
   \[
   8 + 28 = 36
   \]
5. He eats 3 more lollipops that night:
   \[
   36 - 3 = 33
   \]
6. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning:
   \[
   33 - 2 = 31
   \]

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is:
\[
\boxed{31}

"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

\[ \text{Rewards earned} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

On this shopping trip, the customer spent $43 and used their $4 rewards. Additionally, they applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the rewards are $4, the coupon took:

\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total discount applied:

\[ \text{Total discount} = 4 + 8 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the total discount from the amount spent:

\[ \text{Amount paid} = 43 - 12 = 31 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A:

1. **Annual Salary**: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
2. **Tax**: 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
3. **Net Pay**: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B:

1. **Annual Salary**: $42,000
2. **Property Tax**: $6,000
3. **Net Income After Property Tax**: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
4. **Tax on Net Income**: 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
5. **Net Pay**: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:

- **Job A Net Pay**: $24,000
- **Job B Net Pay**: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:

$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate."
"First, we calculate the number of ruined castles. Since 40 percent of the 220 castles are ruins, we find 40 percent of 220:

\[ 0.40 \times 220 = 88 \]

So, there are 88 ruined castles in Scotland.

Next, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. We know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned, so we calculate half of 88:

\[ \frac{88}{2} = 44 \]

Therefore, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is 44."

- Nick has 10 guns.
- Richard (RJ) has 1 gun.
- Richard (the other one) has 5 guns.

Adding these together:

\[ 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 \]

Next, we need to share these 24 guns equally among the 4 of them. To find out how many guns each person would get, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people:

\[ 24 \div 4 = 6 \]

So, if they share the guns equally, each of them would have 6 guns.

Each of them would have 6 guns."
"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, calculate the amount of sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers:
- Each batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar.
- Therefore, for 8 batches, the total sugar needed is \( 8 \times 30 = 240 \) ounces.

Next, calculate the amount of sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge:
- Each batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar.
- Therefore, for 1 batch, the total sugar needed is \( 1 \times 70 = 70 \) ounces.

Now, add the amounts of sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge:
- Total sugar needed = sugar for suckers + sugar for fudge
- Total sugar needed = 240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces.

Therefore, Mason needs a total of 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge."
"First, let's calculate the value of the shares after the first year. Maria initially buys 8 shares at $8 each.

Initial value of shares = 8 shares * $8/share = $64

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. So, the new price per share after the first year is:

New price per share = $8 * (1 + 50%) = $8 * 1.5 = $12

The value of the shares after the first year is:

Value after first year = 8 shares * $12/share = $96

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. So, the new price per share after the second year is:

New price per share = $12 * (1 - 25%) = $12 * 0.75 = $9

The value of the shares after the second year is:

Value after second year = 8 shares * $9/share = $72

Therefore, the final value of all Maria's shares is $72."

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group will then have \( x - 10 \) students.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation, we get:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The smallest group, therefore, has:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Thus, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the number of cows be \( C \).
2. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is \( 2C \).
3. The total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   C + 2C = 60
   \]
4. Simplifying the equation, we get:
   \[
   3C = 60
   \]
5. Solving for \( C \), we find:

"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad. Therefore, the blue beetle and the green toad each weigh 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake. Therefore, the yellow snake weighs \(50 + 10 = 60\) pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird. Therefore, the red bird weighs \(50 - 20 = 30\) pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself. The weights are as follows:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

\[ \text{Daily revenue from tractors} = 10 \, \text{tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily revenue from silos:

\[ \text{Daily revenue from silos} = 5 \, \text{silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find the increase in daily revenue:

\[ \text{Increase in daily revenue} = \$1100 - \$1000 = \$100 \]

To find the percentage increase, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Increase in daily revenue}}{\text{Original daily revenue}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to break down the costs for each item and then sum them up for a year.

1. **Food Cost:**
   - Food costs $25 per week.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost for food is \( 25 \times 4 = 100 \) dollars.
   - For a year, the cost for food is \( 100 \times 12 = 1200 \) dollars.

2. **Treats Cost:**
   - Treats cost $20 per month.
   - For a year, the cost for treats is \( 20 \times 12 = 240 \) dollars.

3. **Medicine Cost:**
   - Medicine costs $100 per month.
   - For a year, the cost for medicine is \( 100 \times 12 = 1200 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up all the yearly costs:
\[ 1200 \text{ (food)} + 240 \text{ (treats)} + 1200 \text{ (medicine)} = 2640 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Madeline spends \(\boxed{2640}\) dollars on her dog per year."
"To determine the total number of hours Peyton's after-work activities will take, we need to calculate the duration of each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Yoga Class on Monday:**
   - Duration: 1 hour

2. **Cooking Class on Tuesday:**
   - Duration: 3 times the yoga class
   - Calculation: \( 3 \times 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours} \)

3. **Cheese-Tasting Event on Wednesday:**
   - Duration: 0.5 hours (or 30 minutes)

4. **Museum Tour on Thursday:**
   - Duration: Half the duration of the cooking class
   - Calculation: \( \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \)

5. **Errands on Friday:**
   - Duration: 2 hours

Now, we sum up all the durations:

\[
1 \text{ hour} + 3 \text{ hours} + 0.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, the total number of hours Peyton's after-work activities will take is:

\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of plant pots needed for the roses. Since the school asked for twice as many plant pots for the roses as for the daisies, and they asked for 30 plant pots for the daisies, the number of plant pots needed for the roses is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we add the number of plant pots needed for the daisies and the roses to find the total number of plant pots required:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \]

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number of plant pots she bought:

\[ 100 - 90 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of plant pots April has left over is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine how much Andrea saved, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial amount of money Andrea had, which is $36.
2. Subtract the amount she spent on the sweater, which is $11.
3. Subtract the amount she gave to her brother, which is $4.

Let's perform the calculations:

\[ 36 - 11 - 4 = 21 \]

So, Andrea saved \(\boxed{21}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming. He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Next, he watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is:

\[ 3 \times 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on vacation. Then:

\[ 0.30T = 15 \text{ hours} \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ hours}}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:

\[ 0.40 \times 50 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time John spent sightseeing is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle earns from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works 20 hours, so:

\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money she earns from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works 15 hours, so:

\[ 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, let's add the money she already has in her savings to the money she earns from both jobs:

\[ 80 \, \text{dollars} + 200 \, \text{dollars} + 75 \, \text{dollars} = 355 \, \text{dollars} \]

The phone costs $400. To find out how much more money Annabelle needs to save, we subtract the total amount she has from the cost of the phone:

\[ 400 \, \text{dollars} - 355 \, \text{dollars} = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save \(\boxed{45}\) dollars."
"The height of the shortest tree is 6 feet.

The second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so its height is:
\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet} \]

The combined height of the shortest and the second tree is:
\[ 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet} \]

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree, so:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is:
\[ 34 \text{ feet} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the toy cars and teddy bears Dean bought.

The cost of 6 toy cars at $2 each is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of 5 teddy bears at $1 each is:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount spent:
\[ 12 + 5 = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Dean started with $28. After spending $17, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 28 - 17 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

His mother then gives him an extra $10, so the total amount of money Dean has now is:
\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost for Morgan and her friends to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. Then, we will subtract these costs from her budget to find out how much money is left for her friends.

1. **Cost of mini-golf for one person:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of mini-golf} = \$5
   \]

2. **Cost of go-karts for one person (2 rides):**
   \[
   \text{Cost of go-karts} = 2 \times \$10 = \$20
   \]

3. **Total cost for one person (including mini-golf and go-karts):**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for one person} = \$5 + \$20 = \$25
   \]

4. **Cost for Morgan herself:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for Morgan} = \$25
   \]

5. **Cost for arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for arcade tokens} = \$5
   \]

6. **Total cost for Morgan and arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for Morgan and arcade tokens} = \$25 + \$5 = \$30
   \]

7. **Remaining budget after accounting for Morgan and arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining budget} = \$90 - \$30 = \$60
   \]

8. **Cost for one friend (including mini-golf and go-karts):**
   \[
   \text{Cost for one friend} = \$25
   \]

9. **Number of friends Morgan can invite:**
   \[
   \text{Number of friends} = \frac{\$60}{\$25} = 2.4
   \]

Since Morgan cannot invite a fraction of a friend, she can invite 2 friends.

\[

"First, let's calculate how much money Marisa gets in total over 5 days from her parents. Since she gets $5 every day, over 5 days she gets:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she spends on lollipops each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops every day. Therefore, the cost of lollipops each day is:

\[ 4 \text{ lollipops/day} \times 25 \text{ cents/lollipop} = 100 \text{ cents/day} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, she spends $1 each day on lollipops. Over 5 days, the total amount spent on lollipops is:

\[ 1 \text{ dollar/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the total amount spent on lollipops from the total amount she received to find out how much she saves in her piggy bank:

\[ 25 \text{ dollars} - 5 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank after 5 days is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since gumballs cost $0.05 each and he bought 40 gumballs, the total cost for the gumballs is:
\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

This means that the amount of money Billy had left after buying the gumballs is:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the total change he had before buying the gumballs is:
\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

This means that the amount of money Billy spent on candy is:
\[ 10 - 16/2 = 10 - 8 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is:
\[ \frac{2}{1.5} = \frac{2 \times 2}{1.5 \times 2} = \frac{4}{3} \approx 1.33 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{4}{3}} \]"
"Let's denote Carver's age as \( C \) and his son's age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Carver just turned 45 years old, so \( C = 45 \).
2. Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age, which can be written as \( C = 2S - 5 \).

Substituting \( C = 45 \) into the second equation, we get:
\[ 45 = 2S - 5 \]

To find \( S \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2S \]
\[ 50 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ S = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles.
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles.
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: \(75 + 100 - 50 = 125\) miles.

So, the total distance for one trip is:
\[ 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance traveled is:
\[ 300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles/day} \]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily distance:
\[ \frac{18000}{900} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the train goes between services every 20 days."
"First, let's determine the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed. The collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

The Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing, and the chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing. The average is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:

\[
4 \text{ chihuahua beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per bed} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:

\[
3 \text{ collie beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per bed} = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the amounts of stuffing needed for the chihuahua and collie beds:

\[
8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is:

\[
\boxed{23}

   - Speed: 70 mph
   - Time: \(\frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours}\)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Distance: 240 miles
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Time: \(\frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours}\)

Adding the times for both segments:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time for the trip is \(\boxed{6}\) hours."
"To find out how many fourth-grade boys were at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of fourth-grade boys at the school.
2. Subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

First, we know the total number of fourth-graders is 96, and 43 of them are girls. Therefore, the number of boys is:
\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

On Friday, 4 fourth-grade boys were absent. So, the number of boys present on Friday is:
\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

Thus, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is:
\[ \boxed{49} \]"
"If there are 6 girls in the park and there are twice the number of boys, then there are \(6 \times 2 = 12\) boys in the park.

Therefore, the total number of kids in the park is 18."
"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass, we need to ensure the total points from all three tests sum to at least 42 points.

1. Jane's score on the first test: 15 points
2. Jane's score on the second test: 18 points

First, we calculate the total points from the first two tests:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Next, we need to find out how many more points are required to reach at least 42 points:
\[ 42 - 33 = 9 \]

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on her third test to pass.

The minimum number of points she must score on the third test is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of people kicked out for shoplifting. According to the problem, the number of shoplifters is four times the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks minus 5. Since 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, we can calculate the number of shoplifters as follows:

\[ 4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

Next, we need to find out how many people were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. The problem states that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we know the total number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence. Adding these together, we get:

\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

The total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is 50. To find out how many were kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the number of people kicked out for the three specific reasons from the total:

\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:

\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"First, let's determine how many points Erin has after scoring 14 points. According to the problem, after scoring these 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara, who has 8 points.

This means that before scoring the 14 points, Erin had:
\[ 24 - 14 = 10 \]

Therefore, Erin had \(\boxed{10}\) points before scoring the 14 points."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames for all seniors. Each picture frame costs $20, and there is an additional 20% cost for etching the logo.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   \[
   \text{Cost per frame} = \$20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 44 frames} = 44 \times \$20 = \$880
   \]

2. **Cost of etching the logo:**
   \[
   \text{Additional cost per frame} = 20\% \times \$20 = 0.20 \times \$20 = \$4
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total etching cost for 44 frames} = 44 \times \$4 = \$176
   \]

3. **Total cost for picture frames and etching:**
   \[

"To determine the total cost if Ethan made his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the savings from the DIY approach and subtract that from the original market price.

1. Calculate the savings from the DIY approach:
   - The savings is 20% of the original price.
   - Original price = $400.
   - Savings = 20% of $400 = 0.20 * $400 = $80.

2. Subtract the savings from the original price to find the total cost:
   - Total cost = Original price - Savings = $400 - $80 = $320.

Therefore, the total cost if Ethan made his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday, which is:
\[ 14 \times 2 = 28 \text{ pairs} \]

On the last day of the sale, they sold one-half the amount that they did on Saturday, which is:
\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ pairs} \]

However, six pairs were returned because they didn't fit, so the actual number of pairs sold on the last day is:
\[ 14 - 6 = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

To find the total number of pairs sold over the three days, we add the pairs sold each day:
\[ 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \text{ pairs} \]

Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, the total number of tennis shoes sold is:
\[ 50 \times 2 = 100 \text{ shoes} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"

"First, we need to determine the value of the faulty pieces of equipment. Since 40% of the total equipment is faulty, we calculate 40% of $400,000:

\[ 0.40 \times 400,000 = 160,000 \]

This means the faulty pieces of equipment are worth $160,000. Therefore, the value of the functioning pieces of equipment is the total value minus the value of the faulty pieces:

\[ 400,000 - 160,000 = 240,000 \]

So, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is:

First, calculate the number of sheep in each group:
- Half of 30 sheep is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) sheep.

Next, calculate the total milk produced by each group:
- The 15 sheep that produce 1 kg of milk each day produce \( 15 \times 1 = 15 \) kg of milk.
- The 15 sheep that produce 2 kg of milk each day produce \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \) kg of milk.

Finally, add the milk from both groups to find the total daily milk collection:
- Total milk = \( 15 + 30 = 45 \) kg.

Therefore, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day."
"Mrs. Sherman initially made a dozen bread rolls, which is 12 rolls.

After feeding her 6 children, the number of rolls left is:
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

\[ 6 \times 8 = 48 \]

So, the number of pieces of rolls she fed to the chickens is:
\[ 48 \]"
"First, let's determine how many pupils like blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we calculate:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, 20 pupils like blue. This leaves:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

pupils who do not like blue. Out of these remaining 20 pupils, one-fourth likes green. So, the number of pupils who like green is:

\[ \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of pupils who like yellow is the remaining pupils after accounting for those who like blue and green:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

So, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's determine how many apples Lucy sold on Monday. Since she sold the apples at $4 per piece and made $56, we can calculate the number of apples sold on Monday as follows:

\[
\text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{\$56}{\$4 \text{ per apple}} = 14 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, we know that on Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is:

\[
\text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days by summing the apples picked each day:

\[
\text{Total apples picked} = \text{Apples picked on Monday} + \text{Apples picked on Tuesday} + \text{Apples picked on Wednesday}
\]

Since the apples picked on Monday were all sold, the number of apples picked on Monday is the same as the number sold, which is 14 apples. Therefore:

\[
\text{Total apples picked} = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50
\]

Thus, the total number of apples picked over the three days is:

\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"Lindsay started with 50 socks. She washed 10 pairs of socks, which is 20 socks, and 15 loose socks. So, the total number of socks she washed is:

\[ 20 + 15 = 35 \]

\[ 50 - 35 = 15 \]

Therefore, Lindsay has missed 15 socks."
"Rachel initially had 23 cookies and received 42 more from Janet. So, the total number of cookies she had before her brother ate any is:

\[ 23 + 42 = 65 \]

Her brother then ate 44 cookies. To find out how many cookies are left, we subtract the number of cookies eaten from the total number of cookies:

\[ 65 - 44 = 21 \]

So, the final number of cookies left for Rachel is:

\[ 21 \]"
"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, we calculate the total interest over the five months. The interest rate is 10% per year, so for five months, the interest rate is:

\[ \text{Interest rate for 5 months} = \frac{10\% \times 5}{12} = \frac{10}{12}\% = \frac{10}{1200} = \frac{1}{120} \]

The interest on the principal amount of $3,650 for five months is:

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times \frac{1}{120} = 30.4167 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 30.4167 = 3680.4167 \]

Since she has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3680.4167}{5} = 736.08334 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:

"To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's hiking speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

Distance hiked by Cho = Speed × Time
\[ \text{Distance hiked by Cho} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{h} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's hiking speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

Distance hiked by Chloe = Speed × Time
\[ \text{Distance hiked by Chloe} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{h} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance hiked by Cho} - \text{Distance hiked by Chloe} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"First, let's determine the number of silver and gold pesos Anna has.

- Axel has 50 silver pesos. Since Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, Anna has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos.
- Axel has 80 gold pesos. Since Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, Anna has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Next, we calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos Axel and Anna have together.

- Total silver pesos: Axel's 50 silver pesos + Anna's 100 silver pesos = \(50 + 100 = 150\) silver pesos.
- Total gold pesos: Axel's 80 gold pesos + Anna's 120 gold pesos = \(80 + 120 = 200\) gold pesos.

Finally, we add the total number of silver and gold pesos to find the total number of pesos they have together.

- Total number of pesos: \(150 + 200 = 350\).

The total number of pesos they have together is \(\boxed{350}\)."
"First, let's determine the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She has 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. Therefore, the total number of cups of lemonade she can make is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to account for the cost of the supplies. Millie spent $18 on supplies. Therefore, her profit from selling all the lemonade is:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find out how much profit she makes per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade. Since she sells 36 cups and sells 4 cups per hour, the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, her profit per hour is:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

Therefore, the profit Millie makes per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:

\[ \$2 \]"
"Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther originally had as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, the total amount of land Mr. Ruther originally had is:

\[
\boxed{32}

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 52 \times 0.5 = 26 \]

On the day of the performance, only the female members are performing. So, initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform. However, half of these girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

\[ \text{Number of girls who can't make it} = 26 \times 0.5 = 13 \]

So, the number of girls who actually perform is:

\[ \text{Number of girls who perform} = 26 - 13 = 13 \]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[ \text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"

"First, let's calculate the cost for David if he buys a ride bracelet:

- A ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha if she buys tickets for each ride:

- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost per ride for Dasha is \(2 \text{ tickets} \times \$2 \text{ per ticket} = \$4\).
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \text{ rides} \times \$4 \text{ per ride} = \$36\).

Now, let's compare the costs:

- David's cost: $30 (for the bracelet).
- Dasha's cost: $36 (for tickets).

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract David's cost from Dasha's cost:

\[
\$36 - \$30 = \$6
\]

Therefore, David saves \(\boxed{6}\) dollars."

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

First, we need to find the total parts of the ratio:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

This means the total number of popsicles (165) is divided into 11 parts. To find the value of one part, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services before the bundle discount:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu costs $10 a month.
- Disney Plus costs $10 a month.

So, the total cost without the bundle discount is:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, since Tim gets a 20% discount for bundling these services, we need to calculate the discounted cost. A 20% discount means he pays 80% of the original cost:
\[ 30 \times 0.80 = 24 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, let's compare this to the cost of his old cable subscription, which was $60 per month. The savings from cancelling the cable subscription and switching to the streaming services is:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's break down the time Carol spends on each activity:

1. Writing a song: 4 hours
2. Recording: half the time spent writing, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) hours
3. Editing: 90 minutes, which is \( \frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \) hours

Next, we calculate the total work time:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 7.5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to find what percentage of the total work time was spent editing. The time spent editing is 1.5 hours, and the total work time is 7.5 hours. The percentage is calculated as follows:
\[ \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is:

"First, let's determine the total number of books that can fit in the shelving system. The system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total number of books it can hold is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Next, we need to find out how many books Wendy wants to place. According to the problem, she wants to place 20 more than double the number of books that the system can hold. So, we calculate double the capacity of the system and then add 20:

\[ 2 \times 36 = 72 \]
\[ 72 + 20 = 92 \]

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry \(\boxed{92}\) books to complete her task."
"First, let's calculate the total number of Valentine's cards Erica initially had:

- Erica made 20 cards.
- Her dad brought 2 boxes with 15 cards each, so \(2 \times 15 = 30\) cards.

Adding these together, Erica initially had \(20 + 30 = 50\) cards.

Next, let's account for the cards she passed out and received:

- She passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
- She passed out 5 cards to her family.
- She received 17 cards from family and friends.

So, the total number of cards she passed out is \(24 + 5 = 29\).

Now, let's calculate the net change in the number of cards:

- Cards passed out: 29
- Cards received: 17

The net change is \(17 - 29 = -12\), meaning she lost 12 cards.

Finally, the number of cards Erica now has is the initial number of cards minus the net change:

\[50 - 12 = 38\]

So, Erica now has \(\boxed{38}\) Valentine's Day cards."
"First, let's calculate how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Next, Jenny gives \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pizza to Mark. Since the pizza has 12 slices:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices herself. So, we subtract the slices she eats from the total number of slices:
\[ 12 - 7 - 2 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the number of slices left is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Mark currently has $50 in his bank account and needs $300 to buy a bike. The difference he needs to save is:

Therefore, Mark needs to save for 25 days."
"First, let's determine the number of millipedes Nancy saw. Since she saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, and she saw 90 spiders, the number of millipedes is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \]

Next, we need to find out how many stink bugs she saw. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \]

Now, we add up all the bugs she saw: spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs.

\[ 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 \]

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is:

\[ \boxed{168} \]"

"First, let's determine the amount of flour and milk needed for a quadruple batch of brownies.

For flour:
- Normal recipe: 3 cups
- Quadruple batch: \(3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups}\)

For milk:
- Normal recipe: 1 cup
- Quadruple batch: \(1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups}\)

Next, we calculate how many 2-cup bags of flour Mark needs:
- \(12 \text{ cups} \div 2 \text{ cups per bag} = 6 \text{ bags}\)

Then, we calculate how many 2-cup bottles of milk Mark needs:
- \(4 \text{ cups} \div 2 \text{ cups per bottle} = 2 \text{ bottles}\)

Finally, we find the difference between the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk:

"First, let's calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when it is used for 8 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. Therefore, for 8 hours, the energy consumption is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the energy consumption to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Next, we calculate the daily energy consumption if the air conditioner is used for 3 hours a day (8 hours - 5 hours):
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Therefore, the total kilowatts of electric energy saved in 30 days is:

"To determine how much money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of sandwiches needed:**
   - Each sandwich serves 4 people.
   - There are 20 people in total.
   - Number of sandwiches needed = \( \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \).

2. **Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed:**
   - Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   - For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of meat needed = \( 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \).
   - For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of cheese needed = \( 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds} \).

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese:**
   - The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound.
   - The cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound.
   - Total cost of meat = \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times 7 \text{ dollars per pound} = 35 \text{ dollars} \).
   - Total cost of cheese = \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times 3 \text{ dollars per pound} = 15 \text{ dollars} \).

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of meat + Cost of cheese = \( 35 \text{ dollars} + 15 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars} \).

"First, let's determine the initial number of corns Allan has. According to the problem, there are twice as many corns as cannolis. Since Allan has 40 cannolis, the number of corns is:

\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis. Therefore, the new total number of cannolis is:

\[ 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Allan also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 cannolis, the number of corns he bought is:

\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Adding these 20 corns to the initial 80 corns, the new total number of corns is:

\[ 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, we need to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house. Adding the new totals together, we get:

\[ 100 + 100 = 200 \]

Thus, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:

"Elliott finished half of his 10,000 steps on his walks to and from school. So, he walked 5,000 steps to and from school.

He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. Therefore, the total steps before his jog were:
\[ 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \]

After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. This means he had already taken:
\[ 10000 - 2000 = 8000 \]

The number of steps Elliott took during his jog is the difference between the total steps he had taken before his jog and the total steps he had taken after his jog:
\[ 8000 - 6000 = 2000 \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:

\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we determine how long it will take Toby to read the book at his reading rate of 300 words per minute:

\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby needs to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 10 minutes to get there. Therefore, he needs to leave 10 minutes before the 60-minute mark:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Since it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, he will leave at:

\[ 50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Toby will be:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 20 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May.

1. **Number of employees in May**: 40
2. **Hourly wage**: $15
3. **Hours worked per week**: 40

The weekly pay for one employee in May is:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 600 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in May, the total pay for one employee in May is:
\[ 600 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

For 40 employees, the total pay in May is:
\[ 2400 \text{ dollars/employee} \times 40 \text{ employees} = 96000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in June.

1. **Number of employees at the start of June**: 40
2. **1/4 of the employees' contracts expired in June**: 
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ employees} \]

So, the number of employees remaining in June is:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ employees} \]

The weekly pay for one employee in June is still:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 600 \text{ dollars/week} \]

For 30 employees, the total pay in June is:
\[ 600 \text{ dollars/week} \times 30 \text{ employees} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 72000 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. This means the second pound of taffy is half the price of the first pound, which is $3 / 2 = $1.50. Therefore, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashells, which is $1.50.

Then, we calculate the cost of the magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25, and she bought 4 magnets, so the total cost for the magnets is $0.25 * 4 = $1.00.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Taffy: $4.50
- Seashells: $1.50
- Magnets: $1.00

The total cost is $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00.

Sally started with $10.00. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is $10.00 - $7.00 = $3.00.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the second pack of fireworks. Since it's worth twice the amount of the first pack, we have:

\[ 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

Next, we add the cost of the first pack and the second pack to find the total cost before the discount:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Tim gets a 20% discount on these fireworks. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $1200:

\[ 0.20 \times 1200 = 240 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost of the fireworks to find the discounted price:

\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted price of the fireworks:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12 cookies) at a time, we need to determine how many dozens of cookies she needs to make to have 60 cookies:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to last her for 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of candles that are more dangerous:**
   - Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of the candles are more dangerous and have a higher risk of exploding.
   - If she makes 50,000 candles, the number of more dangerous candles is:
     \[
     50,000 \times 0.01 = 500
     \]

2. **Determine the number of more dangerous candles that also have a defect:**
   - 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.
   - Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and are more dangerous is:
     \[
     500 \times 0.05 = 25
     \]

So, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"First, calculate the discount price of each blouse. Since the blouses are on a 30% off rack, the discount is 30% of the regular price of $20.

\[ \text{Discount per blouse} = 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

So, the discounted price per blouse is:

\[ \text{Discounted price per blouse} = 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost for the 4 blouses is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
3. Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \( x \).

Joanne's total apples are:
\[ 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x \]

Next, we know that Joanne's sister gathers:
- Twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- Three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- No apples from the average trees.

So, Joanne's sister's total apples are:
\[ 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \]

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ (45 + x) + 105 = 500 \]

Simplify and solve for \( x \):
\[ 150 + x = 500 \]
\[ x = 500 - 150 \]
\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered \(\boxed{350}\) apples from the average trees."
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( c \) and the number of dromedaries as \( d \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of heads is 180, which means \( c + d = 180 \).
2. The total number of humps is 304, which means \( 2c + d = 304 \) because camels have 2 humps each and dromedaries have 1 hump each.

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To solve for \( c \) and \( d \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2c + d - c - d = 124 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Now that we know \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[ 124 + d = 180 \]
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( \boxed{56} \)."
"First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days:
\[ 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \]

Next, we calculate the distance he traveled over the next two days, which is 30% of the distance traveled in the first four days:
\[ 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \]

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is:
\[ 0 \text{ km} \]

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days:
\[ 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \]

Now, we sum up all the distances:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ 3140 \text{ km} \]"
"Given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is \(\frac{1}{4}\) the size of Zack's locker, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2:

\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"Stanley's comb fell from an elevation of 10,000 feet to a ledge at 6,000 feet (10,000 feet - 4,000 feet). Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To reach the comb, Oliver must climb from 3,000 feet to 6,000 feet.

The number of feet Oliver must climb is:
6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet

Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To determine how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money given by the second bank.
2. Add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital.

First, the second bank gave Mr. Josue twice as much as the first bank. Since the first bank gave $4000, the second bank gave:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, the total capital Mr. Josue has now is:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.

First, 4 boats came and each carried away 5 cats:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cats} \]

Subtract the 20 cats that were carried away from the initial 50 cats:
\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \text{ cats} \]

Next, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \text{ cats} \]

Subtract the 18 cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining 30 cats:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \text{ cats} \]

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is:
\[ 12 \]"
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into the different pricing periods.

1. **First 6 months at $8 per month:**
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 per month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96
   \]

3. **The remaining 10 months at $14 per month:**
   \[
   10 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$140
   \]

"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The problem states that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:
\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out the total amount Cole saved. The problem states that he saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can set up the following equations. Let \( S_j \) be the savings from the jogger jeans and \( S_t \) be the savings from the tattered jeans. We know:
\[ S_j + S_t = 6 \]
\[ S_j = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
\[ S_t = 6 - 2 = 4 \]

The savings from the jogger jeans is the difference between the original price and the sale price. Let \( P_j \) be the original price of the jogger jeans. The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, so the savings from the jogger jeans is:
\[ P_j - 22 = 2 \]
Solving for \( P_j \):
\[ P_j = 22 + 2 = 24 \]

The savings from the tattered jeans is the difference between the original price and the sale price. Let \( P_t \) be the original price of the tattered jeans. The sale price of the tattered jeans is $28, so the savings from the tattered jeans is:
\[ P_t - 28 = 4 \]
Solving for \( P_t \):
\[ P_t = 28 + 4 = 32 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:
\[ P_t - P_j = 32 - 24 = 8 \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost \(\boxed{8}\) dollars more than the tattered jeans."
"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum these capacities.

1. **Buses:**
   - Number of buses: 4
   - Capacity per bus: 60 employees
   - Total capacity for buses: \( 4 \times 60 = 240 \) employees

2. **Minibusses:**
   - Number of minibusses: 6
   - Capacity per minibus: 30 employees
   - Total capacity for minibusses: \( 6 \times 30 = 180 \) employees

3. **Minivans:**
   - Number of minivans: 10
   - Capacity per minivan: 15 employees
   - Total capacity for minivans: \( 10 \times 15 = 150 \) employees

"First, let's determine the number of birds attracted by each type of bird feeder. According to the problem, each store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds, and each bird feeder Lillian made herself attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. Therefore, each of Lillian's homemade bird feeders attracts:

\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ birds} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought bird feeders. Lillian buys 3 store-bought bird feeders, so the total number of birds attracted by these feeders is:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ birds} \]

Similarly, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by the homemade bird feeders. Lillian builds 3 homemade bird feeders, so the total number of birds attracted by these feeders is:

\[ 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ birds} \]

To find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we add the number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders and the homemade feeders:

\[ 60 + 90 = 150 \text{ birds} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{150} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money Kenny needs to buy the ticket:**
   - The ticket costs $100.

2. **Determine the amount of money Kenny has after buying the ticket:**
   - Kenny has $50 in spending cash after buying the ticket.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Kenny made from selling the cards:**
   - Total money = Cost of ticket + Spending cash
   - Total money = $100 + $50 = $150

4. **Determine the number of cards Kenny sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - Number of cards sold = Total money / Price per card
   - Number of cards sold = $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards

5. **Determine the total number of cards Kenny started with:**
   - Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards and sells the rest.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of cards Kenny started with.
   - Number of cards sold = \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \)
   - We know the number of cards sold is 100.
   - \(\frac{2x}{3} = 100\)
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     2x = 100 \times 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 300
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{300}{2} = 150
     \]

Therefore, Kenny started with \(\boxed{150}\) cards."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare enough hotdogs for 36 guests.
   - Half of the guests (18 guests) were to have 2 hotdogs each.
   - Therefore, the caterer prepared \(18 \times 2 = 36\) hotdogs for these guests.

2. **Additional Guests:**
   - 40 guests showed up, which is 4 more than the initial 36 guests.
   - The caterer had already prepared 36 hotdogs for the initial 36 guests.
   - Since 40 guests showed up, and 36 hotdogs were already prepared, there are \(40 - 36 = 4\) guests who did not get a second hotdog.

3. **Second Hotdogs for Remaining Guests:**
   - The remaining 4 guests would have wanted a second hotdog, but there were no extra hotdogs available.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"First, we determine the number of letters in Indras' name, which is 6.

Next, we calculate half of the letters in Indras' name:
\[
\frac{6}{2} = 3
\]

Then, we find the number of letters in her sister's name, which is 4 more than half of Indras' name:
\[
3 + 4 = 7
\]

Finally, we add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name to get the total:
\[
6 + 7 = 13

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Set of mixing bowls: $20.00
- 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each: \(5 \times 5 = 25.00\)

Adding these together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. We calculate 80% of $165.00:
\[ 165.00 \times 0.80 = 132.00 \]

Therefore, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
\[ \boxed{132.00} \]"

"First, let's determine how many dragons Prince Arthur slew. Since Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, and Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons, we calculate:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Next, we find out how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Now, we need to determine how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much gasoline each container holds. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needs in gallons. Josey needs \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons by 8 pints per gallon:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline. 

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money George had left after his purchases. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can calculate the amount of money he had left as follows:

\[ \text{Money left} = 5 \times \frac{1}{100} = 0.05 \text{ dollars} \]

This means George spent:

\[ 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the 3 bags of chips:

\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars:

\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each candy bar costs 0.75 dollars, we can determine the number of candy bars he bought by dividing the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:

\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

So, George bought \(\boxed{5}\) candy bars."
"Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, the number of lollipops he shared with his friends is \(25 - 5 = 20\).

Each of his friends received 5 lollipops."
"Rory's cake weighs 20 ounces in total and is cut into 8 pieces. If Rory and her mom each have one piece, that means 2 pieces are eaten. Since the cake was divided equally, each piece weighs:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} \]

So, the weight of the 2 pieces eaten is:

\[ 2 \text{ pieces} \times 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the remaining weight of the cake is:

\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have together:

Juris has 22 oranges.

Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56 oranges.

Next, we need to determine how many people will be sharing these oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing with 6 other friends, so the total number of people is:

2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 (friends) = 8 people.

Now, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of people to find out how many oranges each person will get:

56 oranges ÷ 8 people = 7 oranges per person.

Therefore, each person will get 7 oranges."
"First, let's determine the total amount of onions Antoine will use. He doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. Therefore, he will use:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound, so the cost for 4 pounds is:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is on sale for $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock is:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Adding the cost of the onions and the beef stock gives us the total cost of the ingredients:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Therefore, the cost per serving is:

"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can find the width by rearranging the formula:
\[ \text{width} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{length}} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle using the perimeter formula:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:
\[ 98 \text{ feet} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought:

- Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads.
- Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 3 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 3 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought:

- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.
- Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 7 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 7 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other:

\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth."
"Initially, Marcus's house is at 40 degrees.

He spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. Therefore, the temperature increase from the oven is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

Adding this to the initial temperature:
\[ 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Therefore, the total cooling effect is:
\[ \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/2 degrees}} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

Subtracting this cooling effect from the temperature after baking:
\[ 55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees} \]

Thus, the final temperature of the house is:
\[ 49 \text{ degrees} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time James took for the swim is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. So, the time James took for the bike is:
\[ 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( x \) be the time James took for the run. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, the total time for James is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

So, the time James took for the run is 59 minutes."
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C into minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is:

\[ 1.25 \times 60 = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B is:

\[ 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

"First, let's determine how far Michael's horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

1. Convert 30 minutes to hours: \( \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \).

2. Calculate the distance the horse runs: \( 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we need to find out how much hay the horse eats for 16 miles. Since the horse eats \( \frac{1}{2} \) a bail of hay per mile:

3. Calculate the total hay consumed: \( 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails} \).

Now, we need to find out the total cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3:

4. Calculate the total cost of the hay: \( 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \).

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:

5. Calculate the total amount of money Michael has: \( 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \).

Finally, we need to find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay:

6. Calculate the change: \( 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \).

Therefore, the change Michael has after buying the hay is \( \boxed{6} \)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has:

- She uses 4 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs.
- She also uses 2 additional eggs.

So, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Each glass requires 5 eggs. Therefore, the number of glasses of eggnog she can make is:

\[
\frac{50 \text{ eggs}}{5 \text{ eggs/glass}} = 10 \text{ glasses}
\]

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, the number of trays Rozanne can put out is:

\[
\frac{10 \text{ glasses}}{5 \text{ glasses/tray}} = 2 \text{ trays}
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}

"First, let's calculate the cost per sneaker. The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576, so the cost per sneaker is:

\[ \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday. The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each:

\[ \text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars} \]

The remaining sneakers are:

\[ 48 - 17 = 31 \text{ sneakers} \]

These were sold to a department store for $25 each:

\[ \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars} \]

The total revenue from all sales is:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost of the sneakers is $576. Therefore, the profit is:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars} \]

The salesman's profit is:

\[ \boxed{539} \]"

"Let's break down the costs:

1. **Super Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $20
   - Popcorn with soda: $1 extra
   - Total cost with super ticket: $20 + $1 = $21

2. **Regular Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $12
   - Popcorn: $x (unknown regular price)
   - Soda: $3
   - Total cost without super ticket: $12 + $x + $3 = $15 + $x

According to the problem, you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket. Therefore, the cost of the regular ticket option should be $2 more than the cost of the super ticket option.

So, we set up the equation:
\[ 15 + x = 21 + 2 \]
\[ 15 + x = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 - 15 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

The regular price of the popcorn is $8.

**Final Answer:**
The regular price of the popcorn is $8."
"First, we need to determine the cost of filling one helium balloon before the price increase. The total cost for 20 balloons was $900, so the cost per balloon is:

\[
\frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars per balloon}
\]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[
45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars per balloon}
\]

Now, we need to calculate the cost for Bentley to fill 170 balloons at the new price. The total cost is:

"To find the car's average speed during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then use the formula for average speed:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

First, calculate the distance traveled at each speed:
- For the first part of the trip, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours:
  \[ \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

- For the second part of the trip, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour:
  \[ \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, calculate the total distance:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, calculate the total time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

Finally, calculate the average speed:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph} \]

The car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."

\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Nancy will eat:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Together, they will eat:
\[ 120 \text{ apples} + 120 \text{ apples} = 240 \text{ apples} \]

Therefore, the total number of apples they eat in 30 days is:
\[ 240 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed. The volume of a raised bed is given by its width, length, and height:

\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume of soil} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{\$/bag} = 1920 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, the potting soil will cost Bob $1920."
"First, let's determine the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = Number of red cards + 60% of the number of red cards
Number of green cards = 15 + 0.60 * 15
Number of green cards = 15 + 9
Number of green cards = 24

Next, we calculate the number of yellow cards. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the number of red and green cards:

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24
Number of yellow cards = 39

Now, we sum up all the cards:

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39
Total number of cards = 78

Therefore, the total number of cards is 78."
"Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. After twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn, which is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) fairies. These 25 fairies joined the 50 fairies already there, making the total number of fairies \( 50 + 25 = 75 \). Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away, so the number of fairies remaining is \( 75 - 30 = 45 \).

The final number of fairies remaining is:
\[

"First, let's determine the total number of puppies:

- Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies.
- Brandon's dog has 12 puppies.

Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20 puppies.

Next, let's find out how many of these puppies have spots:

- Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots.
- Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots.

Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7 puppies.

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.35 \times 100 = 35\% \]

Therefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed the farmer is buying:

1. **Sugar Cubes**: 2 boxes at 1 pound each
   \[
   2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Carrots**: 4 bags at 12 pounds each
   \[
   4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Hay**: 42 bales at 75 pounds each
   \[
   42 \times 75 = 3150 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Oats**: 20 sacks at 65 pounds each
   \[
   20 \times 65 = 1300 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we sum up the total weight of all the feed:
\[
2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips the farmer needs, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since a fraction of a trip is not possible):
\[
\frac{4500}{2250} = 2
\]

Therefore, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."
"First, let's calculate how much Grayson earns from recycling aluminum cans in a week. She recycles three aluminum cans, and each can is worth two cents. So, the weekly earnings from cans are:
\[ 3 \text{ cans} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from recycling plastic bottles in a week. She recycles five plastic bottles, and each bottle is worth three cents. So, the weekly earnings from bottles are:
\[ 5 \text{ bottles} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents} \]

Now, let's find out how much she earns in total from recycling both cans and bottles in a week:
\[ 6 \text{ cents} + 15 \text{ cents} = 21 \text{ cents} \]

Since we need to find out how much she earns in a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:

Therefore, the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man is $18."
"Let's break down Finley's position changes step by step:

1. She started in first place.
2. She fell back 5 spots: \(1 - 5 = -4\). Since she can't be in a negative spot, we adjust this to the last possible position, which is 100 (assuming a 100-spot race).
3. She then moved ahead 2 spots: \(100 + 2 = 102\). Again, adjusting to the last possible position, this becomes 100.
4. She fell behind 3 spots: \(100 - 3 = 97\).
5. Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot: \(97 + 1 = 98\).

So, Finley finished in 98th place.

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. So, we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat \(\boxed{6}\) carrot sticks."
"First, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each 6-inch remora is:

\[ \frac{6 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 0.5 \text{ feet} \]

Benny saw two remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:

\[ 2 \times 0.5 \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \left( \frac{\text{combined length of remoras}}{\text{shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

Therefore, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length. 

10%"

Therefore, each child received 5 books."
"To find out how many kids in Gina's class are not allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion.

First, let's define the sets:
- Let \( D \) be the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- Let \( P \) be the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

From the problem, we know:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

We need to find the number of kids who are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. This can be calculated using the principle of inclusion and exclusion:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - |D \cup P| = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel during the busy weekend. The normal price is $1500 per day, and it is 20% more expensive during the busy weekend.

\[ \text{Increase in price} = 1500 \times 0.20 = 300 \]

So, the cost per day during the busy weekend is:

\[ 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:

\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Each ticket costs $5000, and there are two tickets:

\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:

\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the trip is:

\[ \boxed{15400} \]"
"First, let's determine how many tubes of blue paint Jasper has. Since Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, and Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint, Jasper has:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ tubes of blue paint} \]

Next, let's determine how many tubes of yellow paint Jasper has. Since Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, and Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint, Jasper has:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ tubes of yellow paint} \]

Now, we add the number of blue and yellow paint tubes that Jasper has to find the total number of paint tubes:

\[ 2 + 9 = 11 \]

Therefore, Jasper has a total of 11 tubes of paint."
"The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains. The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. Therefore, the weight of the 2010 penny is:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 48 = 36 \text{ grains}
\]

To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we add the weight of the 1959 penny and the 2010 penny:

\[
48 + 36 = 84 \text{ grains}
\]

The combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains."
"By 3 pm, Keegan and Tashay had collectively earned $83 (Keegan) + $91 (Tasha) = $174.

Their goal was to raise $200. Therefore, the amount they still need to earn is $200 - $174 = $26.

They need to earn $26 more to reach their goal."
"First, let's determine how many songs Luri has on her player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

So, Luri has 60 songs on her player.

Next, we need to find out how many more songs Gabriel's player can hold. Since his player can hold up to 100 songs and he currently has 20 songs, the number of additional songs he can add is:

\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]

Now, we calculate how many more songs Luri's player can hold. Since her player can also hold up to 100 songs and she currently has 60 songs, the number of additional songs she can add is:

\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add to her player than Gabriel can add to his, we subtract the number of additional songs Luri can add from the number of additional songs Gabriel can add:

\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Therefore, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to her player than Gabriel can add to his. 

Final answer:
\[ 40 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many oranges Stetson ate. Since he ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 oranges they picked, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. According to the bet, he gives up $10 for each orange he eats. Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is:

\[
24 \times 10 = 240
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"First, we need to determine how much 3 times the cost of Jillian's shoes is. Since her shoes cost $80, we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 80 = 240 \]

Next, we need to find out how much her handbag cost, which is $20 less than $240. So, we subtract $20 from $240:

\[ 240 - 20 = 220 \]

Therefore, the cost of Jillian's handbag is:

\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"First, calculate the total miles James runs in a week:

\[ 12 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 60 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, since he runs at a pace of 10 miles per hour, we can find the total hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles by his speed:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, James runs a total of 6 hours a week."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of oats consumed by one horse per day. Since each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal and is fed twice a day, one horse consumes:

\[ 5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses per day:

\[ 10 \text{ pounds/day/horse} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses over five days:

\[ 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to determine how many bags are required to provide 200 pounds of oats:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags} \]

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days."
"First, we calculate the number of Pomeranians Jana has. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 27 = 18
\]

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians. Next, we need to find out how many of these Pomeranians are girls. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
\]

Therefore, the number of girl Pomeranians Jana has is:

\[
\boxed{6}
\]"
"To find the average highest temperature of the three countries, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the highest temperatures for each country:
   - Southlandia: -48 degrees Fahrenheit
   - Northlandia: 21 degrees Fahrenheit
   - Midlandia: -3 degrees Fahrenheit

2. Sum these temperatures:
   \[
   -48 + 21 + (-3) = -48 + 21 - 3 = -30
   \]

3. Divide the sum by the number of countries (3) to find the average:
   \[
   \frac{-30}{3} = -10
   \]

The average highest temperature of these three countries is \(-10\) degrees Fahrenheit."
"First, we need to determine how much more money the child needs to save to buy the toy car. The toy car costs $12 and the child already has $4 saved. So, the remaining amount needed is:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining $8 if he saves $2 each day. We do this by dividing the remaining amount by the daily savings:

\[ 8 \div 2 = 4 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take the child \(\boxed{4}\) days to save the remaining amount of money."
"First, we calculate the total capacity of the trays Jaime has. Since each tray can hold 24 eggs and he has 2 trays, the total capacity is:

\[ 24 \text{ eggs/tray} \times 2 \text{ trays} = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we determine how many eggs Jaime has, which is 64 eggs. To find out how many eggs won't be able to be placed on the tray, we subtract the total capacity of the trays from the number of eggs:

\[ 64 \text{ eggs} - 48 \text{ eggs} = 16 \text{ eggs} \]

Therefore, the number of eggs that won't be able to be placed on the tray is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, we calculate the cost of the family-size pizza. Since it costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, and the small pizza costs $8, the family-size pizza costs:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount Sally spends:

\[ 8 + 24 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Sally spends a total of $32."
"First, let's determine the cost of 2 packs of razors before any discounts. Each pack costs $4.00, so 2 packs cost:
\[ 2 \times 4.00 = 8.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the razors are on sale with a ""buy one get one free"" offer, Heather only needs to pay for 1 pack to get the second one free. Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is the same as the cost of 1 pack:
\[ 4.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the $2.00 coupon to the $4.00 cost:
\[ 4.00 - 2.00 = 2.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many razors Heather gets for $2.00. Since each pack contains 4 razors and she is buying 2 packs (but only paying for 1), she gets:
\[ 4 \text{ razors from the paid pack} + 4 \text{ razors from the free pack} = 8 \text{ razors} \]

The cost per razor is then:
\[ \frac{2.00 \text{ dollars}}{8 \text{ razors}} = 0.25 \text{ dollars per razor} \]

Converting this to cents (since 1 dollar = 100 cents):
\[ 0.25 \text{ dollars} \times 100 = 25 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost per individual razor is:
\[ 25 \text{ cents} \]"
"First, let's determine the height of the shortest cheerleader, which is 60 inches. In a human pyramid, the height of the pyramid is determined by the height of the topmost person, as they are the highest point.

The height of the human pyramid is therefore 60 inches.

To convert this height into feet, we use the conversion factor that 1 foot = 12 inches.

\[ \text{Height in feet} = \frac{60 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the human pyramid is 5 feet."
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour. Since she works 8 hours a day, she walks \(5 \times 8 = 40\) minutes each day. Over 5 days, she walks \(40 \times 5 = 200\) minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be \(14 + 4 = 18\) years old.
3. At that time, Angela will be three times Brett's current age. Brett's current age is 14, so three times that is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

This means that in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. To find out how old Angela is right now, we subtract 4 years from 42.

So, Angela's current age is \(42 - 4 = 38\).

Therefore, Angela is currently \(\boxed{38}\) years old."
"To calculate the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost for the morning rides.
2. Calculate the total cost for the afternoon rides.
3. Add the two amounts together to get the total cost.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost for the morning rides.**
- Paul drives in the morning 14 days.
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- Total cost for morning rides = 14 days * $6/day = $84.

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost for the afternoon rides.**
- Paul drives in the afternoon 14 days.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- Total cost for afternoon rides = 14 days * $2/day = $28.

**Step 3: Add the two amounts together.**
- Total cost = Cost for morning rides + Cost for afternoon rides
- Total cost = $84 + $28 = $112.

Therefore, Paul spent a total of $112 on driving his car during these two weeks."
"First, let's determine the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, we need to find out how many oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, we add the oranges brought by Ashley and Brianne to find the total number of oranges:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges, we divide the total number of oranges by three to find out how many pies they can make:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's denote the number of guests as \( x \).

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200 plus $5 per guest for food. So, the total cost for the first venue is:
\[ 200 + 5x \]

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per guest, which includes food. So, the total cost for the second venue is:
\[ 25x \]

We need to find the number of guests \( x \) for which the costs of the two venues are equal. Therefore, we set the two expressions equal to each other:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \(D\), by Lily as \(L\), and by Bodhi as \(B\).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \(L + D + B = 43\)
2. \(L = D + 7\)
3. \(D = \frac{1}{2}B\)

First, we can express \(B\) in terms of \(D\):
\[B = 2D\]

Next, we substitute \(L\) and \(B\) in terms of \(D\) into the first equation:
\[L + D + B = 43\]
\[(D + 7) + D + 2D = 43\]
\[4D + 7 = 43\]
\[4D = 36\]
\[D = 9\]

Now that we know \(D = 9\), we can find \(L\) and \(B\):
\[L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16\]
\[B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18\]

So, Lily found \(\boxed{16}\) insects."
"First, we calculate the amount of yarn Mariah used:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \text{ of a skein} = \frac{1}{4} \times 364 \text{ yards} = 91 \text{ yards} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of yarn Mariah's grandma used:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \text{ of a skein} = \frac{1}{2} \times 364 \text{ yards} = 182 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we add the amounts of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma to find the total:
\[ 91 \text{ yards} + 182 \text{ yards} = 273 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is:
\[ 273 \text{ yards} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of gifts Cherrie buys for her friends based on their requests:

- 2 friends want 5 gifts each: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) gifts
- 3 friends want 2 gifts each: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) gifts

Adding these together, the total number of gifts based on their requests is:
\[10 + 6 = 16\]

Cherrie also decides to buy 10 more random gifts. So, we add these to the previous total:
\[16 + 10 = 26\]

Therefore, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is:
\[26\]"
"First, let's determine the width of the rug. Given that the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, and the chair is 3 feet wide, the width of the rug is:

\[ \text{Width of the rug} = \text{Width of the chair} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. So, we calculate twice the width of the rug and then add 2 feet:

\[ \text{Length of the couch} = 2 \times \text{Width of the rug} + 2 = 2 \times 8 + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the length of the couch is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. Two of these packs are strawberry.
3. One pack is grape, which costs $2.
4. One pack is green apple, which costs half as much as the grape pack, so it costs $1.
5. The total cost of all packs is $7.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

The total cost equation can be written as:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

Each pack of strawberry gum costs $2."
"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, he should buy the cheapest lumber, which is the 2 x 4 piece of wood. Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks, and each costs $4.

Given Frederick has $24, he can buy:
\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pieces of 2 x 4 wood} \]

Since each piece of 2 x 4 wood provides 200 sticks, the total number of sticks he can make is:
\[ 6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks} \]

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make if he buys the cheapest lumber is:
\[ 1200 \]"
"First, calculate the total number of legs for Mario's 6 sled dogs. Since each dog has 4 legs, the total number of legs is:

\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Next, since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, the number of pairs of snowshoes needed is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs} \]

Given that each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, the total cost for 12 pairs is:

\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times \$12.00 \text{ per pair} = \$144.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:

\[ \$144.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of Janet's bus trips without the weekly bus pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day, and each trip costs $2.20. Therefore, the cost per day is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times \$2.20/\text{trip} = \$4.40/\text{day} \]

Since she takes these trips five days a week, the weekly cost without the pass is:
\[ \$4.40/\text{day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = \$22.00/\text{week} \]

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the weekly bus pass, which is $20.00.

The savings from buying the weekly bus pass would be the difference between the cost of not having the pass and the cost of the pass:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Janet would save:
\[ \$2.00 \]"
"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. According to the problem:

1. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
2. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.

First, let's verify the number of cows in the zoo:
- If the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, then the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.

Next, let's verify the number of sheep on the farm:
- If the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, then the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo:
- The farm has \(30\) cows and \(10\) sheep, so the total number of animals on the farm is \(30 + 10 = 40\).
- The zoo has \(60\) cows and \(20\) sheep, so the total number of animals in the zoo is \(60 + 20 = 80\).

Adding the totals from both the farm and the zoo:
- The combined total number of animals is \(40 + 80 = 120\).

Therefore, the total number of animals in the farm and the zoo combined is:
120"
"Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought, we can determine the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought by dividing the quantities Rose bought by 4.

For onions:
\[ \text{Number of onions Sophia bought} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

For potatoes:
\[ \text{Number of potatoes Sophia bought} = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought at the market is 4."
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total calorie deficit needed:**
   Andy wants to lose 30 pounds. Since it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, the total calorie deficit required is:
   \[
   30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105000 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of days available:**
   Today is December 31st, and Andy's birthday is July 19th. The number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:
   - January: 31 days
   - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
   - March: 31 days
   - April: 30 days
   - May: 31 days
   - June: 30 days
   - July (up to July 19th): 19 days
   Adding these up:
   \[
   31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190 \text{ days}
   \]

3. **Calculate the daily calorie deficit:**
   To find out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days:
   \[
   \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{190 \text{ days}} \approx 552.63 \text{ calories/day}
   \]

Therefore, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 553 calories to reach his goal."
"Gerald earns $30 every day. Since he worked for an entire week, he worked for 7 days. Therefore, his total earnings for the week are:

\[ 30 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ dollars} \]

Gerald spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

"First, let's calculate how much Julie spent on clothes. She spent 20% of $500 on clothes.

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 500 = 0.20 \times 500 = 100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on clothes. Now, let's find out how much money she has left after buying clothes.

\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on CDs. Now, let's find out how much money she has left after buying CDs.

Therefore, the amount of money Julie has left is \(\boxed{300}\)."
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting \( H = 3L \) into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house:
\[ H = 3L = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

So, the house costs $90,000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags that Tara bought.

Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, so the total number of bags is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ bags} \]

Each pack cost $4, so the total cost for 8 packs is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the bags. Tara sold each bag for $8, so the total revenue from selling 40 bags is:
\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 320 - 32 = 288 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the profit Tara earned on her bags is:
\[ \boxed{288} \]"
"To determine the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of punches Joe throws per round.
2. Multiply the number of punches per round by the number of rounds in the fight.

First, we know that Joe throws 25 punches per minute. Each round lasts 3 minutes. Therefore, the number of punches Joe throws in one round is:
\[ 25 \text{ punches/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 75 \text{ punches/round} \]

Next, since the fight consists of 5 rounds, the total number of punches Joe throws in the entire fight is:
\[ 75 \text{ punches/round} \times 5 \text{ rounds} = 375 \text{ punches} \]

Thus, the total number of punches Joe threw is:
\[ \boxed{375} \]"
"First, we determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cookies made by Josh} = \frac{36}{4} = 9 \]

Next, we calculate how many cookies Kelsie made. Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, so:

\[ \text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially.

Ali has:
- Four $10 bills, which amount to \(4 \times 10 = 40\) dollars.
- Six $20 bills, which amount to \(6 \times 20 = 120\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money Ali has is:
\[40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars}\]

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister. Therefore, the amount given to his sister is:
\[\frac{160}{2} = 80 \text{ dollars}\]

After giving $80 to his sister, the remaining amount of money Ali has is:
\[160 - 80 = 80 \text{ dollars}\]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining $80 to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:
\[\frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \text{ dollars}\]

"First, let's convert Rob's time into minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, Rob takes \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes to shingle a house.

Next, we need to calculate double Rob's time. Double Rob's time is \(2 \times 120 = 240\) minutes.

According to the problem, Royce takes 40 minutes more than double Rob's time. Therefore, we add 40 minutes to 240 minutes to find out how long Royce takes. 

So, Royce takes \(240 + 40 = 280\) minutes.

**280**"
"First, let's calculate the number of skeins needed for one set of winter wear for one grandchild:

- Hat: 2 skeins

"First, let's determine the picking rate for each person:

1. **Tony** can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
2. **Bobby** picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby picks \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
3. **Kathy** picks twice as many quarts as Bobby, so Kathy picks \(2 \times 5 = 10\) quarts per hour.
4. **Ricky** picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky picks \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, we add up the picking rates of all four individuals to find the total number of quarts picked per hour:

\[
6 \text{ (Tony)} + 5 \text{ (Bobby)} + 10 \text{ (Kathy)} + 8 \text{ (Ricky)} = 29
\]

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is \(\boxed{29}\)."
"To determine how many loaves of bread the bakers at the Beverly Hills Bakery had left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the total number of loaves baked.
2. Subtract the number of loaves sold in the morning.
3. Subtract the number of loaves sold in the afternoon.
4. Add the number of loaves returned by the grocery store.

Let's do the calculations step by step:

1. Total loaves baked: 200
2. Loaves sold in the morning: 93
3. Loaves sold in the afternoon: 39
4. Loaves returned by the grocery store: 6

First, subtract the loaves sold in the morning from the total:
\[ 200 - 93 = 107 \]

Next, subtract the loaves sold in the afternoon from the remaining loaves:
\[ 107 - 39 = 68 \]

Finally, add the loaves returned by the grocery store to the remaining loaves:
\[ 68 + 6 = 74 \]

So, the number of loaves of bread they had left is:
\[ \boxed{74} \]"
"First, we calculate the number of rows of red tulips Jackson can plant. Since he can fit 6 red tulips in a row and he has 36 red tulips, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips per row:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ red tulips}}{6 \text{ tulips/row}} = 6 \text{ rows of red tulips} \]

Next, we calculate the number of rows of blue tulips Jackson can plant. Since he can fit 8 blue tulips in a row and he has 24 blue tulips, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips per row:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ blue tulips}}{8 \text{ tulips/row}} = 3 \text{ rows of blue tulips} \]

To find the total number of rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we add the number of rows of red tulips to the number of rows of blue tulips:

\[ 6 \text{ rows of red tulips} + 3 \text{ rows of blue tulips} = 9 \text{ rows of flowers} \]

"First, let's calculate Ada's current weekly electric consumption and cost.

1. **Current Daily Consumption:**
   - Ada consumes 12 kilowatts per hour daily.

2. **Current Weekly Consumption:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day, so her daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh) is:
     \[
     12 \text{ kWh/day}
     \]
   - There are 7 days in a week, so her weekly consumption is:
     \[
     12 \text{ kWh/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ kWh/week}
     \]

3. **Current Weekly Cost:**
   - The cost per kWh is $1.50, so her weekly cost is:
     \[
     84 \text{ kWh} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$126
     \]

Next, let's calculate Ada's new weekly electric consumption and cost after adding the new device.

4. **New Daily Consumption:**
   - The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour daily.
   - Adding this to her current daily consumption:
     \[
     12 \text{ kWh/day} + 2 \text{ kWh/day} = 14 \text{ kWh/day}
     \]

5. **New Weekly Consumption:**
   - Her new weekly consumption is:
     \[
     14 \text{ kWh/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 98 \text{ kWh/week}
     \]

6. **New Weekly Cost:**
   - The cost per kWh is still $1.50, so her new weekly cost is:
     \[
     98 \text{ kWh} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$147
     \]

Finally, let's find the difference between her new and old weekly electric bills.

7. **Difference in Weekly Cost:**
   - The difference is:
     \[
     \$147 - \$126 = \$21
     \]

**Final Answer:**
The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is \$21."
"First, let's determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house.

The rate for one person is:
\[ \text{Rate of one person} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} \]

Now, if 5 people are working together, their combined rate would be:
\[ \text{Combined rate of 5 people} = 5 \times \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{5 \text{ houses}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{2 \text{ days}} \]

This means that 5 people can paint a whole house in 2 days. To find out how many hours it would take, we need to convert days into hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"First, let's determine the number of chairs Ophelia has. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, and she has 20 sofas, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = \text{Number of sofas Ophelia has} + 2 = 20 + 2 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Therefore, the number of chairs Jenna has is:

\[ \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 3 \times \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = 3 \times 22 = 66 \]

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the number of sofas Jenna has is:

\[ \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} = \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together. The total number of sofas is:

\[ \text{Total number of sofas} = \text{Number of sofas Ophelia has} + \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} = 20 + 64 = 84 \]

The total number of chairs is:

\[ \text{Total number of chairs} = \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} + \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 22 + 66 = 88 \]

Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs is:

\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = \text{Total number of sofas} + \text{Total number of chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{172} \]"
"First, we need to determine the cost of the headphone set. We know that Tom bought a CD for $4 and the total amount he paid was $48. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set can be calculated as follows:

Total cost - Cost of CD = Cost of headphone set
$48 - $4 = $44

So, the headphone set costs $44.

Next, we need to find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set. If he did not buy the headphone set, he would have had the full $48 to spend on CDs. Since each CD costs $4, the number of CDs he could buy is:

Total money available / Cost per CD = Number of CDs
$48 / $4 = 12

Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 12 CDs if he had not bought the headphone set.

Final numerical answer:
12"
"Josh worked out for 4 hours every week for 8 weeks, which amounts to \(4 \times 8 = 32\) hours. Additionally, he worked out for 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks, which adds up to \(5 \times 2 = 10\) hours. He also worked out for 6 hours in one week, adding another 6 hours. 

To find the total number of hours he has spent working out across the 8 weeks, we sum these amounts:

\[32 + 10 + 6 = 48\]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is 48."
"Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.

1. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]

2. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as those who got off get on the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
   So, the number of passengers on the bus after the first stop is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]

3. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]

4. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than those who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
   So, the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66

"First, let's determine Jame's current age. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, then his current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\).

Next, we need to find out how old Jame will be in 8 years. In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\).

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, we calculate twice Jame's age in 8 years and then subtract 5:
\[2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55.\]
This means that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 55 years old.

To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55:
\[55 - 8 = 47.\]

Now, we need to find the current age difference between Jame and his cousin. Jame is currently 22 years old, and his cousin is currently 47 years old. The age difference is:
\[47 - 22 = 25.\]

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Given that the computer cost $1,100 and Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can determine the cost of the printer as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of the printer} = \text{Cost of the computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We can set up the equation to find the cost of one monitor. Let the cost of one monitor be \( M \). Then the total cost can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Cost of the computer} + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} + \text{Cost of the printer} = 2400 \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]

Subtract 1800 from both sides:

\[ 2M = 600 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ M = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is \( \boxed{300} \) dollars."
"The boys brought back 60 seashells each. According to the problem, the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.

Let's denote the number of seashells brought by each girl as \( G \).

The problem states that each girl brought \( 60 + 4 \times 60 \) seashells.

So, we calculate:
\[ G = 60 + 4 \times 60 \]
\[ G = 60 + 240 \]
\[ G = 300 \]

Each girl brought 300 seashells.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
300"

"The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm thick.

To find the total thickness of the four books, we add their individual thicknesses together:
\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188\]

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma should make to complete her monthly goal of 72 vlogs, we first need to calculate how many vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

- First week: 18 vlogs
- Second week: 21 vlogs
- Third week: 15 vlogs

Adding these together gives the total number of vlogs made in the first three weeks:
\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs per month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:
\[ 72 - 54 = 18 \]

Therefore, Emma should make \(\boxed{18}\) vlogs to complete her monthly goal of 72 vlogs."
"First, calculate the total bill including the tip. The tip is 20% of the $50 dinner bill.

\[ \text{Tip} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

So, the total bill including the tip is:

\[ \text{Total bill} = 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Since the check is to be split evenly, each person pays half of the total bill.

\[ \text{Amount paid by each person} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Therefore, you ended up paying:

"To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April, we first need to break down the month into its halves and understand the relationship between the savings in the first and second halves.

1. **Determine the number of days in each half of April:**
   - April has 30 days.
   - The first half of April has 15 days.
   - The second half of April has 15 days.

2. **Define the daily savings in the first half:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.

3. **Define the daily savings in the second half:**
   - According to the problem, Elvis saves twice as much each day in the second half as he does in the first half.
   - Therefore, he saves \( 2x \) each day in the second half of April.

4. **Calculate the total savings for the first half:**
   - Total savings in the first half = \( 15x \).

5. **Calculate the total savings for the second half:**
   - Total savings in the second half = \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

6. **Set up the equation for the total monthly savings:**
   - The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings from the first and second halves.
   - Therefore, \( 15x + 30x = 45x \).

7. **Equate the total savings to the target:**
   - Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125.
   - So, \( 45x = 1125 \).

8. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25
   \]

9. **Determine the daily savings in the second half:**
   - Since \( x = 25 \), the daily savings in the second half is \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \).

Therefore, Elvis has to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of the month."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples, oranges, and peaches.

- The cost of the apples: \(3 \times \$1.50 = \$4.50\)
- The cost of the oranges: \(5 \times \$0.80 = \$4.00\)
- The cost of the peaches: \(6 \times \$0.75 = \$4.50\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost:
\[
\$4.50 + \$4.00 + \$4.50 = \$13.00
\]

Verna gave $20. To find the change she received, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave:

Therefore, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny."
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Five notebooks at $1.50 each: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)
- Two pens at $0.25 each: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
- One calculator at $12 each: \(1 \times 12 = 12.00\)
- One geometry set at $10 each: \(1 \times 10 = 10.00\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00\]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Daniel has to spend:
\[30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00\]

"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned, we need to break down her sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the amount over $1000.

1. **Commission for the first $1000:**
   - Commission rate for the first $1000 is 30%.
   - Commission amount = $1000 * 30% = $1000 * 0.30 = $300.

2. **Commission for the amount over $1000:**
   - Antonella sold goods worth $2500, so the amount over $1000 is $2500 - $1000 = $1500.
   - Commission rate for the amount over $1000 is 10%.
   - Commission amount = $1500 * 10% = $1500 * 0.10 = $150.

3. **Total commission:**
   - Total commission = Commission for the first $1000 + Commission for the amount over $1000.

\[ 140 \text{ bottles needed} - 48 \text{ bottles he has} = 92 \text{ additional bottles needed} \]

So, Bill will need to buy 92 additional bottles of water."
"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice the time it takes him in cold water. 

In cold water, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. Therefore, twice this time is:
\[ 2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding 2 minutes to this time gives:
\[ 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes on a warm day.

Next, we calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a warm day:
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day. Since it takes him 16 minutes to swim one mile, the time for 3 miles is:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles on a warm day and a cold day:
\[ 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."
"First, let's calculate how much John earns in a day. He earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:
\[ 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \]

Next, we calculate his weekly earnings. He works 4 days a week, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."

"First, let's determine the number of buttons with four holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have two holes, the remaining buttons have four holes. This can be calculated as follows:

\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \]

So, there are 14 buttons with four holes.

Next, we calculate the total number of holes. The 7 buttons with two holes contribute:

\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

The 14 buttons with four holes contribute:

\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of holes:

\[ 14 + 56 = 70 \]

Therefore, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is:

"First, we determine the size of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we calculate:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 \text{ cubic inches} = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we find the size of Peter's locker, which is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker:

\[ \text{Peter's locker size} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \text{ cubic inches} = 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches."
"First, let's determine how many cups of coffee Octavia drinks daily. The daily recommended amount of coffee is 4 cups. Since Octavia drinks half the recommended amount, she drinks:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks. Therefore, Juan drinks:

\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we subtract the recommended amount from his current intake:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups."
"The pet shop had a total of 45 rodents.

"First, let's determine the weight of each person:

1. Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds.
2. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan's weight is \(150 - 20 = 130\) pounds.
3. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob's weight is \(2 \times 130 = 260\) pounds.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the three friends:
\[ 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends:
\[ \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the average weight of the three friends is \(\boxed{180}\) pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the angle of the sun from the ground after it has moved for 10 hours, given that it starts at the tip of the pyramid and moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.

1. **Initial Angle of the Sun**: The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground.

2. **Rate of Movement**: The sun moves at 5 degrees per hour.

3. **Time of Movement**: The sun moves for 10 hours.

4. **Total Movement of the Sun**: The total movement of the sun in 10 hours is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Total movement} = 5 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 50 \, \text{degrees}
   \]

5. **Final Angle of the Sun**: The final angle of the sun from the ground is the initial angle plus the total movement:
   \[
   \text{Final angle} = 32 \, \text{degrees} + 50 \, \text{degrees} = 82 \, \text{degrees}
   \]

Therefore, the final angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is **82 degrees**."

"First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night and there are 7 nights in a week, the total reading time in the first week is:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Given that she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she read per minute by dividing 2 pages by 1.5 minutes:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages she read in the first week by multiplying the total reading time by the reading rate:

\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages she read in two weeks is:

\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

So, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

\[ \boxed{240} \]"

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

Given:
- Shiloh's current age, \( S = 44 \).
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( 44 + 7 = 51 \).

Let's denote the nephew's age in 7 years as \( N + 7 \).

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age:
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Now, solve for \( N \):
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"Given that Richie scored 80 goals, we can determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna based on the information provided.

1. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark:
   \[
   \text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60
   \]

2. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna:
   \[
   \text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35
   \]

Now, we sum the goals scored by all three teenagers:
\[
\text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175

"First, let's determine how much money Peter spends each day from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spends an equal amount each day and he has $70 for the week, we can divide $70 by 7 days to find out how much he spends per day:

\[ \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day} \]

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spends money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. So, for each of these 4 days, he spends $10. The cost of the wooden action figures he buys each day is:

\[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ wooden action figures per day} \]

Therefore, over 4 days, he buys:

\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ wooden action figures} \]

After these 4 days, the amount of money he has left is:

\[ 70 - (10 \times 4) = 70 - 40 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

For the remaining 3 days (Thursday through Saturday), he buys plastic action figures which cost $2 each. The number of plastic action figures he can buy each day is:

\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ plastic action figures per day} \]

Therefore, over 3 days, he buys:

\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ plastic action figures} \]

Adding the wooden and plastic action figures together, the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is:

\[ 8 + 15 = 23 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops each week:

- First flower shop: 20 roses
- Second flower shop: 15 roses
- Third flower shop: 30 roses

Total roses supplied per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Ford grows 40 roses every week. Therefore, the number of roses he lacks each week to supply all the flower shops is:

65 (needed) - 40 (grown) = 25 roses

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month is:

25 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 100 roses

Therefore, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To determine how much money Katina will have in her savings account after 2 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money removed from the account over 2 years.
2. Subtract this total from the initial amount in the account.

First, we calculate the total amount removed over 2 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, 2 years would be 24 months. Katina removes $100 each month, so over 24 months, she will remove:
\[ 100 \times 24 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Kate can make is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's calculate the area of Michael's bedroom:
\[ \text{Area} = 18 \, \text{feet} \times 12 \, \text{feet} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the new carpet and padding:
\[ \text{Cost of carpet and padding} = (12 \, \text{dollars/square foot} + 2 \, \text{dollars/square foot}) \times 216 \, \text{square feet} = 14 \, \text{dollars/square foot} \times 216 \, \text{square feet} = 3024 \, \text{dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of removing old carpet} = 4 \, \text{dollars/square foot} \times 216 \, \text{square feet} = 864 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of installing new carpet} = 34 \, \text{dollars/square foot} \times 216 \, \text{square feet} = 7344 \, \text{dollars} \]

Adding all these costs together gives the total cost:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Diane starts with a number, which is 20.
2. She adds half of this number to it. Half of 20 is 10, so we add 10 to 20, which gives us 30.
3. This resulting value (30) is then divided by 5. So, \(30 \div 5 = 6\).
4. Next, this value (6) is multiplied by the starting value minus 12. The starting value is 20, so 20 minus 12 is 8. Therefore, we multiply 6 by 8, which gives us \(6 \times 8 = 48\).

So, the final value of the number train is \(\boxed{48}\)."

"First, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off. The actual temperature is 468 when she sets it to 450. The difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage by which the oven is off is calculated as follows:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is 4% too hot. To find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to in order to achieve a target temperature of 520 degrees, we need to find the temperature \( T \) such that the oven will read 520 degrees but actually be 4% higher. Therefore, we set up the equation:

\[ T \times 1.04 = 520 \]

Solving for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees to achieve a target temperature of 520 degrees. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{500} \]"
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

1. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - So, 1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 + 30 = 90 minutes

2. The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long.
   - 2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
   - So, 2 hours and 5 minutes = 120 + 5 = 125 minutes

Now, we add the durations of the two movies together:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to determine how much less it is compared to Herb's house. Since Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, we calculate 30% of $76,000.

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 76,000 = 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

So, Juan's house is worth $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

Now, we add the value of both houses to find the combined value:

\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is \(\boxed{129200}\)."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Judy bought a dozen cups. A dozen is 12, so Judy bought 12 cups.
2. Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups. Therefore, she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.
3. Judy's friend brought 40 cups.
4. Judy's friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend:

- Total cups brought by Judy and her friend: \(12 + 40 = 52\)
- Total dishes brought by Judy and her friend: \(24 + 44 = 68\)

Adding the total number of cups and dishes together gives us the total number of utensils:

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount.

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

Since the question asks for the cost per pair of contacts and we have 180 individual contacts, we need to determine how many pairs that is. There are 90 pairs in 180 contacts.

The cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \]

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \boxed{2.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours worked by Jill and John.

Jill worked:
- 2 hours on Saturday
- 1 hour on Sunday
Total hours for Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

John worked:
- Twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday
- Three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday
Total hours for John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours

Next, we calculate the earnings for each person. Since they are paid $10 per hour:

Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30
John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:

Difference in earnings = John's earnings - Jill's earnings
Difference in earnings = $70 - $30 = $40

John earned $40 more than Jill.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
$40"

"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. Therefore, we can express the number of red and green jelly beans in terms of \( B \):

- Number of red jelly beans = \( B - 0.01B = 0.99B \)
- Number of green jelly beans = \( B + 0.01B = 1.01B \)

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. So, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

- Number of red jelly beans = \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Number of green jelly beans = \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:

\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains \(\boxed{30}\) more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."

   - Martin loses 1.25 pounds per week.
   - Over 5 weeks, the total weight loss is \(1.25 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 6.25 \, \text{pounds}\).

2. **Weight change from eating donuts:**
   - Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week.
   - Over 5 weeks, the total weight gain is \(1.75 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 8.75 \, \text{pounds}\).

3. **Difference in weight change:**
   - The difference in weight change between eating donuts and Cheerios is \(8.75 \, \text{pounds} - (-6.25 \, \text{pounds}) = 8.75 \, \text{pounds} + 6.25 \, \text{pounds} = 15 \, \text{pounds}\).

Therefore, at the end of 5 weeks, Martin will be 15 pounds heavier if he eats donuts for breakfast compared to eating Cheerios."
"First, let's calculate the number of people invited via email and their friends. Alex initially invites 100 people via email, and each of these 100 people will invite 2 friends. Therefore, the total number of additional people invited by email is:

\[ 100 \times 2 = 200 \]

Adding the initial 100 people, the total number of people from the email invitations is:

\[ 100 + 200 = 300 \]

Next, Alex calls 10 of her friends and invites them. Out of these 10 friends, 8 will bring their spouses. Therefore, the total number of people from the phone invitations is:

\[ 10 + 8 = 18 \]

Now, we add the number of people from the email invitations and the phone invitations to find the total number of people Alex needs to accommodate:

\[ 300 + 18 = 318 \]

Therefore, Alex will need \(\boxed{318}\) seats."
"The Affenpinscher weighed 10 pounds.

The Dachshund weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so:
\[ \text{Dachshund's weight} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ pounds} \]

The Papillon weighed one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so:
\[ \text{Papillon's weight} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

The Mastiff weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so:
\[ \text{Mastiff's weight} = 44 \times 5 = 220 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the Mastiff weighed 220 pounds."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the boots on Amazon.com:
- Cost of boots: $16
- Shipping cost: $4
- Total cost on Amazon: $16 + $4 = $20

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the boots on eBay:
- Cost of boots: $13
- Shipping cost: Twice the cost of Amazon's shipping, so $4 * 2 = $8
- Total cost on eBay: $13 + $8 = $21

Now, we need to find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon:
- Difference in cost: $21 (eBay) - $20 (Amazon) = $1

The boots work out to be $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we need to calculate the height of the beanstalk each day until it exceeds 20 feet. The beanstalk starts at 4 feet and doubles in height every day.

Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk day by day:

- **Day 0**: 4 feet
- **Day 1**: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) feet
- **Day 2**: \(8 \times 2 = 16\) feet
- **Day 3**: \(16 \times 2 = 32\) feet

On Day 3, the beanstalk reaches 32 feet, which is taller than the 20 feet of the window.

Therefore, it takes \(\boxed{3}\) days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window."
"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Determine how much protein John consumes in a week.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms (which is double the amount of 100 grams) will contain double the amount of protein:
\[ 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} \times \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

Next, we need to find out how much protein John consumes in a week. Since he eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ 6 \text{ grams of protein/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein/week} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 42 \text{ grams of protein per week} \]"
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
Subtract \( J \) from both sides:
\[ 0 = J - 10 \]
Add 10 to both sides:
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

1. The base price for 2 implants is \(2 \times \$2000 = \$4000\).
2. The additional cost for the porcelain crown is \$500.
3. Therefore, the total cost is \( \$4000 + \$500 = \$4500 \).

George has already paid a deposit of \$600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ \$4500 - \$600 = \$3900 \]

George earns \$15 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn \$3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{\$3900}{\$15 \text{ per hour}} = 260 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = 30 \]

Now, we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Colby has in each type of coin:

- Quarters: 8 quarters × $0.25 = $2.00
- Dimes: 6 dimes × $0.10 = $0.60
- Nickels: 14 nickels × $0.05 = $0.70
- Pennies: 15 pennies × $0.01 = $0.15

Now, let's add up all the money Colby has:

$2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45

Since each gumball costs a nickel ($0.05), we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:

$3.45 ÷ $0.05 = 69

Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"To determine the total number of legs the pets in the store have, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then sum them up.

1. **Dogs**: Each dog has 4 legs. There are 5 dogs.
   \[
   5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 20 \text{ legs}
   \]

2. **Cats**: Each cat has 4 legs. There are 2 cats.
   \[
   2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs per cat} = 8 \text{ legs}
   \]

3. **Birds**: Each bird has 2 legs. There are 10 birds.
   \[
   10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs per bird} = 20 \text{ legs}
   \]

Now, we add up all the legs:
\[
20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}
\]

**Final Answer:**

"First, we need to determine the speed of the plane. The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. Therefore, the speed of the plane is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. Using the formula for time, which is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

we substitute the distance (2000 miles) and the speed (400 miles per hour):

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolate Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ \text{Pounds Ruiz makes per hour} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds as Ruiz in one hour:

\[ \text{Pounds Marissa makes per hour} = 60 \times \frac{3}{4} = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we find out how many pounds each of them can make in 12 hours. For Ruiz:

\[ \text{Pounds Ruiz makes in 12 hours} = 60 \times 12 = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

For Marissa:

\[ \text{Pounds Marissa makes in 12 hours} = 45 \times 12 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the amounts together to find the total pounds of chocolate they made together:

\[ \text{Total pounds of chocolate} = 720 + 540 = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

\[ \boxed{1260} \]"

- On Monday, Howard spends $8.
- On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as on Tuesday, which is \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Next, we add up the total amount spent over the three days:
\[ 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \]

Howard originally had $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the total amount spent from his original amount:
\[ 100 - 88 = 12 \]

Therefore, Howard has \(\boxed{12}\) dollars left."
"First, let's calculate the earnings from the first four hours:

- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup.
- Earnings per hour = 15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour.
- Total earnings for 4 hours = $7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30.

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the next two hours:

- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
- Earnings per hour = 10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6.00/hour.
- Total earnings for 2 hours = $6.00/hour * 2 hours = $12.

Finally, let's add the earnings from both periods to find the total earnings:

- Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42.

Therefore, Patrick earned a total of $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of rotations per month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
   - For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
   - Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
     \[
     \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/rotation cycle}} \times 725 \text{ rotations/cycle} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of rotations per year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of rotations per year is:
     \[
     145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced:**
   - Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.
   - The number of years before the tire needs to be replaced is:
     \[
     \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years}

Therefore, the tire needs to be replaced after \(\boxed{6}\) years."
"First, we need to determine the total number of washings provided by the jumbo bottle of shampoo. According to the directions, 2 pumps of shampoo give 120 washings. 

If Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, then each wash uses half the amount of shampoo that 2 pumps would use. Therefore, the number of washings per pump is:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump} \]

Next, we need to find out how much each washing costs. The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, the cost per washing is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \]

Since each pump provides enough shampoo for 60 washings, the cost per pump is:
\[ 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \times 60 \text{ washings per pump} = 12 \text{ cents per pump} \]

Therefore, the cost per pump is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"

1. Calculate the amount of butter needed for one dozen croissants.
2. Determine the total number of dozens Juan plans to make in a week.
3. Calculate the total amount of butter needed for the week.

Step 1: Butter needed for one dozen croissants
- It takes \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants.

Step 2: Total number of dozens Juan plans to make in a week
- Juan plans to make 4 dozen croissants a day.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Therefore, the total number of dozens in a week is \(4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen}\).

Step 3: Total amount of butter needed for the week
- Since 1 dozen croissants requires \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter, 28 dozen croissants will require \(28 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7\) pounds of butter.

Therefore, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make the croissants for a week."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we need to calculate the cost of repaving each street and then find the difference.

First, calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:
- Monica's street is 150 meters long.
- The cost per meter is $194.

\[
\text{Cost for Monica's street} = 150 \, \text{meters} \times 194 \, \text{\$/meter} = 29100 \, \text{\$}
\]

Next, calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:
- Lewis' street is 490 meters long.
- The cost per meter is $194.

\[
\text{Cost for Lewis' street} = 490 \, \text{meters} \times 194 \, \text{\$/meter} = 95060 \, \text{\$}
\]

Now, find the difference in cost between Lewis' street and Monica's street:

\[
\text{Difference in cost} = 95060 \, \text{\$} - 29100 \, \text{\$} = 65960 \, \text{\$}
\]

Therefore, it costs $65960 more to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street."
"First, let's break down the costs:

1. **Initial 5 months:**
   - Funding per month: $100,000
   - Total for 5 months: \( 5 \times 100,000 = 500,000 \)

2. **Remaining 5 months:**
   - The research took 10 times the initial 5 months, so the remaining time is \( 10 \times 5 - 5 = 45 \) months.
   - Each of these months costs 50% more than the previous month's cost.
   - The cost for the 6th month is \( 100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000 \).
   - The cost for the 7th month is \( 150,000 \times 1.5 = 225,000 \).
   - This pattern continues, with each month's cost being 1.5 times the previous month's cost.

The cost for each month can be represented as a geometric series where the first term \( a = 150,000 \) and the common ratio \( r = 1.5 \).

The sum of the first \( n \) terms of a geometric series is given by:
\[ S_n = a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1} \]

Here, \( n = 45 \), \( a = 150,000 \), and \( r = 1.5 \).

\[ S_{45} = 150,000 \frac{1.5^{45} - 1}{1.5 - 1} \]
\[ S_{45} = 150,000 \frac{1.5^{45} - 1}{0.5} \]
\[ S_{45} = 300,000 (1.5^{45} - 1) \]

Now, we need to calculate \( 1.5^{45} \):

Using a calculator:
\[ 1.5^{45} \approx 1,148,698.13 \]

So,
\[ S_{45} = 300,000 (1,148,698.13 - 1) \]
\[ S_{45} = 300,000 \times 1,148,697.13 \]
\[ S_{45} \approx 344,609,139 \]

Finally, adding the initial 5 months' cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 500,000 + 344,609,139 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} \approx 345,109,139 \]

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is approximately $345,109,139."
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the basketball team, we need to add up the ounces of meat each player ate.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that's \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, we add up the ounces of meat:
\[ 6 \text{ ounces} + 8 \text{ ounces} + 16 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is:
\[ 30 \]"
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to follow these steps:

"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks.
2. Each week, he went twice for 2 hours at a time.
3. The cost of the sessions is $125 per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total number of hours John spent in physical therapy:

- Each session is 2 hours long.
- He went twice a week, so each week he spent \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours in therapy.
- Over 6 weeks, he spent \(4 \times 6 = 24\) hours in therapy.

Next, we calculate the total cost:

- The cost per hour is $125.
- Therefore, the total cost for 24 hours is \(24 \times 125 = 3000\).

So, the total cost of the physical therapy is \(\boxed{3000}\)."
"First, let's break down Jim's gum usage throughout the day:

1. **At school:**
   - Jim is at school for 8 hours.

   - Therefore, he chews \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) pieces of gum at school.

2. **On the way home:**
   - He chews 1 piece of gum on the way home.

3. **After dinner:**
   - He chews 1 piece of gum after dinner.

4. **Total pieces chewed before giving to his sister:**
   - Pieces chewed at school: 4
   - Pieces chewed on the way home: 1
   - Pieces chewed after dinner: 1
   - Total pieces chewed: \( 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 \)

5. **Remaining pieces of gum before giving to his sister:**
   - Initial pack: 20 pieces
   - Pieces chewed: 6
   - Remaining pieces: \( 20 - 6 = 14 \)

6. **Giving half to his sister:**
   - He gives half of the remaining 14 pieces to his sister.
   - Pieces given to his sister: \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \)
   - Remaining pieces after giving to his sister: \( 14 - 7 = 7 \)

Therefore, at the end of the day, Jim has \(\boxed{7}\) pieces of gum left."

"First, let's calculate the total amount spent by the baseball coach:
- The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs at $3 each.
- Total cost for baseballs = 9 * $3 = $27.

Next, let's calculate the total amount spent by the basketball coach:
- The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs at $14 each.
- Total cost for basketballs = 8 * $14 = $112.

Now, we need to find out how much more the basketball coach spent compared to the baseball coach:
- Difference in spending = Total cost for basketballs - Total cost for baseballs
- Difference = $112 - $27 = $85.

The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"First, calculate the total number of flowers planted in Arianna's garden:

\[ 10 \text{ rows} \times 20 \text{ flowers per row} = 200 \text{ flowers} \]

Next, determine how many of these flowers have bloomed. Since \( \frac{4}{5} \) of the flowers have bloomed:

\[ \frac{4}{5} \times 200 = \frac{4 \times 200}{5} = \frac{800}{5} = 160 \]

So, the number of flowers that have bloomed is:

\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb/s to Mb/s.
2. Convert the speed from Mb/s to Mb/h.

**Step 1: Convert kb/s to Mb/s**

Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can convert 20 kb/s to Mb/s by dividing by 1000:
\[ 20 \, \text{kb/s} = \frac{20}{1000} \, \text{Mb/s} = 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \]

**Step 2: Convert Mb/s to Mb/h**

There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply the speed in Mb/s by 3600 to get the speed in Mb/h:
\[ 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \times 3600 \, \text{s/h} = 72 \, \text{Mb/h} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. So, for the first three days, the total number of cars towed is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars than it did on the first three days. Therefore, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
for each of the remaining four days. So, for the last four days, the total number of cars towed is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Adding the number of cars towed over the entire week, we get:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

Therefore, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[ 54 \]"
"First, we need to convert Adam's height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide Adam's height by 12:

\[ \text{Adam's height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more Adam needs to grow to reach the required height of 4 feet:

\[ \text{Height needed} = 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:

\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, we calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet:

\[ \text{Years needed} = \frac{\frac{2}{3} \text{ feet}}{\frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year}} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, Adam will need to wait 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the cars. James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.

\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

Next, we need to determine the total cost to the company for acquiring these cars. The company paid 30% of the price of each car.

\[ \text{Cost per car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000 \]

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

\[ \text{Profit} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profit.

\[ \text{Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

Therefore, the amount James made is:

\[ \boxed{17500} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate:

\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \]

So, 25 riders can stay upright.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are men. We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, which means 40% are men. Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is:

\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Given:
- The price of a diamond Jewell is $2000.
- The price of a gold Jewell is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond Jewell.
- The price of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of a gold Jewell.

First, calculate the price of the gold Jewell:
\[
\text{Price of gold Jewell} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
\]

Next, calculate the price of the silver Jewell:
\[
\text{Price of silver Jewell} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, find the total price for all three jewels:
\[
\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

The total price for all three jewels is \(\boxed{4800}\)."
"Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought:
\[ 16 + 3 = 19 \text{ truck stamps} \]

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought:
\[ 19 - 9 = 10 \text{ rose stamps} \]

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of each type of stamp:
\[ 16 \text{ (snowflake)} + 19 \text{ (truck)} + 10 \text{ (rose)} = 45 \]

Therefore, Max bought a total of 45 stamps."
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob. 

1. **Calculate the relative speed:**
   - Bob's speed: 55 miles per hour
   - Tom's speed: 70 miles per hour
   - Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed = 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

2. **Determine the time to close the gap:**
   - Initial distance between Bob and Tom: 75 miles
   - Time = Distance / Relative Speed = 75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"First, we determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we calculate:

\[ \text{Fish caught by Darren} = 17 - 6 = 11 \]

\[ \text{Fish caught by Tommy} = 11 + 3 = 14 \]

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish."
"First, let's determine the cost per class based on the total cost and the number of classes.

The total cost for the classes is $60, and there are 10 classes in total. So, the cost per class is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\$60}{10 \text{ classes}} = \$6 \text{ per class} \]

Since the cost per class is $6, which is less than $10, Manny's parents will still sign him up for the classes even if he misses some. However, we need to find out how many classes he can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as \( x \). If he misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class in this scenario would be:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\$60}{10 - x} \]

We need to find the maximum \( x \) such that the cost per class does not exceed $10:
\[ \frac{\$60}{10 - x} \leq \$10 \]

Solving the inequality:
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of customers Julie processes daily. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, and Jewel processes 50 customers daily, Julie processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers daily.

Next, we calculate the total number of customers each processes in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week:

- Jewel processes \(50 \times 7 = 350\) customers weekly.
- Julie processes \(100 \times 7 = 700\) customers weekly.

Adding these together gives the total weekly production for the two:

\[350 + 700 = 1050\]

Therefore, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel is 1050 customers."

"First, let's determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

The cost of four apples is $5.20. Therefore, the cost of one apple is:
\[ \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]

The cost of three oranges is $3.30. Therefore, the cost of one orange is:
\[ \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]

Now, we need to find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges. The cost for 5 apples is:
\[ 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]

The cost for 5 oranges is:
\[ 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost:
\[ 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, Clyde will pay \(\boxed{12.00}\) for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it will take Bob to shovel out this volume of earth. If it takes him 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, then for 72 cubic feet, the time \( T \) required is:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

Therefore, the time it will take Bob to dig the hole is:

First, let's calculate the distance Alisa biked:
- Alisa's speed: 12 miles per hour
- Alisa's time: 4.5 hours

Using the formula for distance, \( \text{distance} = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \):
\[ \text{Distance Alisa biked} = 12 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4.5 \, \text{hours} = 54 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Stanley biked:
- Stanley's speed: 10 miles per hour
- Stanley's time: 2.5 hours

Using the same formula for distance:
\[ \text{Distance Stanley biked} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2.5 \, \text{hours} = 25 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we sum the distances biked by Alisa and Stanley:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 54 \, \text{miles} + 25 \, \text{miles} = 79 \, \text{miles} \]

"First, let's determine the amount Ariadne earned from selling green hats in the first month. According to the problem, the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month were:

\[ 400 \times 2 = 800 \]

So, the total sales in the first month were:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

In the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month. Therefore, the sales in the second month were:

\[ 1200 \times \frac{3}{4} = 900 \]

To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the sales from the first month and the second month:

So, Mike will finish his reading in 20 days. Since the assignment is due in 30 days, we can calculate how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading:

\[ 30 \text{ days} - 20 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ days} \]

Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline."
"First, let's break down the costs:

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane:**
   - The plane costs $150,000.

2. **Monthly Hanger Rental:**
   - James pays $5,000 per month for the hanger.

3. **Monthly Fuel Cost:**
   - The fuel cost is twice the hanger rental, so it is \(2 \times 5,000 = 10,000\) dollars per month.

Next, we calculate the total monthly cost for maintaining the plane:
\[ \text{Total Monthly Cost} = \text{Hanger Rental} + \text{Fuel Cost} = 5,000 + 10,000 = 15,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the first year (12 months):
\[ \text{Total Annual Cost} = \text{Total Monthly Cost} \times 12 = 15,000 \times 12 = 180,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the total annual maintenance cost:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Initial Cost} + \text{Total Annual Cost} = 150,000 + 180,000 = 330,000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is:
\[ \boxed{330000} \]"
"Given:
- Time to cook rice = 30 minutes
- Time to cook pork = Time to cook rice + 20 minutes
- Time to cook beans = 0.5 * (Time to cook pork + Time to cook rice)

First, calculate the time to cook pork:
\[ \text{Time to cook pork} = 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, calculate the time to cook beans:
\[ \text{Time to cook beans} = 0.5 \times (50 + 30) = 0.5 \times 80 = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, sum the cooking times for all the food:
\[ \text{Total cooking time} = \text{Time to cook rice} + \text{Time to cook pork} + \text{Time to cook beans} \]
\[ \text{Total cooking time} = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

The total time to cook all the food is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts).

- Cost of 1/2 pound almonds: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5\) dollars
- Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars
- Total cost of the first mixture: \(5 + 5 = 10\) dollars

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts).

- Cost of 1/5 pound almonds: \(\frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2\) dollars
- Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars
- Total cost of the second mixture: \(2 + 5 = 7\) dollars

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures.

- Difference in cost: \(10 - 7 = 3\) dollars

Therefore, the first mixture costs $3 more than the second mixture."
"Let's define the variables:
- Let \( S \) be the number of sheep.
- Let \( G \) be the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:
1. The total number of heads is 20:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]
2. The total number of legs is 70:
   \[
   4S + 2G = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[
2S + G = 35
\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
S + G = 20 \\
2S + G = 35
\end{cases}
\]

To solve for \( S \) and \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20
\]
\[
S = 15
\]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( \boxed{15} \)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The original brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more.

\[ \text{Cost increase} = 5 \times 0.20 = 1 \]

So, the cost of the more expensive brand is:

\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, which is 7 pounds (since he uses 1 pound per day).

\[ \text{Cost of coffee for a week} = 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

He also buys a donut for $2.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 42 + 2 = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought, excluding the apple pie.

1. Cost of 2 bags of chips: \(2 \times \$2.00 = \$4.00\)
2. Cost of the bucket of fried chicken: \$8.00
3. Cost of the bottle of soda: \$1.00

Adding these amounts together:
\[ \$4.00 + \$8.00 + \$1.00 = \$13.00 \]

Gus spent a total of \$20.00 at the grocery store. To find the cost of the apple pie, we subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount spent:
\[ \$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00 \]

Therefore, the apple pie cost \(\$7.00\)."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

Total newspapers delivered in a day = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers - (Newspapers to District A + Newspapers to District C)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - (198 + 209)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 407
Newspapers delivered to District B = 193

James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John spends in the cooking class.

- The class meets 4 times a week.
- Each session is 2 hours long.
- The class runs for 6 weeks.

So, the total number of hours spent in the class is:
\[ 4 \text{ sessions/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/session} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to determine how many recipes John learns. He learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. Therefore, we divide the total hours by 1.5 to find the number of recipes:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ hours}}{1.5 \text{ hours/recipe}} = 32 \text{ recipes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the number of history teachers on the basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

This means there are 90 history teachers. Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

So, there are 60 math teachers. Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

Thus, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is \(\boxed{360}\) hours."
"First, let's determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[
\text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we find out how much money Rayna has. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so:

\[
\text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add together the money that Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia have:

\[
\text{Total money} = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360 \text{ dollars}
\]

To find out how much each person would have if they shared the total money equally, we divide the total money by 3:

\[
\text{Money per person} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, if they decided to add together their money and share equally, each would have \(\boxed{120}\) dollars."
"The game originally consists of 4 quarters, each 12 minutes long. So, the total time for the 4 quarters is:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there was a tie in the last quarter and the game was extended for an additional 5 minutes, we add these 5 minutes to the original 48 minutes:

\[ 48 + 5 = 53 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the entire game lasted:

\[ 53 \text{ minutes} \]"
"First, calculate the number of employees who are management. Since 20% of the 50 employees are management, we calculate:

"Christina had a total of 30 days of mood records. She had:
- 12 good days
- 8 bad days
- The rest were neutral

First, we calculate the number of neutral days:
\[ 30 - 12 - 8 = 10 \text{ neutral days} \]

According to the given pattern:
- The first 8 days were good
- The next 8 days were bad
- The following 8 days were neutral

This means the first 24 days were:
- 8 good days
- 8 bad days
- 8 neutral days

Now, we account for the next 3 days:
- 1 good day
- 1 neutral day
- 1 good day

Adding these to the previous counts:
- Good days: \(8 + 1 + 1 = 10\)
- Neutral days: \(8 + 1 = 9\)

The total number of good days in the month is:
\[ 10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To find the value of \( S \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

Sally has 9 books."
"First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the current height of 20 feet is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The target height is 600 inches. Therefore, the bamboo needs to grow:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

Given that the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, the number of days required to grow 360 inches is:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach 600 inches in height.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - James needs to buy 8 more toys to cover the additional 8 dogs.

2. **After Buying the Toys:**
   - James now has \(4 + 8 = 12\) toys for 12 dogs.
   - The number of dogs doubles, so there are now \(12 \times 2 = 24\) dogs.
   - James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys.

3. **After Buying More Toys:**
   - James now has \(12 + 12 = 24\) toys for 24 dogs.
   - 3 dogs leave the shelter, so the number of dogs is now \(24 - 3 = 21\).
   - James no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs that left.

4. **Total Number of Toys Needed:**
   - Initially, James needed 12 toys.
   - Then he needed 12 more toys.
   - The total number of toys he needs is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is \(\boxed{24}\)."
"First, let's determine how much Dylan invested. Dylan's investment is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total amount of $1200.

1. **Katarina's Cookies:**
   Katarina has 68 cookies.

2. **Max's Cookies:**
   Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max. Therefore, Max has:
   \[
   68 + 5 = 73 \text{ cookies}
   \]

3. **Cookie Monster's Cookies:**
   Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. Therefore, the Cookie Monster has:

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds 20 cm of lace trim to make the final dress 140 cm long. This can be expressed with the following equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was \( 80 \) cm.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow the entire lawn when he uses both ""turtle"" and ""rabbit"" modes.

First, let's find the mowing rates for both modes:
- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour, which is 60 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""turtle"" mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} \).
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""rabbit"" mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} \).

Next, we calculate the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode:
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes} \).
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes} \).

Finally, we add the times for both halves to find the total time:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the entire lawn."

"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- Let \( T_1 \) be the age of one of the twins.
- Let \( T_2 \) be the age of the other twin.
- Let \( P_1 \) be the age of one of the triplets.
- Let \( P_2 \) and \( P_3 \) be the ages of the other two triplets.

Given that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write:
\[ T_1 = P_1 + 7 \]

The combined ages of all four individuals are 44, so we can write:
\[ T_1 + T_2 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]

Since the triplets are the same age, we can simplify the equation to:
\[ T_1 + T_2 + P_1 + 2P_1 = 44 \]
\[ T_1 + T_2 + 3P_1 = 44 \]

We also know that \( T_1 = P_1 + 7 \). Substituting \( T_1 \) in the equation, we get:
\[ (P_1 + 7) + T_2 + 3P_1 = 44 \]
\[ 4P_1 + 7 + T_2 = 44 \]
\[ 4P_1 + T_2 = 37 \]

Since \( T_2 \) is the age of the other twin, and the twins are the same age, \( T_2 = T_1 \). Therefore, we can substitute \( T_2 \) with \( T_1 \):
\[ 4P_1 + T_1 = 37 \]

We already know \( T_1 = P_1 + 7 \), so substituting \( T_1 \) in the equation, we get:
\[ 4P_1 + (P_1 + 7) = 37 \]
\[ 5P_1 + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 5P_1 = 30 \]
\[ P_1 = 6 \]

Now, we can find \( T_1 \):
\[ T_1 = P_1 + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13 \]

Therefore, the age of one of the twins is:
\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends on his homework:

- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Converting 3 hours into minutes:

3 hours = 3 × 60 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, we subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner to find out how much time John has left for a nap:

Time for nap = Total time before dinner - Time spent on homework
Time for nap = 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the candies. We know that four candies cost $3.20, so the cost of one candy is:

\[ \text{Cost of one candy} = \frac{3.20}{4} = 0.80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 candies:

\[ \text{Cost of 10 candies} = 10 \times 0.80 = 8.00 \]

Now, we know that each lollipop costs $0.40. Therefore, the cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ \text{Cost of 10 lollipops} = 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the 10 lollipops and the 10 candies to find the total cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8.00 + 4.00 = 12.00 \]

So, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"
"First, let's determine how many coins Neil saves each month. Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong. Since Rong saves 20 coins each month, Neil saves:

\[ 20 + \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each person has saved over ten years. There are 120 months in ten years (since \( 10 \times 12 = 120 \)).

For Rong:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Therefore, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:
\[ \boxed{5760} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Each vaccine costs $20, and the dog needs 2 vaccines:

\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Next, let's denote the cost of the heartworm check as \( x \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:

\[ \text{Total bill} = 40 + x \]

Since the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, we can write:

\[ x = 0.60 \times (40 + x) \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ x = 0.60 \times (40 + x) \]
\[ x = 24 + 0.60x \]
\[ x - 0.60x = 24 \]
\[ 0.40x = 24 \]
\[ x = \frac{24}{0.40} \]
\[ x = 60 \]

So, the cost of the heartworm check is $60. Now, we can find the total bill:

\[ \text{Total bill} = 40 + 60 = 100 \]

John brought $125 with him. After paying the total bill of $100, the amount he leaves with is:

\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - Therefore, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in a crate.
   - The total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in a crate.
   - The total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - Oranges cost three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1.
   - Therefore, one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in a crate.
   - The total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

4. **Total Cost of the Crate:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges.
   - Total cost = Cost of bananas + Cost of apples + Cost of oranges
   - Total cost = \(5 + 6 + 21 = 32\) dollars.

The price for such a crate of fruit is \(\boxed{32}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine the number of each type of square:

1. **Red squares**: There are 14 red squares.
2. **Blue squares**: There are 4 more blue squares than red squares. So, the number of blue squares is:
   \[
   14 + 4 = 18
   \]
3. **Green squares**: There are 6 more green squares than blue squares. So, the number of green squares is:
   \[
   18 + 6 = 24
   \]
4. **White squares**: There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. So, the number of white squares is:
   \[
   24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Next, we sum the number of all the squares to find the total number of squares in the comforter:
\[
14 \text{ (red)} + 18 \text{ (blue)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 12 \text{ (white)} = 68
\]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares. Therefore, the total area of the comforter is:
\[
68 \text{ square feet}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{68}

"First, let's determine the number of regular chairs Mia's restaurant currently has. According to the problem, the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Given that there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs is:

\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of chairs currently available in the restaurant:

\[ 40 \text{ (regular chairs)} + 8 \text{ (high chairs)} = 48 \text{ chairs} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs needed for the function. There will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending, so the total number of chairs required is:

\[ 42 + 15 = 57 \]

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the number of chairs currently available from the number of chairs needed:

\[ 57 - 48 = 9 \]

Therefore, Mia needs to get \(\boxed{9}\) more chairs."
"First, we calculate the number of bucks in the field. Since 50 percent of the 50 deer are bucks, we have:

\[ 50 \times 0.50 = 25 \text{ bucks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these bucks are 8 points. Since 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points, we calculate:

\[ 25 \times 0.20 = 5 \text{ 8 point bucks} \]

Therefore, the number of 8 point bucks is:

"First, let's calculate the points collected by each student:

1. **Adam's Points**: Adam has 50 points.
2. **Betty's Points**: Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. So, we calculate 30% of Adam's points and add it to Adam's points.
   \[
   \text{Betty's points} = 50 + (0.30 \times 50) = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]
3. **Tom's Points**: Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
   \[
   \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35
   \]
4. **Betty's Points (Recheck)**: We already calculated Betty's points as 65.
5. **Marta's Points**: Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom.
   \[
   \text{Marta's points} = 3 \times 35 = 105
   \]

Now, let's sum up the points collected by all students:
\[
\text{Total points} = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255
\]

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. Therefore, the class is missing:
\[
400 - 255 = 145 \text{ points}

2. Each of these 3 children has 3 children of their own (grandchildren), so the total number of grandchildren is:
   \[
   3 \text{ children} \times 3 \text{ grandchildren per child} = 9 \text{ grandchildren}
   \]
3. Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies of their own (great-grandbabies), so the total number of great-grandbabies is:
   \[
   9 \text{ grandchildren} \times 3 \text{ great-grandbabies per grandchild} = 27 \text{ great-grandbabies}
   \]

Therefore, the number of great-grandbabies at the family reunion is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks set off by the city:

- The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each.
- Total fireworks from the city = \(15 \times 20 = 300\) fireworks.

Next, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard:

- Hannah is setting off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each.
- Total fireworks from Hannah = \(3 \times 5 = 15\) fireworks.

Now, let's find out how many fireworks Hannah will see from the city display:

- Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks.
- Fireworks Hannah sees from the city = \(300 \times 0.40 = 120\) fireworks.

Finally, we add the fireworks Hannah sees from the city to the fireworks she sets off in her backyard to get the total number of fireworks Hannah will see:

- Total fireworks Hannah sees = \(120 + 15 = 135\).

Therefore, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is \(\boxed{135}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person saves a seat and buys enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats. Since each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks, and there are 20 people, the group will buy:

- \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) drinks
- \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) snacks

Each drink and snack costs $2, so the total cost for the drinks is:

\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

And the total cost for the snacks is:

\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount spent on drinks and snacks:

\[ 80 + 120 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ 4,000 \text{ pounds} + 800 \text{ pounds} = 4,800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. We can set up the following equation to find the capacity of Gary's truck:

\[ 4,000 \text{ pounds} + 4,800 \text{ pounds} + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11,600 \text{ pounds} \]

Let \( x \) represent the capacity of Gary's truck. Then we have:

\[ 4,000 + 4,800 + x = 11,600 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 8,800 + x = 11,600 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 8,800 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 11,600 - 8,800 \]
\[ x = 2,800 \]

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry \(\boxed{2800}\) pounds of gravel."
"Each female ate 3 dumplings. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \]

There are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Adding the dumplings eaten by the males and females gives the total number of dumplings cooked:
\[ 32 + 18 = 50 \]

Therefore, Larry cooked 50 dumplings."

"First, we determine the speed of Martha's turtle. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and the cat can run at 15 feet/second, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we calculate how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We use the formula for distance, which is speed multiplied by time.

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the turtle can crawl \(\boxed{120}\) feet in 40 seconds."
"To determine how many additional hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first need to calculate the remaining amount they need to raise. The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. Therefore, the remaining amount is:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much they raise per hour. From the first 3 hours, they raised $2100. So, the amount raised per hour is:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more hours they need to raise the remaining $4200 at a rate of $700 per hour. This can be calculated as:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Therefore, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours. Adding these 6 hours to the initial 3 hours, the total number of hours they need to fundraise is:

\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]

So, the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal is:

"First, let's determine the percentage of the river's water used by Colorado City for industrial purposes. Since the city uses 40% of the river's water and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes, we calculate:

\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 \]

This means 32% of the river's total water is used for industrial purposes by the city.

Next, to find the percentage of the river's water used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial usage from the total usage by the city:

\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

Therefore, 8% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

8%"

"To determine the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we first need to calculate the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream.

1. **Chocolate Ice Cream Production Rate:**
   - The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
   - Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is:
     \[
     \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour}
     \]

2. **Vanilla Ice Cream Production Rate:**
   - The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
   - Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is:
     \[
     \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour}
     \]

3. **Total Production in 48 Hours:**
   - For chocolate ice cream in 48 hours:
     \[
     50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts}
     \]
   - For vanilla ice cream in 48 hours:
     \[
     12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts}
     \]

4. **Total Quarts of Ice Cream:**
   - Adding the quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream:
     \[
     2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts}

"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Marcus ordered:

- Croissants: \(5 \times \$3.00 = \$15.00\)
- Cinnamon rolls: \(4 \times \$2.50 = \$10.00\)
- Mini quiches: \(3 \times \$4.00 = \$12.00\)
- Blueberry muffins: \(13 \times \$1.00 = \$13.00\)

Next, we add these amounts to find the total before the discount:
\[
\$15.00 + \$10.00 + \$12.00 + \$13.00 = \$50.00
\]

Now, we apply the 10% discount:
\[
10\% \text{ of } \$50.00 = 0.10 \times \$50.00 = \$5.00
\]

Subtract the discount from the total:
\[
\$50.00 - \$5.00 = \$45.00

"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can get with $6.00, we need to consider the deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's calculate the cost for 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free):
\[ 2 \text{ scoops} \times \$1.50/\text{scoop} = \$3.00 \]

So, for every $3.00, Erin gets 3 scoops of ice cream.

Now, let's see how many sets of 3 scoops she can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{\$6.00}{\$3.00/\text{set}} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set gives her 3 scoops, 2 sets will give her:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops/set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream with $6.00.

"First, let's calculate how much candy Ginger and Amy eat in two weeks.

- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks, she eats \(4 \times 14 = 56\) pieces.
- Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks, she eats \(3 \times 14 = 42\) pieces.

Now, let's determine how much candy each has left after two weeks.

- Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56 pieces, so she has \(100 - 56 = 44\) pieces left.
- Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42 pieces, so she has \(100 - 42 = 58\) pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger, we subtract the amount of candy Ginger has from the amount Amy has:

\[58 - 44 = 14\]

So, after two weeks, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger.

"First, calculate the area that Mr. Boarden wants to cover, which is two thirds of his 36 square feet bathroom.

\[
\text{Area to cover} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \text{ sq ft} = 24 \text{ sq ft}
\]

Next, since he needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot, we calculate the total number of tiles needed for 24 square feet.

\[
\text{Total tiles needed} = 24 \text{ sq ft} \times 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft} = 576 \text{ tiles}
\]

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 square feet bathroom."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries. The initial cost to go picking is $20, and then there's an additional cost of $1.5 per pound for the 30 pounds James picked.

The cost for the blueberries themselves is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

Adding the initial cost to go picking:
\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost if James had bought the same amount of blueberries at the store. The price at the store is $2.5 per pound, so for 30 pounds, the cost would be:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

Now, to find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking the blueberries from the cost of buying them at the store:
\[ \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \]

So, James saved:

The restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"First, let's determine the total number of pizzas ordered. Since Bryce and his four friends each ordered one pizza, the total number of pizzas is:

\[ 1 + 4 = 5 \]

Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends. Each of these three people ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizza. Therefore, the number of slices each of them ate is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \]

Since there are three people (Bryce and his two friends) who each ate 8 slices, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we calculate the number of slices eaten by the other two friends. Each of these two friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizza. Therefore, the number of slices each of them ate is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \]

Since there are two people who each ate 9 slices, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Adding the slices eaten by all five friends, we get:

\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \]

The total number of slices left is the total number of slices minus the number of slices eaten:

\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \]

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. The dog can eat the sausages in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes. Since the cat takes 30 minutes, the dog takes:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 30 = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the average time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages. The average time is the sum of the times divided by 2:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is:

\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"First, we need to convert the length of one of Topher's shoes into inches. Topher's shoe length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the feet to inches as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Adding the additional 4 inches:

\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. The relationship can be expressed as:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \( 10 \) inches.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars. There are 64 students' cars, each with 4 windows. Since Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of students' cars smashed} = \frac{1}{4} \times 64 = 16
\]

Each of these 16 cars has 4 windows, so the total number of windows smashed from the students' cars is:

\[
16 \times 4 = 64
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars, each with 2 windows. Since Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of teachers' cars smashed} = \frac{3}{4} \times 32 = 24
\]

Each of these 24 cars has 2 windows, so the total number of windows smashed from the teachers' cars is:

\[
24 \times 2 = 48
\]

Adding the windows smashed from both the students' and teachers' cars, we get:

\[
64 + 48 = 112
\]

Therefore, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:

\[
\boxed{112}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of spools Candy has:

- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45
- Light green spools: 40
- Dark green spools: 50

Total number of spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

Next, we calculate the number of blue spools:

- Dark blue spools: 45

Number of blue spools = 45

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{45}{150} \right) \times 100 = 0.3 \times 100 = 30\% \]

Therefore, 30% of Candy's spools are blue."
"At 8:00, 5000 people lined up to vote.

By midday (12:00), \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the people had voted. So, the number of people who had voted by midday is:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000
\]

The number of people remaining after midday is:
\[
5000 - 2000 = 3000
\]

By 16:00, \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the remaining people had voted. So, the number of people who had voted by 16:00 from the remaining 3000 is:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000
\]

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:
\[
3000 - 2000 = 1000
\]

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:
\[

"Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. Over 30 days, he will need:

\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Since each pack contains 15 pieces of gum, the number of packs he will need is:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total number of smores needed:

- Each of the 9 kids wants 2 smores, so the kids will need \(9 \times 2 = 18\) smores.
- Each of the 6 adults will eat 1 smore, so the adults will need \(6 \times 1 = 6\) smores.
- Therefore, the total number of smores needed is \(18 + 6 = 24\) smores.

Next, we need to determine how many graham sleeves are required to make 24 smores. Since each sleeve makes 8 smores:

- The number of sleeves needed is \(\frac{24}{8} = 3\) sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, they will need 1 box of graham crackers.

"First, let's determine Dora's father's age. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate her father's age as follows:

\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we need to find Dora's mother's age. The problem states that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, we can calculate her mother's age as follows:

\[ \text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Now, we need to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother. We do this by adding their individual ages together:

\[ \text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:

\[ \boxed{87} \]"

"First, let's break down the weights of each book:

- Math and science books: 2 pounds each
- French book: 4 pounds
- English book: 3 pounds
- History book: twice the weight of the English book, so \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds

Now, let's calculate the total weight:

- Cindy has 2 math and science books, so the total weight for these is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds.
- The French book weighs 4 pounds.
- The English book weighs 3 pounds.
- The history book weighs 6 pounds.

Adding these together:

\[4 \text{ (math and science)} + 4 \text{ (French)} + 3 \text{ (English)} + 6 \text{ (history)} = 17 \text{ pounds}\]

So, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds."
"Candidate A got 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, candidate A received:
\[ 20\% \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes} \]

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes. Therefore, candidate B received:
\[ 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ votes} \]

The total number of votes is 100. The votes for candidate C can be calculated by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes:
\[ 100 - (20 + 30) = 50 \text{ votes} \]

Thus, candidate C received:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, Beck has:

\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \text{ apples} \]

Next, if Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Boris will have:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \text{ apples} \]

And Beck will have:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \text{ apples} \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this exchange. We do this by subtracting the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris. 

The final numerical answer is:

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice."
"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. According to the problem, a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5, we can set up the following equation to find the cost of a half-gallon jar:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars. Since each gallon jar costs $5, the total cost for 10 gallon jars is:

\[ \text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars. Since each half-gallon jar costs $3, the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:

\[ \text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Finally, we add the two amounts together to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 50 + 48 = 98 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"To determine how many students like to play video games, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total number of students**: 50
2. **Students who like to bake**: 10
3. **Students who like to play basketball**: 5
4. **Students who like to play music**: Twice the number of students who like to play basketball, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\)

Now, we can calculate the number of students who like to play video games by subtracting the number of students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music from the total number of students.

\[
\text{Students who like to play video games} = \text{Total students} - (\text{Students who like to bake} + \text{Students who like to play basketball} + \text{Students who like to play music})
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
\text{Students who like to play video games} = 50 - (10 + 5 + 10) = 50 - 25 = 25
\]

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is \(\boxed{25}\)."

"First, let's break down the trades Lorraine makes.

1. **Small Stickers to Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers.
   - She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.

2. **Large Stickers to Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 40 large stickers.
   - She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = \(0.5 \times 40 = 20\) large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = \(20 \times 3 = 60\) small buttons.

3. **Large Stickers to Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 40 large stickers initially and traded 20 of them, so she has 20 large stickers left.
   - She trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = \(20 \times 3 = 60\) small buttons.

4. **Total Buttons:**
   - From small stickers to large buttons: 27 small buttons.
   - From large stickers to large buttons: 60 small buttons.
   - From large stickers to small buttons: 60 small buttons.
   - Total buttons = \(27 + 60 + 60 = 147\).

Therefore, by the end, Lorraine has \(\boxed{147}\) buttons."

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against the regulation. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. 11 students need size extra-small.
2. Twice as many students need size small as extra-small, so \(2 \times 11 = 22\) students need size small.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so \(22 - 4 = 18\) students need size medium.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\) students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so \(9 + 6 = 15\) students need size extra-large.

Now, let's sum up the number of students for each size:

- Extra-small: 11
- Small: 22
- Medium: 18
- Large: 9
- Extra-large: 15

"First, calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win:
20% of 50 people = 0.20 * 50 = 10 people

Next, find out how many people are left after accounting for those who think horse #2 will win:
50 - 10 = 40 people

Now, calculate the number of people who think horse #7 will win:
60% of the remaining 40 people = 0.60 * 40 = 24 people

Finally, determine how many people think horse #12 will win by subtracting the number of people who think horse #2 or horse #7 will win from the total number of people:
50 - (10 + 24) = 50 - 34 = 16 people

"To find out how many puppies Jana has, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Pomeranians.
2. Use the total number of Pomeranians to find the total number of puppies.

First, we know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. Therefore, the total number of Pomeranians can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Total Pomeranians} = 6 \times 3 = 18
\]

Next, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let \( P \) be the total number of puppies. Then:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times P = 18
\]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation:
\[
P = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27

Therefore, Jayden needs \(\boxed{85}\) more dollars to buy the camera."
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = \frac{7}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 7x = 500 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 7:
\[ x = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases of shingles:
\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Therefore, the third house will need \(\boxed{142.86}\) cases of shingles."

"Let's define the variables for the scores based on the given information:

- Let \( E_e \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( A_e \) be the number of enemies Ava jumps on. According to the problem, \( A_e = E_e + 8 \).
- Let \( E_b \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( A_b \) be the number of berries Ava collects. According to the problem, \( A_b = E_b + 3 \).
- Let \( E_t \) be the time left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.
- Let \( A_t \) be the time left on the timer when Ava finishes the level. According to the problem, \( A_t = E_t + 4 \).

The points for each player can be calculated as follows:
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times \text{number of enemies} \)
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times \text{number of berries} \)
- Points from time: \( 30 \times \text{time left on the timer} \)

So, the total score for Emma is:
\[ \text{Score}_E = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \]

And the total score for Ava is:
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10A_e + 5A_b + 30A_t \]

Substituting the values of \( A_e \), \( A_b \), and \( A_t \) in terms of \( E_e \), \( E_b \), and \( E_t \):
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(E_b + 3) + 30(E_t + 4) \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120 \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215 \]

Now, we can find the difference between their scores:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Score}_A - \text{Score}_E \]
\[ \text{Difference} = (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215) - (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 215 \]

"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish Bob bought as \( W \). Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had \( 3 + O \) orange fish and \( 4 + W \) white fish. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]

Rearranging the terms to isolate \( O \) and \( W \), we get:

\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so:

\[ O + W = 17 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1. \( O - 2W = 5 \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use substitution. From the second equation, we can express \( O \) in terms of \( W \):

\[ O = 17 - W \]

Substitute this expression for \( O \) into the first equation:

\[ 17 - W - 2W = 5 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 17 - 3W = 5 \]

Isolate \( W \):

\[ -3W = 5 - 17 \]
\[ -3W = -12 \]
\[ W = 4 \]

Now substitute \( W = 4 \) back into the equation \( O = 17 - W \):

\[ O = 17 - 4 \]
\[ O = 13 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish and 13 orange fish. The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:

\[
\boxed{4}

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups each brought back 2 seashells. According to the problem, \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the groups brought back seashells. Therefore, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of groups bringing seashells} = \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6
\]

Each of these 6 groups brought back 2 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is:

\[
\text{Total seashells} = 6 \times 2 = 12
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[

"To determine how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily earnings from bottle caps.
2. Multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in the month.

First, we know that Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day and each bottle cap is worth $0.25. Therefore, his daily earnings are:
\[ 10 \text{ bottle caps/day} \times \$0.25/\text{bottle cap} = \$2.50/\text{day} \]

Next, we need to find out how much he earns in a 30-day month. We do this by multiplying his daily earnings by the number of days in the month:
\[ \$2.50/\text{day} \times 30 \text{ days} = \$75.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's calculate Jamie's regular pay for the 8 hours she works each day at her regular hourly rate of $20.

\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$160 \]

Since Jamie worked 11 hours on Tuesday, she worked 3 additional hours beyond her regular 8-hour workday. The special hourly rate for these additional hours is 150% of her regular hourly rate.

\[ 150\% \text{ of } \$20 = 1.5 \times \$20 = \$30/\text{hour} \]

Now, let's calculate the pay for the 3 additional hours.

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$90 \]

Finally, we add the regular pay and the additional pay to find the total amount Jamie was paid for her work on Tuesday.

\[ \$160 + \$90 = \$250 \]

Therefore, Jamie was paid \(\boxed{250}\) dollars for her work on Tuesday."
"The zookeeper counts 12 female lions. There are half as many male lions as female lions, so there are \(12 / 2 = 6\) male lions. Additionally, there are 14 lion cubs. To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, add the number of female lions, male lions, and cubs together:

\[12 + 6 + 14 = 32\]

There are 32 lions in the enclosure."
"First, we need to calculate the discount on the jeans. The original price of the jeans is $40, and they are advertised at 25% off.

To find the discount amount:
\[ \text{Discount} = 40 \times \frac{25}{100} = 40 \times 0.25 = 10 \]

So, the discount is $10. Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:
\[ \text{Sale Price} = 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Mike pays with a $50 bill. To find out how much money he will have left over, we subtract the sale price from the amount he paid:
\[ \text{Change} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Mike will have left over is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"The company hires 20 new employees every month. Over three months, the total number of new hires is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

The initial number of employees is 200. Adding the new hires, the total number of employees after three months is:
\[ 200 \text{ initial employees} + 60 \text{ new employees} = 260 \text{ employees} \]

Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month. Therefore, the total monthly salary for all employees is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1,040,000 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:
\[ 1,040,000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3,120,000 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's determine Billy's hourly wage at each stage of his employment:

1. **Initial wage**: $10 per hour.
2. **After 2 months**: $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.
3. **On his first anniversary**: $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate Billy's earnings for 20 hours of work at his final wage:

\[ 20 \text{ hours} \times \$11.50 \text{ per hour} = \$230 \]

Next, we determine Sally's starting wage. Since Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary:

\[ \$10 + \$0.50 = \$10.50 \text{ per hour} \]

Now, let's calculate Sally's earnings for 20 hours of work at her starting wage:

\[ 20 \text{ hours} \times \$10.50 \text{ per hour} = \$210 \]

Finally, we find the difference in their earnings:

\[ \$230 - \$210 = \$20 \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total current stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the first 2 weeks. She plays for half an hour every day for 14 days (2 weeks).

\[ \text{Hours played in 2 weeks} = 0.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 7 \, \text{hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the following week. She plays for 2 hours every day for 7 days.

\[ \text{Hours played in 1 week} = 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 14 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, let's add the hours played in the 2 weeks and the 1 week to find the total hours played so far.

\[ \text{Total hours played} = 7 \, \text{hours} + 14 \, \text{hours} = 21 \, \text{hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. To find out how many more hours she needs to play, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total required hours.

\[ \text{Hours still needed} = 30 \, \text{hours} - 21 \, \text{hours} = 9 \, \text{hours} \]

Therefore, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. **Distance traveled by the first car:**
   - Speed of the first car: 60 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours

"First, we calculate the total cost of the materials without the premium:

- Cost of the diamond: $600
- Cost of the gold: $300

Total cost of materials = $600 + $300 = $900

Next, we calculate the 30% premium on the total cost of materials:

30% of $900 = 0.30 * $900 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of materials to find the final amount James paid:

Total cost with premium = $900 + $270 = $1170

Therefore, James paid $1170."
"First, let's calculate the pass rates for each grade.

For third graders:
- Number of students: 500
- Number of students who passed: 340
- Pass rate = \(\frac{340}{500} = 0.68\) or 68%

For fourth graders:
- Number of students: 100
- Number of students who passed: 40
- Pass rate = \(\frac{40}{100} = 0.40\) or 40%

For fifth graders:
- The pass rate is twice the fourth graders' pass rate.
- Fourth graders' pass rate = 0.40
- Fifth graders' pass rate = \(2 \times 0.40 = 0.80\) or 80%
- Number of students: 400
- Number of students who passed = \(0.80 \times 400 = 320\)

Now, let's calculate the overall pass rate for the school.

Total number of students = 500 (third graders) + 100 (fourth graders) + 400 (fifth graders) = 1000

Total number of students who passed = 340 (third graders) + 40 (fourth graders) + 320 (fifth graders) = 680

Overall pass rate = \(\frac{680}{1000} = 0.68\) or 68%

The school's overall pass rate is 68%."
"First, let's determine the total number of glass chips Milo has. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:
\[ 72 \times 2 = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, the number of square inches he can make is:
\[ \frac{144}{12} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. Let's denote the length of the mosaic as \( L \) inches. The area of the mosaic, which is the product of its height and length, is:
\[ 3 \times L = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the length of the mosaic Milo can make is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

- Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea. So, the total amount of tea consumed by these students is \(4 \times 1.5 = 6\) quarts.
- Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea. So, the total amount of tea consumed by these students is \(16 \times 2 = 32\) quarts.

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed by all the students:
\[6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts}\]

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is the sum of the tea consumed and the tea left:
\[38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts}\]

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total amount of tea from quarts to gallons:
\[48 \text{ quarts} \div 4 = 12 \text{ gallons}\]

Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is \(\boxed{12}\) gallons."
"Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 butterscotch candies, which means he needed to order more to meet the demand. He then ordered an additional 100 candies. 

To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he now has and then subtract the number of candies he has already sold.

1. Total candies after the second order: \(100 + 100 = 200\)
2. Candies sold: 150

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month, starting from the beginning of the year, and then find the difference between the number of students at the end of May and the initial number of students.

1. **Initial number of students**: 10
2. **End of January**: The number of students doubles, so \(10 \times 2 = 20\)
3. **End of February**: The number of students doubles again, so \(20 \times 2 = 40\)
4. **End of March**: The number of students doubles again, so \(40 \times 2 = 80\)
5. **End of April**: The number of students doubles again, so \(80 \times 2 = 160\)
6. **End of May**: The number of students doubles again, so \(160 \times 2 = 320\)

Now, we need to find the additional number of students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year.

- Number of students at the end of May: 320
- Number of students at the beginning of the year: 10

"To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. During the week, he made $105. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total earnings by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25 \text{ per branch}} = 420 \text{ branches}
\]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420 \text{ branches}}{7 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ branches per day}
\]

Thus, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is:

\[
\boxed{60}

"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picked:

1. She picked 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
2. She picked 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
3. She picked 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
4. She picked 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\]

Next, we account for the flowers she drops. She drops 1 of each type of flower she picked:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\]

Subtracting the petals of the dropped flowers from the initial total gives:
\[101 - 22 = 79\]

So, the total number of petals in the vase is:
\[
\boxed{79}

"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used and dropped:

- John makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.
- DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.
- They dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.

The total number of marshmallows used and dropped is:
\[ 9 + 9 + 3 = 21 \]

The original number of marshmallows in the bag was 35. After using and dropping some, the number of marshmallows left is:
\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \]

Since John and DeSean are sharing the remaining marshmallows equally, each can have:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, each kid can have \(\boxed{7}\) S'mores."
"First, let's break down the time each person can play:

1. Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
2. Two of Jack's friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes per quarter.
3. The third friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes per quarter.

Next, we need to determine how many quarters each person uses in 4 hours (240 minutes):

- Jack: \(\frac{240}{20} = 12\) quarters
- Each of the two friends who play for 10 minutes: \(\frac{240}{10} = 24\) quarters
- The friend who plays for 30 minutes: \(\frac{240}{30} = 8\) quarters

Now, we sum the quarters used by all four friends:

\[12 + 24 + 24 + 8 = 68\]

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is:

\[68 \times 0.25 = 17\]

Therefore, the total amount of money used is \(\boxed{17}\)."
"Let's define the variables for the quantities of each ingredient Tanya uses:
- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces.

According to the problem, the total amount of ingredients in the salt scrub is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]
We can divide the entire equation by 2 to simplify:
\[ z + 2s = 5 \]

We need to find the value of \( 2s \), which represents the amount of oil. To do this, we need to express \( z \) in terms of \( s \) or vice versa. From the equation \( z + 2s = 5 \), we can solve for \( z \):
\[ z = 5 - 2s \]

Since \( z \) and \( s \) are both positive quantities and must be such that the total is 10 ounces, we can substitute \( z = 5 - 2s \) back into the equation to check the values. However, we only need to find \( 2s \), which is the amount of oil. From the equation \( z + 2s = 5 \), we can see that if we choose a value for \( s \) that makes \( z \) a positive number, the equation will hold. For example, if \( s = 1 \), then \( z = 5 - 2 \cdot 1 = 3 \). This satisfies the equation.

Thus, the amount of oil, which is \( 2s \), is:
\[ 2s = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{2}\) ounces."
"John bought 3 goats at $500 each and 2 cows at $1500 each.

63 - 48 = 15

Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"First, let's determine how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. The number of cars he gives away is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of cars Joe has after selling and giving some away. The total number of cars he no longer has is the sum of the cars he sold and the cars he gave away:

\[ 8 + 16 = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Therefore, the number of cars Joe remains with is:

\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much money came from the students. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, and they collectively raised $125,000. So, the amount each student raised is:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

Therefore, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\)."

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day, which is:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

To find the total time Sandy walked over the two days in hours, we add the hours from both days:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ hours} \]

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ 12 \times 60 = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:
\[ 720 \text{ minutes} \]"
"Initially, Hunter counted 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars entered, making the total number of cars:

\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]

During the lunch break, half of the cars left the parking lot. Therefore, the number of cars that left is:

\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

The number of cars remaining in the parking lot during the lunch break is:

\[ 70 - 35 = 35 \]

Thus, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is:

\[ 35 \]"
"First, let's calculate how much John makes in a single cycle of work. Each cycle consists of 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20. Therefore, the payment for one cycle is:

\[ 5 \text{ tasks} \times \$1.20 \text{ per task} = \$6.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much John makes in a day. Since he does 30 cycles of work each day, the daily earnings are:

\[ 30 \text{ cycles} \times \$6.00 \text{ per cycle} = \$180.00 \]

Finally, to find out how much he makes in a full 7-day week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7:

\[ \$180.00 \text{ per day} \times 7 \text{ days} = \$1260.00 \]

So, John makes \(\$1260.00\) in a full 7-day week."
"In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points. In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her scores from each game:
\[14 + 4 = 18\]

Therefore, the total points Sasha scored during both games is \(\boxed{18}\)."

\[ 88 \text{ tins} - 36 \text{ tins} = 52 \text{ tins} \]

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food."
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Next, we isolate \( P \) by subtracting 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Then, we solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have. Smendrick has:
\[ 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \]

And Becca has:
\[ 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, the number of cards Becca has is:
\[ \boxed{153} \]"
"Cindy had 5 green eggs.

She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.

She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.

She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

To find the total number of eggs, we add the number of each color of egg together:
\[5 \text{ (green)} + 10 \text{ (blue)} + 9 \text{ (pink)} + 3 \text{ (yellow)} = 27\]

Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"First, let's calculate the refund Milly will receive from Amazon. The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of this amount.

\[ \text{Refund} = 32 \times 0.75 = 24 \]

Next, we need to calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound and $0.08 per mile. The book weighs 4 pounds and needs to be returned 20 miles.

\[ \text{Weight cost} = 4 \times 0.35 = 1.40 \]
\[ \text{Distance cost} = 20 \times 0.08 = 1.60 \]
\[ \text{Total shipping cost} = 1.40 + 1.60 = 3.00 \]

Now, we can determine how much money Milly will lose by subtracting the refund from the total cost of the book and the shipping cost.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 32 + 3.00 = 35.00 \]
\[ \text{Money lost} = 35.00 - 24.00 = 11.00 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Milly will lose is:

\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Mulan starts with $40 and her father gives her an additional $100. So, the total amount of money she has initially is:
\[ 40 + 100 = 140 \]

Next, she buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each. The cost for the jeans is:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

She also buys a bag for $20. The total cost of the bag is:
\[ 20 \]

The total amount spent is the sum of the cost of the jeans and the bag:
\[ 60 + 20 = 80 \]

To find out how much money Mulan has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money she had:
\[ 140 - 80 = 60 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. Let's break down the production for each week:

1. **First week**: Boris produces 8,000 bars.
2. **Second week**: Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars.
3. **Third week**: Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is \( 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \) bars.

Now, let's calculate the total production for the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars} \]

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, the production for the fourth week is:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars} \]

Therefore, the production for the fourth week is \(\boxed{14000}\)."
"First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on each activity per week and then multiply by four to find the monthly total.

1. **Time spent recording videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Total time spent recording videos per week = \(18 \times 4 = 72\) minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Total time spent writing songs per week = 2 hours = 120 minutes.

3. **Time spent doing makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week.
   - Total time spent doing makeup per week = \(15 \times 6 = 90\) minutes.

Now, let's sum up the total time spent on all activities per week:
\[ 72 \text{ minutes (recording)} + 120 \text{ minutes (writing)} + 90 \text{ minutes (makeup)} = 282 \text{ minutes per week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total time spent on TikTok in a month is:
\[ 282 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 1128 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 1128 \text{ minutes} \]"
"First, let's break down the costs:

1. The base installation cost for 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures is $129.00.
2. Angela needs 6 mirrors, which is 2 more than the base 4 mirrors, so the additional cost for mirrors is \(2 \times 15 = 30\) dollars.
3. Angela needs 2 chandeliers, which is 1 more than the base 1 chandelier, so the additional cost for chandeliers is \(1 \times 15 = 15\) dollars.
4. Angela needs 20 pictures, which is 10 more than the base 10 pictures, so the additional cost for pictures is \(10 \times 15 = 150\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the costs:

- Base installation cost: $129.00
- Additional cost for mirrors: $30.00
- Additional cost for chandeliers: $15.00
- Additional cost for pictures: $150.00

Total cost = $129.00 + $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $224.00

Therefore, the total cost for Angela is $224.00."
"First, let's determine how much money Anthony has saved. Since Eva has saved $20.00 and Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. We know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:

\[ 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \]

Therefore, Roy's savings are:

\[ \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 12 = 30 + 12 = 42 \]

So, the amount of money Roy has is:

\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to follow the chain of relationships given in the problem.

1. **Pompei's lifting capacity:**
   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.

2. **Saskay's lifting capacity:**
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - Therefore, Saskay can lift \( 12 \times 1 \) inch = 12 inches.

3. **Kagiyami's lifting capacity:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - Therefore, Kagiyami can lift \( 4 \times 12 \) inches = 48 inches.

4. **Naruto's lifting capacity:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - Therefore, Naruto can lift \( 10 \times 48 \) inches = 480 inches.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 480 inches to feet:
\[ 480 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high."
"Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour. 

For the first part of his journey, he travels for 4 hours:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

After resting, he travels for another 6 hours:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the distances from both parts of his journey:
\[ 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles."
"First, let's determine the speed of the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can calculate the time it would take for one kangaroo to do the same distance. Since the speed is the same for all kangaroos, the time for one kangaroo would also be 18 hours.

Next, we need to find the speed of the turtles. The problem states that each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo. Therefore, if a kangaroo takes 18 hours, a turtle, traveling at half the speed, would take twice as long to cover the same distance.

So, the time it takes for one turtle to travel across the highway is:
\[ 18 \text{ hours} \times 2 = 36 \text{ hours} \]

Since the question asks how long it will take four turtles to travel across the highway, and they are all traveling at the same speed, the time remains the same for all four turtles. Therefore, the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway is:
\[ 36 \text{ hours} \]

Final answer:
\[ 36 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of clay dishes each person makes based on the information given.

1. Kora made 20 dishes.
2. Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory makes \(20 + 20 = 40\) dishes.
3. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada makes \(2 \times 40 = 80\) dishes.

Now, we add the number of dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora together:
\[20 + 40 + 80 = 140\]

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes they all make together is \(\boxed{140}\)."
"First, let's determine the final price of the laptop after the trade-in discount. The original price of the laptop is $600, and the trade-in discount is $200. Therefore, the final price of the laptop is:

\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Erika needs an additional $50 to buy the laptop, so the total amount of money she currently has is:

\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \]

Next, we need to account for the sources of her current savings. She has been paid $150 this week and her mom has given her $80. Let's denote the amount of money she has in her purse as \( x \). Therefore, the total amount of money she has is the sum of the money in her purse, the money from her job, and the money from her mom:

\[ x + 150 + 80 = 350 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 230 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

So, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of apple slices Adam gets from slicing the apples.

- From 3 large apples, he gets \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices.
- From 5 small apples, he gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.

So, the total number of slices is \(15 + 15 = 30\).

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is \(30 - 15 = 15\).

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk a day from one cow. Therefore, with 3 cows, he extracts:

\[ 5 \text{ liters/cow} \times 3 \text{ cows} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, he needs:

\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed is:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and then sum these lengths.

1. **First glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Unused portion: \(1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}\)
   - Length of unused portion: \(12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10\) millimeters

2. **Second glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Unused portion: \(1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}\)
   - Length of unused portion: \(12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4\) millimeters

3. **Third glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Unused portion: \(1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}\)
   - Length of unused portion: \(12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6\) millimeters

Now, we sum the lengths of the unused portions:
\[10 + 4 + 6 = 20\]

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is \(\boxed{20}\) millimeters."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Gabriel wants to buy:
- Car: $10000
- Phone: $800

Total cost = $10000 + $800 = $10800

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Gabriel currently has:
- Money from working on weekends: $5000
- Money from his brother: $200

Total money Gabriel has = $5000 + $200 = $5200

Now, let's find out how much more money Gabriel needs:
Total cost - Total money Gabriel has = $10800 - $5200 = $5600

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5600."
"Thea gave the craftsman four $20 bills, which totals to \(4 \times 20 = 80\) dollars. The hat cost $70. Therefore, the change she received is \(80 - 70 = 10\) dollars.

The change Thea received is \(10\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Craig has initially. Since he has 2 twenty dollar bills, he starts with:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the six squirt guns. Each squirt gun costs $2, so the total cost for the squirt guns is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the three packs of water balloons. Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for the water balloons is:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the squirt guns and the water balloons to find the total amount spent:
\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Craig had to find out how much money he has left:
\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Craig has left is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks. Therefore, the number of socks Jack has is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. Therefore, Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. Therefore, Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Jack's total: \( 30 \) socks + \( 60 \) dishes = \( 90 \)
- Peter's total: \( 60 \) socks + \( 30 \) dishes = \( 90 \)

Adding these together, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is \( 90 + 90 = 180 \).

**Final numerical answer:**

"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the given information and categorize the students accordingly.

1. There are 20 students in total.
2. 5 students are good at math only.
3. 8 students perform well in English only.
4. The rest are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. We know the total number of students and the number of students who are good at only one subject:

\[ \text{Number of students good at both} = \text{Total students} - (\text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at English only}) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Number of students good at both} = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only and the students who are good at both math and English:

\[ \text{Total students good at math} = \text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at both} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Total students good at math} = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students good at math is 12."
"First, let's calculate the total time required for one group to perform, including the time to get on stage, perform, and exit the stage. This is given by:

\[ 2 \text{ minutes} + 6 \text{ minutes} + 2 \text{ minutes} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to account for the intermission time, which is 10 minutes. The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the intermission time from the total concert time to find out how much time is available for the groups to perform:

\[ 120 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we divide the available performance time by the time required for one group to perform to find out how many groups can perform:

\[ \frac{110 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/group}} = 11 \text{ groups} \]

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:

"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and add it to the original investment.

1. **Identify the principal amount (P):**
   \[
   P = \$300
   \]

2. **Determine the annual interest rate (r):**
   The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year. Therefore, the interest rate is:
   \[
   r = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\%
   \]
   However, this interpretation seems incorrect because the interest rate should be a fraction of 100%. Let's assume the correct interpretation is that the interest rate is 75% (since three-quarters of 100% is 75%).

3. **Calculate the annual interest (I):**
   \[
   I = P \times r = 300 \times 0.75 = 225
   \]

4. **Calculate the total interest over 3 years:**
   \[
   \text{Total Interest} = I \times \text{number of years} = 225 \times 3 = 675
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount after 3 years:**
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = P + \text{Total Interest} = 300 + 675 = 975

"First, let's break down the information given:

- The clothing store has 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts.
- Half of the white shirts have collars, so the number of white shirts with collars is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).
- Therefore, the number of white shirts without collars is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

- Out of the 50 floral shirts, 20 have buttons. So, the number of floral shirts without buttons is \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

Now, we need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars:

- Number of floral shirts without buttons: 30
- Number of white shirts without collars: 20

The difference is \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

Therefore, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X. Since he sold 10 goats from Farm X, he sold:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]
goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \]

Adding the remaining goats from both farms together, we get:
\[ 45 + 25 = 70 \]

Therefore, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is:

Next, calculate the total cost for the baskets of red food:
- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- You are getting $2 off for each basket of red food.
- The discounted price for each basket of red food = \( 18 - 2 = 16 \) dollars.
- You are buying 3 baskets of red food.
- Total cost for red food = \( 3 \times 16 = 48 \) dollars.

Finally, add the total costs for both types of baskets to find the overall total:

"Let's define the variables for the ages:
- Let \( B \) be the age of your brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of your sister.
- Let \( Y \) be your age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( Y = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( Y = S + 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( \text{Mom's age} = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( Y + S + B + (3B - 1) = 87 \).

First, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( Y \):
\[ S = Y - 2 \]

Now substitute \( Y = B - 3 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \]

Next, substitute \( Y = B - 3 \) and \( S = B - 5 \) into the sum of all ages equation:
\[ (B - 3) + (B - 5) + B + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B - 5 + B + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, find your age \( Y \):
\[ Y = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

So, you are \(\boxed{13}\) years old."
"First, we need to determine the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we calculate:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and then sum them up.

**Day 0:**
- Initially, 10 people are infected.

**Day 1:**
- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections on Day 1: \(10 \times 6 = 60\)
- Total infected after Day 1: \(10 + 60 = 70\)

**Day 2:**
- Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections on Day 2: \(70 \times 6 = 420\)
- Total infected after Day 2: \(70 + 420 = 490\)

**Day 3:**
- Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections on Day 3: \(490 \times 6 = 2940\)
- Total infected after Day 3: \(490 + 2940 = 3430\)

Therefore, the total number of people infected after three days is **3430**."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tips Rafaela received. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ customers} \times \$20 \text{ per customer} = \$800 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips, we calculate:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$800 = 0.10 \times \$800 = \$80 \]

Since Julieta received 10% less, we subtract this amount from Rafaela's total tips:

\[ \$800 - \$80 = \$720 \]

Now, to find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their individual totals together:

\[ \$800 + \$720 = \$1520 \]

Therefore, the total amount of tips received by Julieta and Rafaela altogether is:

\[ \$1520 \]"
"Jennifer initially bought 12 oranges.

She gave 2 oranges to each of her three daughters, which totals:
\[ 2 \text{ oranges/daughter} \times 3 \text{ daughters} = 6 \text{ oranges} \]

She also gave 3 oranges to her son.

So, the total number of oranges given away is:
\[ 6 \text{ oranges} + 3 \text{ oranges} = 9 \text{ oranges} \]

Therefore, the number of oranges she remained with is:
\[ 12 \text{ oranges} - 9 \text{ oranges} = 3 \text{ oranges} \]

**3**"
"First, let's determine how many badges each person earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge every month. Therefore, in a year (12 months), Claire earns:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so she earns 1 badge every 2 months. Therefore, in a year, Amber earns:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. Therefore, in a year, Wendy earns:
\[ 3 \times 12 \text{ badges} = 36 \text{ badges} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year:
\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

Therefore, Wendy earns \(\boxed{30}\) more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame."
"First, let's determine how many hours Paige spent baking. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours.

Next, we calculate the number of banana bread loaves she baked in those 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, in 5 hours she baked:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. Therefore, the total amount raised from selling all the slices is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount raised is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"If Gretchen has 70 gold coins and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, then she has \(70 - 30 = 40\) silver coins.

Gretchen had a total of 110 coins."
"First, calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students. Since there are 50 students and each student was given 10 burritos, the total number of burritos consumed by the students is:

\[ 50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos/student} = 500 \text{ burritos} \]

Next, add the number of burritos Mr. George ate to the total consumed by the students:

\[ 500 \text{ burritos} + 20 \text{ burritos} = 520 \text{ burritos} \]

Finally, subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered to find the number of leftover burritos:

\[ 600 \text{ burritos} - 520 \text{ burritos} = 80 \text{ burritos} \]

Therefore, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is:

\[ 80 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of green cars. Since there are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, and there are 12 red cars, the number of green cars is:
\[ 12 - 2 = 10 \]

Next, we calculate the number of blue cars. The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars, so:
\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \]

Now, we know the total number of cars in the rink is 75. We can find the number of yellow cars by subtracting the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:
\[ 75 - (12 + 10 + 30) = 75 - 52 = 23 \]

Therefore, the number of yellow cars is:
\[ \boxed{23} \]"
"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as \( F \), Anne has as \( A \), and Sofie has as \( S \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \)
2. \( S = A + 25 \)
3. \( A = F - 12 \)

First, substitute \( A = F - 12 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \]

Now, substitute \( S = F + 13 \) and \( A = F - 12 \) into the total books equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \( \boxed{28} \) books."
"Daisy bought a bag of sweet potatoes that weighed 2 times the weight of the bag of potatoes. Since the bag of potatoes weighed 5 pounds, the bag of sweet potatoes weighed \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pounds.

The bag of carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the bag of sweet potatoes. Therefore, the weight of the bag of carrots is \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds.

So, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots."
"First, we need to determine the total number of jello cups Greg needs. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid will have 4 jello cups, the total number of jello cups required is:

\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups per kid} = 120 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many three-ounce boxes of jello are required to make 120 cups. Since one three-ounce box makes 10 cups, the number of boxes needed is:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Since each box is on sale for $1.25, the total cost for 12 boxes is:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

Therefore, Greg will spend \(\boxed{15}\) dollars on jello."
"The electronics seller bought 5 phones for $700 each, so the total cost for the phones is:

\[ 5 \times 700 = 3500 \]

The seller gives $4000 in dollar bills. To find out how much change the seller will give back, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given:

\[ 4000 - 3500 = 500 \]

Therefore, the seller will give back $500 in change."
"First, let's determine the total monthly cost of groceries, which is $400.

Madeline pays 60% of the total cost. Therefore, the amount Madeline pays per month is:
\[ 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total cost is $400 and Madeline pays $240, Keenan pays the remaining 40% of the total cost:
\[ 0.40 \times 400 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

This $160 is the total amount Keenan pays per month. To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we divide the monthly amount by 4 (since there are 4 weeks in a month):
\[ \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Therefore, Keenan spends \(\boxed{40}\) dollars per week."
"First, let's calculate how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 pieces:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ pieces} \]

After the first day, the number of pieces left is:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces} \]

On the second day, Tobias ate 10 pieces. So, the number of pieces left after the second day is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

On the third day, Tobias ate \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining 26 pieces:

\[ \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, let's sum up all the pieces Tobias has eaten so far:

\[ 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 \]

So, the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten so far is:

\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost per bottle for soda and water.

The cost for 7 bottles of soda is $21.00. Therefore, the cost per bottle of soda is:
\[ \frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00 \]
So, each bottle of soda costs $3.00.

The cost for 4 bottles of water is $8.00. Therefore, the cost per bottle of water is:
\[ \frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00 \]
So, each bottle of water costs $2.00.

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.

The cost for 3 bottles of soda is:
\[ 3 \times 3.00 = 9.00 \]

The cost for 2 bottles of water is:
\[ 2 \times 2.00 = 4.00 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ 9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is:
\[ \boxed{13.00} \]"
"To find out how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 16 bolts.
2. Subtract the total cost from David's initial amount of money.

First, let's calculate the total cost of 16 bolts. Each bolt costs $0.03, so the total cost is:
\[ 16 \times 0.03 = 0.48 \]

Next, we subtract the total cost from David's initial amount of money:
\[ 12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00 \]

So, the amount of money David has left after paying for the bolts is:
\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"
"First, we need to determine Ella's hourly rate for dog walking. She earned $33 for 3 hours of work. To find her hourly rate, we divide the total earnings by the number of hours worked:

\[
\text{Hourly rate} = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \text{ dollars per hour}
\]

Next, we need to calculate how much she would earn if she worked for 12 hours at this rate. We multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours she plans to work:

\[
\text{Earnings for 12 hours} = 11 \times 12 = 132
\]

Therefore, Ella would earn \(\boxed{132}\) dollars after 12 hours of dog walking."
"Paul initially has 52 marbles. His friend gave him 28 more marbles, so he then has:

\[ 52 + 28 = 80 \]

Next, Paul lost \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he lost, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \]

Subtracting the lost marbles from the total, we get:

\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

So, Paul has \(\boxed{60}\) marbles left."
"First, let's calculate the points Amy scores from each type of question.

1. **Multiple-choice questions:**
   - Total questions: 10
   - Correctly answered: 80% of 10 = \(0.80 \times 10 = 8\)
   - Points per question: 1
   - Total points from multiple-choice: \(8 \times 1 = 8\)

2. **True/false questions:**
   - Total questions: 20
   - Correctly answered: 90% of 20 = \(0.90 \times 20 = 18\)
   - Points per question: 1

"First, let's determine how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. He has 300 chickens and plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of them.

\[
\text{Number of chickens to sell} = 300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180
\]

Next, we know that Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000 by selling these 180 chickens at $50 each. The total revenue from selling 180 chickens at $50 each is:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000
\]

This total revenue of $9000 includes the cost of the chickens he bought plus the $2000 profit. Therefore, the cost of the chickens he bought is:

\[
\text{Cost of chickens} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Profit} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000
\]

Since Isaias bought 180 chickens, the cost per chicken is:

\[
\text{Cost per chicken} = \frac{\text{Cost of chickens}}{\text{Number of chickens}} = \frac{7000}{180} = \frac{700}{18} = \frac{350}{9} \approx 38.89
\]

However, the question asks for the total amount Isaias spent on the chickens he took to the market, which we have already calculated as $7000.

\[
\boxed{7000}

"First, let's determine how many glasses of lemonade Micah and Mitchell sold in total. Since Julie sold 14 glasses and the total sales were 32 glasses, the boys together sold:

\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \text{ glasses} \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses equally between the two:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ glasses each} \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses. To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number Julie sold:

\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

5"
"First, let's determine how much Iris spent on the manicure. Since she spent 1/4 as much on the manicure as she did on her hair, we calculate:

\[ \text{Manicure cost} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the pedicure. She spent 3/4 as much on the pedicure as she did on the manicure:

\[ \text{Pedicure cost} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent at the spa:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Hair cost} + \text{Manicure cost} + \text{Pedicure cost} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is:

\[ \boxed{575} \]"
"First, we calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling the rope. The rope is 20 meters long and she sells it for $2 per meter.

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40 \]

Next, we determine the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter and we assume she buys a rope of the same length (20 meters).

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$30 \]

Now, we find out how much money Sarah will have left after buying the new rope.

\[ \$40 - \$30 = \$10 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Sarah will have left over after she buys the new rope is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age.

1. If Melanie will be 18 years old in 10 years, her current age is \(18 - 10 = 8\) years old.

2. We need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Three times her current age is \(3 \times 8 = 24\) years.

3. Let \(x\) be the number of years from now when Melanie's age will be 24. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   8 + x = 24
   \]

4. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 24 - 8 = 16
   \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item category:

1. **Bacon:**
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon.
   - Total cost for bacon = $10.

2. **Chicken:**
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Cost of one packet of chicken = 2 * $2 = $4.
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   - Total cost for chicken = 6 * $4 = $24.

3. **Strawberries:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries.
   - Total cost for strawberries = 3 * $4 = $12.

4. **Apples:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Cost of one pack of apples = $4 / 2 = $2.
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples.
   - Total cost for apples = 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's sum up the total cost of all items:
- Total cost = Cost of bacon + Cost of chicken + Cost of strawberries + Cost of apples
- Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65. Therefore, the amount of money she has left in her budget is:
- Remaining budget = Budget - Total cost
- Remaining budget = $65 - $60 = $5.

**Final Answer:**

"Let's denote the usual length of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes.

According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, plus a 15-minute encore. This can be expressed as:
\[ 2x + 15 \]

We know that the runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is \( 25 \) minutes.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Argo initially has 200 toys. He gives away a total of 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys.

Argo now has 50 toys."
"On Tuesdays, the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesdays, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Fridays, they make twice as many as on a Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

To find the total number of chimichangas made on these three days, we add the number of chimichangas made each day:
\[125 + 125 + 250 = 500\]

Therefore, the total number of chimichangas made on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays is 500."
"First, we need to determine how many microphones will not find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. Given that 20% of the 50 microphones won't fit, we calculate 20% of 50:

\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

This means 10 microphones will not be paired. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be paired is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged on the stage is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.
2. He sees \( \frac{2}{3} \) of that number of birds flying overhead. So, we calculate \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) birds.
3. He also sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, we calculate \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) birds.

So, there are 10 cookies in each jar."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals for the orchids and the daisies.

For the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the orchids is \(5 \times 5 = 25\).

For the daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the daisies is \(4 \times 10 = 40\).

Next, we need to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids:
- The difference in the number of petals is \(40 - 25 = 15\).

So, the daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids.

"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25
\]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[
\text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75
\]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants. So, we calculate the number of outdoor plants as follows:

\[
\text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50
\]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. Therefore, the number of flowering plants is:

\[
\text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25
\]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants is:

\[
\boxed{25\%}

"Given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can first determine the speed of a thingamabob.

Let the speed of a thingamabob be \( v \) meters per second. Then, the speed of a whatchamacallit is \( 11v \). Since the speed of a whatchamacallit is 121 meters per second, we have:
\[ 11v = 121 \]
Solving for \( v \):
\[ v = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \]
So, the speed of a thingamabob is 11 meters per second.

Next, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a whirligig is:
\[ 5 \times 11 = 55 \]
So, the speed of a whirligig is \(\boxed{55}\) meters per second."

"First, let's calculate Mark's new hourly wage after the raise. 

Mark used to make $10 per hour. With a raise of $2 per hour, his new hourly wage is:
\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, we calculate his weekly earnings by multiplying his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week:
\[ 12 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 480 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Therefore, Mark makes \(\boxed{480}\) dollars a week."

   - The total earnings from mowing all the lawns is \( 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J \).

5. **Determine the Total Earnings:**
   - Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Let \( L \) be the earnings from lemonade sales. So, \( L + 54J = 80 \).

6. **Find the Value of \( J \):**
   - Since \( J \) is the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn, and she was paid $6 per mowing, we need to find a value for \( J \) that makes sense in the context of the problem. Let's assume \( J \) is a whole number.
   - If \( J = 1 \), then \( 54J = 54 \), and \( L = 80 - 54 = 26 \).
   - If \( J = 2 \), then \( 54J = 108 \), which is more than $80, so \( J = 1 \) is the only feasible solution.

7. **Calculate the Earnings from Lemonade Sales:**
   - From the above, if \( J = 1 \), then \( L = 26 \).

Therefore, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is \(\boxed{26}\)."
"First, let's determine Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, and Martin's weight is 55 kg, we calculate Carl's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we find Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so we calculate Christian's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we determine Harry's weight. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so we calculate Harry's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate how much John earns from renting out his car each month.

John rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, and he gets paid $25 an hour. So, the total hours he rents out his car each month is:
\[ 10 \text{ times} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate his total earnings from renting the car:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$750 \]

Now, we need to subtract his car payment from his total earnings to find his profit:
\[ \$750 - \$500 = \$250 \]

Therefore, John's profit from renting out his car each month is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"First, we determine how many notebooks Martha originally had. Since Martha ended up with 7 notebooks after buying 5 more, we can calculate the number of notebooks she originally had as follows:

\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, we calculate the number of notebooks Joseph had as:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has compared to Joseph after her purchase. Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph still has 6 notebooks. The difference is:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

Therefore, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Dijana rowed for 50 miles. Anis rowed \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more miles than Dijana, which means Anis rowed \( 50 + \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 50 + 10 = 60 \) miles.

The total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis is \( 50 + 60 = 110 \) miles.

Therefore, the total distance they rowed on that day is 110 miles."
"Initially, Susan made 100 cookies. Her husband snuck 4 cookies for himself, leaving:

\[ 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Now, these 96 cookies are to be equally divided among her 6 nephews. To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we divide 96 by 6:

\[ 96 \div 6 = 16 \]

Each of Susan’s nephews will get 16 cookies."
"Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages.

Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.

So, the total number of pages Denise read is \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.

Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and 0 pages today, so he read a total of \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages Daniel read from the total pages Denise read: \(28 - 13 = 15\).

Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.

15"
"First, let's determine the total amount of soup Calvin has. The pot can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. Since Calvin is an adult, we can use the adult's bowl measurement as the standard. Therefore, the total amount of soup is equivalent to 4 adult bowls.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of bowls of soup that will be consumed by Calvin and his family. Calvin and his wife are adults, and they will each have one bowl, so that's 2 bowls. The two children will each have one bowl, so that's 2 more bowls. In total, they will consume 2 (adults) + 2 (children) = 4 bowls of soup.

Since the total amount of soup is 4 adult bowls and they will consume 4 bowls, there will be no soup left over for the children to have additional bowls for lunch. 

Therefore, each child will be able to have 0 bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

Adding these together gives the total amount spent:
\[ 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00 \]

Therefore, William spent a total of $8.00."
"To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, calculate the material needed for 20 small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, to find out how much material is needed for 1 small mask, we divide 2 yards by 4:
  \[
  \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask}
  \]
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is:
  \[
  20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards}
  \]

Next, calculate the material needed for 8 large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, to find out how much material is needed for 1 large mask, we divide 2.25 yards by 3:
  \[
  \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask}
  \]
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is:
  \[
  8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards}
  \]

Finally, add the material needed for the small and large masks together:
\[
10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards}
\]

Therefore, Jo would need \boxed{16} yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of times Deepa saw the movies.
2. Divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets purchased.

First, we calculate the total number of times Deepa saw the movies:
- There are 9 movies.
- She saw each movie 3 times.

\[
\text{Total number of times} = 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ times}
\]

Next, we know she spent $216 in total. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

\[
\text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{\$216}{27 \text{ tickets}} = \$8
\]

So, the average price she paid per ticket is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"First, let's break down Harold's daily activities and their durations:

1. **Sleeping**: Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. **Working**: He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. **Walking the dog**: He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Next, we calculate the total time spent on these activities:
- Time spent sleeping: 10 hours
- Time spent working: 8 hours
- Time spent walking the dog: 1 hour

Adding these times together gives:
\[ 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

There are 24 hours in a day. To find the free time Harold has left, we subtract the total time spent on activities from the total hours in a day:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Harold has \(\boxed{5}\) hours of free time left in his day."
"Tim starts with 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes.

He uses 3 blue shoe boxes for fishing. So, the number of blue shoe boxes left is:
\[ 7 - 3 = 4 \]

He uses \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his red shoe boxes for fishing. So, the number of red shoe boxes used is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of red shoe boxes left is:
\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \]

So, the total number of shoe boxes left in Tim's box is:
\[ 4 \text{ (blue)} + 6 \text{ (red)} = 10 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 10 \]"
"Sarah has 9 books. Joseph had twice the number of Sarah’s books, so Joseph originally had \(9 \times 2 = 18\) books. Joseph lost 2 of them, so he currently has \(18 - 2 = 16\) books.

"First, we calculate how many marbles Dean gives to Jamie. Since Dean gives 1/5 of his 30 marbles to Jamie, we perform the following calculation:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6 \]

So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie.

Next, we subtract the 6 marbles given to Jamie and the 10 marbles given to Donald from Dean's original 30 marbles:

\[ 30 - 6 - 10 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles left for Dean is:

\[ 14 \]"
"Let's denote Duncan's current age as \( D \) and Adam's current age as \( A \).

Given:
- Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).
- Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago.

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( 60 - 8 = 52 \).
Four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).

According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago:
\[ 52 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]

Now, solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years:
\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years."
"Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is \(2 \times 200 = 400\) acres.

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm, so it is \(400 + 100 = 500\) acres.

Together, the two farms have \(200 + 500 = 700\) acres.

"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, we calculate:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ packages per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. We multiply the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours he works:

\[ 40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Now, we calculate how much money he earns. Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes, we multiply the number of packages by his pay rate:

\[ 320 \text{ packages} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/package} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

   - Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
   - Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
   - Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
   - There are 20 red balloons.

2. **Calculate the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons:**
   - Since each red balloon gets 2 pieces of bologna, and there are 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is:
     \[
     20 \text{ red balloons} \times 2 \text{ pieces per red balloon} = 40 \text{ pieces}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons:**
   - The total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58. Therefore, the number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Julia and Nadine bought.

1. The cost of the cake is $11.
2. The cost of the balloons: Since 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The cost of the ice cream: 2 tubs of ice cream cost $7 each, so the total cost is:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to buy these items, the total amount they had together is $28. Since they had the same amount of allowance, let's denote the amount each girl had as \( x \). Therefore, the total amount is:
\[
2x = 28
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{28}{2} = 14
\]

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them \(\boxed{14}\) dollars."

"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Let's break down the information step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(3 \times 7 = 21\) fish.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\).

"First, let's calculate how much money Colby has spent so far this month.

1. **Movies on Fridays and Saturdays:**
   - He saw 5 movies on Fridays and Saturdays.
   - Each ticket costs $10.
   - Total spent on these movies: \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars.

2. **Movies on other days:**
   - He saw 8 movies on other days.
   - Each ticket costs $7.
   - Total spent on these movies: \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars.

3. **Popcorn:**
   - He had 2 tubs of popcorn.
   - Each tub costs $8.
   - Total spent on popcorn: \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.

4. **Candy:**
   - He had 4 boxes of candy.
   - Each box costs $2.
   - Total spent on candy: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.

Now, let's sum up all the expenses:
\[50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = 130\] dollars.

Colby's parents give him $150 each month to spend. So, the remaining money is:
\[150 - 130 = 20\] dollars.

On the last day of the month, it is a Friday, and he wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy. The cost for these items is:
\[8 + 2 = 10\] dollars.

After buying the popcorn and candy, the remaining money is:
\[20 - 10 = 10\] dollars.

Since each movie ticket on a Friday or Saturday costs $10, with $10 remaining, he can buy one more ticket.

Therefore, the total number of movies he can see this month is:
\[5 + 8 + 1 = 14\] movies.

Final numerical answer:

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the week and then divide by the number of days.

1. **Monday**: 39 Junebugs
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
3. **Wednesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
4. **Thursday**: 48 Junebugs
5. **Friday**: 57 Junebugs

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed each day:
\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"First, calculate the distance traveled by the bus:
- The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance traveled by the bus = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

Next, calculate the distance traveled by the car:
- The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance traveled by the car = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, find the difference in distance traveled by the bus and the car:

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify and combine like terms:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the number of water balloons each person initially received. Maria invited 4 friends, and each friend, including Maria, received 2 water balloons at the start. So, the total number of balloons given at the start is:

\[ 4 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ balloons per friend} + 1 \text{ balloon for Maria} = 8 + 1 = 9 \text{ balloons} \]

Next, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (4 friends + Maria), the total number of additional balloons given is:

\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ balloons per person} = 15 \text{ balloons} \]

Now, we add the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons to find the total number of balloons:

\[ 9 \text{ initial balloons} + 15 \text{ additional balloons} = 24 \text{ balloons} \]

So, the total number of balloons the girls had is:

\[ \boxed{24} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated and already owned by the charity group.

- Each of the 10 people donates 5 boxes, so the total number of donated boxes is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) boxes.
- They already have 10 boxes.

Adding these together, the total number of boxes is \(50 + 10 = 60\) boxes.

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all these boxes. Each table can hold 2 boxes of stuff.

- The total number of tables needed is \(60 \div 2 = 30\) tables.

Since they already own 15 tables, the number of new tables they need is \(30 - 15 = 15\).

Therefore, the number of new tables they need is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, calculate the total distance spat by Zoey:
- Zoey has 40 seeds and each seed is spat 10 feet.
- Total distance spat by Zoey = \(40 \times 10 = 400\) feet.

Next, calculate the total distance spat by Sydney:
- Sydney has 35 seeds and each seed is spat 12 feet.
- Total distance spat by Sydney = \(35 \times 12 = 420\) feet.

Now, find the combined total distance spat by both:
- Combined total distance = \(400 + 420 = 820\) feet.

To find the average total distance spat, divide the combined total distance by the number of participants (2):
- Average total distance = \(\frac{820}{2} = 410\) feet.

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"First, let's calculate the number of widgets each machine produces in a month.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
- Widgets per hour: 60
- Hours per day: 24
- Days per month: 30

Total widgets produced by the Widgeteer 3000 in a month:
\[ 60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 43,200 \text{ widgets} \]

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
- Widgets per hour: 45
- Hours per day: 24
- Days per month: 30

Total widgets produced by the WidgetMaster 9000 in a month:
\[ 45 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 32,400 \text{ widgets} \]

Next, we calculate the revenue from selling these widgets. Each widget sells for $6.

Revenue from the Widgeteer 3000:
\[ 43,200 \text{ widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$259,200 \]

Revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[ 32,400 \text{ widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$194,400 \]

Finally, we find the difference in revenue between the two machines:
\[ \$259,200 - \$194,400 = \$64,800 \]

Therefore, Fern will make \(\boxed{64800}\) dollars more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"First, let's determine the total number of hours Cameron will stay at the hotel. Cameron arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning. This means he will stay for 17 hours.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the stay based on the hotel's pricing structure. The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours and 70 pesos for every additional hour after that.

1. The cost for the first 12 hours is 1000 pesos.
2. The number of additional hours after the first 12 hours is \(17 - 12 = 5\) hours.
3. The cost for these additional 5 hours is \(5 \times 70 = 350\) pesos.

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay is:
\[1000 + 350 = 1350 \text{ pesos}\]

Now, let's calculate the cost if Cameron had paid for a 24-hour stay. The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

The amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour plus additional hours option is:
\[1600 - 1350 = 250 \text{ pesos}\]

Therefore, Cameron would save \(\boxed{250}\) pesos."
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, we calculate the hay needed for each sheep as follows:

\[ 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we calculate the total hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:

\[ 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total amount of hay Nate needs is:

\[ \boxed{159} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much John earned in the week. He earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to account for the expenses. John spends $50 on gas, so his remaining money is:
\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John also wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so after the deposit, he will have:
\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to subtract the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs $10 and he buys 5 pencils, so the total cost for the pencils is:
\[ 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} \times 5 \text{ pencils} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the pencils, the remaining money is:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many $25 pens he can buy with the remaining $100. The number of pens he can buy is:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ dollars}}{25 \text{ dollars/pen}} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled out. Craig has spelled out 20 words, each with 15 letters. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig has spelled is:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled. According to the problem, Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled is:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

Now, we add the total number of letters spelled by Craig and his brother to find the total number of letters spelled after the ten rounds:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

Thus, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

\[ \boxed{650} \]"
"To determine the total number of children participating in the mass drill, we need to calculate the number of children from each school and then sum them up.

Each school has 7 rows, with 8 children in each row. Therefore, the number of children in one row is 8, and the number of rows per school is 7. So, the number of children per school is:

\[ 8 \text{ children/row} \times 7 \text{ rows/school} = 56 \text{ children/school} \]

Since there are 5 different schools, the total number of children is:

\[ 56 \text{ children/school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 280 \text{ children} \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the drill is:

\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming all her coupons. Since each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice and the teacher has 9 coupons, the total number of bottles is:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the teacher has \(\boxed{842}\) bottles of apple juice for herself."
"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing job, we need to consider the following components:

1. **Visit Charge**: $40
2. **Labor Charge**: $35 per hour, or part thereof, for 2.25 hours. Since the charge is per hour or part thereof, we round up 2.25 hours to 3 hours (as partial hours are charged as full hours). Therefore, the labor charge is $35 * 3 = $105.
3. **Parts Charge**: $60

Now, we sum these charges:

\[
\text{Total Charge} = \text{Visit Charge} + \text{Labor Charge} + \text{Parts Charge}
\]

\[
\text{Total Charge} = 40 + 105 + 60 = 205
\]

Therefore, the total charge for the job is $205."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount:

\[ 10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.40 \times \$150 = \$60 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:

\[ \$150 - \$60 = \$90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each:

\[ 5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40 \text{ per CD} = \$200 \]

Now, we need to determine how much money James was out after selling 5 of the CDs. The amount he was out initially was $90, and he received $200 from selling 5 CDs. Therefore, the net amount he was out is:

\[ \$90 - \$200 = -\$110 \]

Since the question asks how much money he was out, and the negative value indicates he gained money, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"To determine how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of root crop and then sum them up.

   - Price per yam: $1.5
   - Total earnings from yams: \( 6 \times 1.5 = 9 \) dollars

2. **Sweet Potatoes:**
   - Number of sweet potatoes: 10
   - Price per sweet potato: $2
   - Total earnings from sweet potatoes: \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \) dollars

3. **Carrots:**
   - Number of carrots: 4
   - Price per carrot: $1.25
   - Total earnings from carrots: \( 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \) dollars

"First, let's calculate the distance James swims before resting. He swims 60% of the 20-mile lake:

\[ 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes to swim this distance. Since he swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

After swimming, he rests for half as long as the swimming time:

\[ \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, he swims the remaining distance. The remaining distance is:

\[ 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

He swims the remaining distance at half his original speed, which is 1 mile per hour:

\[ \text{Time to swim 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we add up all the times to find the total time to get across the lake:

\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:

\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many loaves of bread the bakery has based on the information given.

1. Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday.
2. The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday.

To find seven times the number of loaves Sam had:
\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]

Next, we subtract 40 from this number to find the number of loaves the bakery has:
\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \]

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

450"

Therefore, at the end, Jasmine has 13 stickers."
"First, let's calculate the commission Cayley earns from the New York Times sales:

- Each New York Times costs $5.
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy.
- Therefore, the commission per copy of the New York Times is \( 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \) dollars.

Cayley sells 6 copies of the New York Times, so the total commission from the New York Times is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the commission Cayley earns from the Wall Street Journal sales:

- Each Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy.
- Therefore, the commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is \( 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \) dollars.

Cayley sells 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal, so the total commission from the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the commissions from both newspapers to find the total commission:
\[ 3 + 12 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

\[ 21 \times 2 = 42 \text{ years old} \]

So, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \) (total points scored by the team)
2. \( B = A + 20 \) (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)
3. \( B = D + 10 \) (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) in the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 25 \) back to find \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \( 5 \) points.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the number of pages in the book, we need to follow these steps:

   \[
   100 \text{ pages/side} \times 2 \text{ sides} = 200 \text{ pages/inch}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of pages in the book**: Given that the book is 1.5 inches thick, the total number of pages is:
   \[
   200 \text{ pages/inch} \times 1.5 \text{ inches} = 300 \text{ pages}
   \]

Therefore, the book has 300 pages."
"First, let's determine the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and ended at 11:00 PM.

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we need to convert this time into minutes because Vince's stapling rate is given in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes, we divide:

\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:

\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep, excluding the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Usual Sleep Duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - The total sleep duration is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours.
   - Converting 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Time Kim Was Sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is \(2:38 - 2:15 = 23\) minutes.

3. **Time Kim Was Awake Before Her Usual Wake-Up Time:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.
   - The time from 6 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 5 minutes.

4. **Total Time Kim Was Not Asleep:**
   - Total time not asleep includes the time she was sleepwalking and the time she was awake before her usual wake-up time.
   - Total time not asleep: \(23 + 5 = 28\) minutes.

5. **Time Kim Actually Slept:**
   - Subtract the time not asleep from the usual sleep duration.

"Initially, the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds. With 1/5 of the beds occupied, the number of occupied beds is:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \text{ beds} \]

Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds initially is:

\[ 1000 - 200 = 800 \text{ beds} \]

Over the course of 2 weeks (14 days), 50 patients are admitted each day. The total number of new admissions over 2 weeks is:

\[ 50 \times 14 = 700 \text{ patients} \]

After these admissions, the total number of occupied beds will be:

\[ 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ beds} \]

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we calculate the age of Shawna's father, who is five times as old as Shawna:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"If Courtney overstated the number of people by 20%, we can set up the following relationship to find the actual number of attendees.

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people who attended the concert. According to Kelly, Courtney's reported number (48) is 120% of the actual number of attendees (since 100% + 20% = 120%).

So, we can write the equation:
\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \), we get:
\[ J = 1 \]

Now, substituting \( J = 1 \) back into the expression for the total number of balls:
\[ 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes by the end of the third day after filling in two holes.
3. Use the information that the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes

Total holes dug by the end of the third day before filling in any holes:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 \]

After filling in 2 holes:
\[ 31 - 2 = 29 \]

By the end of the third day, there are 29 holes. According to the problem, by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day is 10. Therefore, the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

The number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the number of holes by the end of the fourth day and the number of holes by the end of the third day:

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets for travel. The tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The cost of the supplies is $400.

To find 50% of $400:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the total cost of the tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Now, we add the cost of the supplies and the cost of the tickets to find the total travel cost:
\[ 400 + 600 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the total travel cost is:
\[ \boxed{1000} \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \).

According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe. So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan, \( S \), can be expressed as:
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokemon caught by Alex, \( X \), can be expressed as:
\[ X = S + 5 = (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \]

The total number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe is 339. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ X + S + A = 339 \]
Substituting the expressions for \( X \) and \( S \) in terms of \( A \), we get:
\[ (4A - 8) + (4A - 13) + A = 339 \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]
Adding 21 to both sides of the equation, we get:
\[ 9A = 360 \]
Dividing both sides by 9, we get:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we can find the number of Pokemon caught by Stan:
\[ S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is:
\[ \boxed{147} \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of episodes in the show. According to the problem, there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, the number of episodes is:

\[
\frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

Next, we calculate the total time John will spend watching the show by multiplying the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

\[
10 \text{ episodes} \times 20 \text{ minutes per episode} = 200 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the total time John will spend watching the show is:

\[
200 \text{ minutes}
\]"
"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: North
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Next, we calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction by subtracting the distance traveled north from the distance traveled south.

- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \)
- Total distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \)

Net distance traveled south: \( 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \)

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \(\boxed{374}\) miles."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Greta made 1 dozen (12) cream cheese swirl brownies.
2. At her office party, she received an additional 1/2 dozen (6) brownies.
3. When she arrived home, there were 4 dozen (48) brownies waiting for her.
4. During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten.

Now, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had:

- Brownies made by Greta: 12
- Brownies received from the office party: 6
- Brownies received from the surprise party: 48

Total brownies before the surprise party: 
\[ 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \]

Next, we subtract the brownies eaten during the surprise party:

- Brownies eaten: 18

Total brownies left over:
\[ 66 - 18 = 48 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"Nani is 8 years old.

Nani's brother is twice Nani's age, so:
\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ years old} \]

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find 25% of Nani's age:
\[ 8 \times 0.25 = 2 \text{ years} \]

So, Nani's sister is:
\[ 8 - 2 = 6 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we add up the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister:
\[ 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \]

The total age of all three family members is:
\[ 30 \]"

   - Total time: \(5 \times 22 = 110\) minutes

3. **Hybrid Sets:**
   - Number of racquets: 4
   - Time per racquet: 18 minutes
   - Total time: \(4 \times 18 = 72\) minutes

Now, we sum the total times for each type of stringing:
\[45 + 110 + 72 = 227\]

Therefore, the total time it will take Andy to restring all the racquets is \(\boxed{227}\) minutes."
"John needs to buy 4 phones in total (1 for himself, 1 for his wife, and 1 for each of his 2 kids).

The first two phones are at full price, which is $600 each. So, the cost for the first two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 600 = 1200 \]

The remaining two phones are at half price, which is $300 each. So, the cost for the last two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 300 = 600 \]

Adding the costs together, the total amount John paid for all the phones is:
\[ 1200 + 600 = 1800 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

So, Zeke's team has 20 players.

Next, we find the total number of players in both teams combined by adding the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

\[ 13 + 20 = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is:

\[ \boxed{33} \]"
"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially bought:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave away:
\[ 2 \text{ boxes to her mom} + 2 \text{ boxes to her sister} = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtract the boxes given away from the total number of boxes:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} - 4 \text{ boxes} = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining boxes:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 \text{ boxes} = 2 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtract the boxes she kept from the remaining boxes to find out how many boxes she sold:
\[ 8 \text{ boxes} - 2 \text{ boxes} = 6 \text{ boxes} \]

Since each box contains 20 oranges, we calculate the total number of oranges she sold:
\[ 6 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges/box} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Therefore, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is:
\[ 120 \]"
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of states in India} = \frac{x}{2} + 4 \]

The total number of states in both countries together is:
\[ x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \). Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is:
\[ 79 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy:

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Next, we need to determine how much more money Tyler needs to buy the books. He has already saved $14, so the additional amount needed is:

$39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide the total amount needed by his hourly wage:

$25 ÷ $5/hour = 5 hours

Therefore, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books.

5"
"First, let's determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard and Robert has 30 cherries, Richard has:

\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \text{ cherries} \]

Next, we know the total number of cherries is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the number of cherries that Richard and Robert have from the total:

\[ 60 - (30 + 20) = 60 - 50 = 10 \text{ cherries} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries, so the difference is:

\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Therefore, Robert has \(\boxed{20}\) more cherries than Jerry."
"First, let's determine the number of boxes Sunny sold on each day.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 4 fewer boxes than on Sunday

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 5 more boxes than on Saturday
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Calculate the number of boxes sold on Sunday:
- Gingerbread: \(10 + 5 = 15\) boxes
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Now, calculate the total number of boxes sold on each day:
- **Saturday:**
  - Gingerbread: 10 boxes
  - Apple pie: \(10 - 4 = 6\) boxes
  - Total: \(10 + 6 = 16\) boxes

- **Sunday:**
  - Gingerbread: 15 boxes
  - Apple pie: 15 boxes
  - Total: \(15 + 15 = 30\) boxes

Next, calculate the earnings from each type of baked good:
- **Gingerbread:**
  - Saturday: \(10 \times 6 = 60\) dollars
  - Sunday: \(15 \times 6 = 90\) dollars
  - Total: \(60 + 90 = 150\) dollars

- **Apple pie:**
  - Saturday: \(6 \times 15 = 90\) dollars
  - Sunday: \(15 \times 15 = 225\) dollars
  - Total: \(90 + 225 = 315\) dollars

Finally, add the earnings from both types of baked goods to find the total earnings for the two days:
\[150 + 315 = 465\]

Thus, Sunny earned a total of \(\boxed{465}\) dollars for the two days."
"Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour she is outside. If she is outside for 4 hours a day, she will use:

\[ 1 \, \text{ounce/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours/day} = 4 \, \text{ounces/day} \]

Over 8 days, the total amount of sunscreen she will use is:

\[ 4 \, \text{ounces/day} \times 8 \, \text{days} = 32 \, \text{ounces} \]

Since each bottle contains 8 ounces of sunscreen, the number of bottles she will need is:

\[ \frac{32 \, \text{ounces}}{8 \, \text{ounces/bottle}} = 4 \, \text{bottles} \]

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"The price of the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. Since the blue car costs $100, we calculate 40% of $100 to find the discount on the red car.

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \]

So, the red car costs $40 less than the blue car.

\[ \text{Price of the red car} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Now, we add the prices of both cars to find the total cost.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 100 + 60 = 160 \]

The total cost of both cars is $160."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is currently 19 years old.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years from now.
3. At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old.
4. At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be \(24 \div 2 = 12\) years old.

Now, let's determine the current ages of Emil's dad and brother:

- Emil's dad will be 48 years old in 5 years, so his current age is \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.
- Emil's brother will be 12 years old in 5 years, so his current age is \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother is \(43 + 7 = 50\).

Therefore, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is \(\boxed{50}\)."

Adrianne's friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ beads} \]

To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we add the beads from her mother, sister, and friend:
\[ 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, Adrianne has a total of 90 beads."
"First, let's determine the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day.

- On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
- On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) pounds.

Next, we sum the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[3 \text{ pounds (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ pounds (Friday)} + 6 \text{ pounds (Saturday)} = 21 \text{ pounds}\]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we divide the total pounds of crawfish by 3 to find the number of servings:
\[\frac{21 \text{ pounds}}{3 \text{ pounds/serving}} = 7 \text{ servings}\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{7}

"First, let's determine how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after accounting for the football players:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ students} \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We calculate this as follows:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \text{ students} \]

Now, we add the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members to find the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 \text{ (football players)} + 6 \text{ (cheerleaders and band members)} = 12 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is:

"First, determine the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's and Sophie wears size five boots, Charlie's boots are:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Next, calculate the average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie. The average is found by adding the sizes together and then dividing by the number of people:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{5 + 25}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

So, the average size of shoe worn by the two is:

\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the width of the plants and the spacing are given in feet and inches, we'll convert everything to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 12 inches is 1 foot.

Each plant, including the space between it and the next plant, takes up 1 foot + 1.5 feet = 2.5 feet.

The total length of the flower bed is 111 feet. To find out how many plants can fit, we divide the total length by the space each plant needs:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:

\[ 44 - 17 = 27 \text{ plants} \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost is:

\[ 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"Edgar's brother eats \(\frac{1}{2}\) as many pretzels as Edgar. Since Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, his brother eats:

\[ 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ pretzels} \]

**63**"
"First, let's calculate the cost for one hanging basket:

- Each basket will have 3 petunias, and each petunia costs $3.00. So, the cost for petunias in one basket is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dollars.
- Each basket will also have 2 sweet potato vines, and each sweet potato vine costs $2.50. So, the cost for sweet potato vines in one basket is \(2 \times 2.50 = 5\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total cost for one basket is \(9 + 5 = 14\) dollars.

Since Katherine has 5 hanging baskets, the total cost for all baskets is \(5 \times 14 = 70\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is \(\boxed{70}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. Since they plant 4 sunflowers, the total soil used for sunflowers is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. Since they plant 10 carnations, the total soil used for carnations is \(10 \times 1.5 = 15\) pounds.

Next, we add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations to find the total soil used for these flowers:
\[12 + 15 = 27\] pounds.

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. Therefore, the amount of soil left for planting roses is:
\[30 - 27 = 3\] pounds.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[3 \div 1 = 3\].

So, they can plant \(\boxed{3}\) roses."
"First, we need to determine how much Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times 2000 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much she can spend on shoes each month. Since she sets aside $500.00 each month for shoes, and each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, we need to determine how many pairs she can buy each month.

\[ \text{Number of pairs per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \text{ pairs} \]

Since she can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0.5 pairs per month, which means she can buy 1 pair every 2 months.

Now, we need to find out how many pairs she can buy in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

\[ \text{Number of pairs per year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months per pair}} = 6 \text{ pairs} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time required for Emily to both peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp:
- Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
- To peel 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{6} = 15 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to sauté 90 shrimp:
- Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- To sauté 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{30} \times 10 = 3 \times 10 = 30 \) minutes.

Since the peeling and sautering are sequential tasks, we add the time for both tasks:
- Total time = Time to peel + Time to sauté = 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

45 minutes"
"Let's break down the cooling and warming process step by step.

1. **Cooling on Low for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 3 hours, the room cools by \(2 \times 3 = 6\) degrees.

2. **Cooling on High for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at 3 degrees per hour.
   - After 4 hours, the room cools by \(3 \times 4 = 12\) degrees.

3. **Warming for 2 hours:**
   - The room warms up at 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 2 hours, the room warms by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:
- Initial cooling: \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.
- Final warming: \(-4\) degrees.

The net change in temperature is \(18 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - Let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet as \( x \).

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - According to the problem, Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. So, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \( 3x \).

3. **Calculate the time between the two sightings:**
   - Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time between the two sightings is 75 years. Therefore, the difference in age between Bill and his dad when they both saw the comet is 75 years.
   - This means \( 3x - x = 75 \).

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   3x - x = 75
   \]
   \[
   2x = 75
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{75}{2} = 37.5
   \]
   - So, Bill's dad was 37.5 years old when he saw the comet.

5. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was \( 3x = 3 \times 37.5 = 112.5 \) years old, and the time between the two sightings is 75 years, we can find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 112.5.
   \[
   112.5 - 75 = 37.5
   \]

Therefore, Bill was 37.5 years old when he saw the comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the frequency of each type of check and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

2. **Gas bill**: Similarly, he writes one check per month for the gas bill, which also results in:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

3. **Church**: Buford writes two checks per month to the church. Over a year, this amounts to:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ checks}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service**: He writes one check every quarter (3 months) to the pest and lawn service. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, he writes:
   \[
   1 \times 4 = 4 \text{ checks}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52 \text{ checks}
\]

Therefore, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is:
\[
52

"Let's denote the number of flights the first plane makes in one day as \( F \).

According to the problem, the second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, we can write:
\[ 44 = \frac{F}{2} \]
Solving for \( F \):
\[ F = 44 \times 2 = 88 \]

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \]

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The remaining flights are:
\[ 88 - 66 = 22 \]
Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is:
\[ \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl:

1. **Tobias's howl**: 20 seconds.
2. **Chikote's howl**: Twice as long as Tobias's howl, so \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds.
3. **Igneous's howl**: The combined length of Tobias's and Chikote's howls, so \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Next, we calculate the total combined length of their howls in seconds:
\[ 20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[ \frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Adam received from his father. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, and his mother gave him $6, his father gave him:

\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the money given by his mother and father to find the total amount of money Adam received from them:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Adam's trousers cost $30. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount of money he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Adam had to contribute \(\boxed{12}\) dollars from his savings."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \( A \), \( B \), \( H \), and \( W \) respectively. We are given the following information:

1. \( A = 3 \) (Akbar's age)
2. \( B = 4 \) (Alessandro's age)
3. The total age of the children is 20, so \( A + B + H + W = 20 \).
4. Helene's age \( H \) is twice the average age of the group.

First, we can express the total age equation as:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we use the information about Helene's age being twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene's age is twice this average:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, substituting \( H = 10 \) into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, we need to determine the total amount of money collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund. The amount collected from his neighbors is $500, and the amount collected from the online fund is $1500. Adding these together gives:

\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute. The lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. The total amount donated by everyone else is $2000. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution is:

\[ 3 \times 2000 = 6000 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6000} \]"
"First, calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies per guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, determine how many cookies were given to the church next door:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 1500 \text{ cookies} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

If each person in the church next door received 15 cookies, then the number of people in the church next door can be calculated as:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies per person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ 50 \]"
"Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Therefore, each adult's slice will be \( 2x \).

Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is \( 2 + 4 = 6 \).

The total size of the watermelon can be represented as the sum of all the slices:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

The size of each adult's slice is \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of each adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets \( 25\% \) of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on inpatient rounds. Since he has 9 inpatients and it takes 20 minutes per inpatient, the total time for rounds is:

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes/inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the appointments. He has 10 appointments, each taking 30 minutes:

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes/appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 480 minutes to hours:

\[ 480 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic. Subtracting the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments from the total time at the clinic gives us the time left for updating records:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to work backwards from the time she wants to serve it, which is 5:00 pm.

1. **Frosting the cake**: 10 minutes
2. **Cooling the cake**: 2 hours
3. **Baking the cake**: 30 minutes
4. **Making the cake batter**: 20 minutes

Let's add up the total time required for each step:
- Cooling: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Baking: 30 minutes
- Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
- Frosting: 10 minutes

Total time required = 120 + 30 + 20 + 10 = 180 minutes

Convert 180 minutes into hours:
180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm to find the latest start time:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm."
"To determine how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter:**
   - Lisa sold \(3.5\) boxes.
   - Peter sold \(4.5\) boxes.
   - Total boxes sold = \(3.5 + 4.5 = 8\) boxes.

2. **Determine the total number of chocolate bars sold:**
   - They sold a total of \(64\) chocolate bars.

3. **Calculate the number of chocolate bars per box:**
   - Number of chocolate bars per box = Total chocolate bars / Total boxes
   - Number of chocolate bars per box = \(64 / 8 = 8\)

Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in a box is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost per session for the dance studio. The cost per session includes a fixed cost of $25 for renting the studio plus a variable cost of $1.50 per student per session.

For 10 students, the variable cost per session is:
\[ 10 \text{ students} \times \$1.50 \text{ per student} = \$15 \]

So, the total cost per session is:
\[ \$25 + \$15 = \$40 \]

The dance studio is rented 3 days a week. Therefore, the weekly cost is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times \$40 \text{ per day} = \$120 \]

Assuming there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly cost is:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times \$120 \text{ per week} = \$480 \]

Thus, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are:
\[ \$480 \]"
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( p \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( m \).

From the problem, we know:
- Peter has 4 boxes, and the total number of chocolate bars he has is 64. Therefore, we can write the equation:
  \[
  4p = 64
  \]
- Martha has 7 boxes, and the total number of chocolate bars she has is 56. Therefore, we can write the equation:
  \[
  7m = 56
  \]

First, we solve for \( p \):
\[
4p = 64 \implies p = \frac{64}{4} = 16
\]

Next, we solve for \( m \):
\[
7m = 56 \implies m = \frac{56}{7} = 8
\]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:
\[
p - m = 16 - 8 = 8
\]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the total population of porcupines is 50 and the number of female porcupines is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

Next, we need to find out how many porcupine babies are born each month. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the total number of babies born each month is:

\[
\text{Number of babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[
\text{Number of babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
\]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. Adding the number of babies born in a year to the initial population gives us the total number of porcupines in the park after a year:

\[
\text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1490}
\]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the swimming pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, so we use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

So, the volume of the pool is:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

Calculating the volume step by step:

\[ 25 \times 14 = 350 \]
\[ 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

The volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet. According to the pool company's instructions, we need to multiply the volume by 5.9 to find out how many gallons of water are needed:

\[ \text{Gallons of water needed} = 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of blue sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, and there are 9 red sticks, the number of blue sticks is:
\[ 9 + 5 = 14 \]

Next, we need to find the number of yellow sticks. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Since there are 14 blue sticks, the number of yellow sticks is:
\[ 14 - 3 = 11 \]

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:
\[ 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 \]

Therefore, the total number of sticks is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"To determine how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

The formula to calculate distance is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

For Shandy:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we find the difference in the distances traveled by Shandy and Matteo:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."

   \]

3. **Male students over 16 years old**: 
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 1500 = 375
   \]

4. **Female students over 16 years old**: 
   \[
   1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

5. **Students under 16 years old**: 
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = 1500
   \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old**: 
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 1500 = 750
   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old**: 
   \[
   1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total number of female students**: 
   \[
   1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is \(\boxed{1875}\)."
"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run in one hour.

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps in one hour.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps in one hour.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps in one hour.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps. Therefore, Bethany can run \(10 - 5 = 5\) more laps than Quinn.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:**
   - The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons.
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   \[
   \text{Total water pumped on the first day} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount of water pumped on the second day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the second day:**

"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park as \( x \).

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. Therefore, the charge remaining after 5 hours can be calculated as:
\[ x \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = x \times (0.91)^5 \]

After 5 hours, the power bank continues to lose 7% of its charge each hour. So, the charge remaining after the next 3 hours can be calculated as:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, or 0.28. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

First, we calculate the values of \( (0.91)^5 \) and \( (0.93)^3 \):
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357 \]

Now, we multiply these values together:
\[ 0.624032 \times 0.804357 \approx 0.5018 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ x \times 0.5018 = 0.28 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.5018} \approx 0.5578 \]

Rounding to two decimal places, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park was approximately 55.78%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was \(\boxed{55.78\%}\)."
"First, let's calculate Janet's total earnings per hour from both wages and tips:

\[ \text{Hourly wage} = \$10 \]
\[ \text{Hourly tips} = \$15 \]
\[ \text{Total hourly earnings} = \$10 + \$15 = \$25 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Janet wants to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car:

\[ \text{Down payment} = 20\% \times \$10,000 = 0.20 \times \$10,000 = \$2,000 \]

Now, we calculate how much Janet earns in a week if she works 40 hours:

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = \$25 \times 40 = \$1,000 \]

To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\$2,000}{\$1,000} = 2 \]

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jamaar has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: \(2 \times 1 = 2.00\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the items already purchased:
\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount he has is:
\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy \(\boxed{3}\) plums."
"First, we calculate the total number of sweets Anne has:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack contains 60 pieces, so the total number of pieces given to her friends is:

\[ 13 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Since she gave these 780 pieces to 10 friends equally, the number of pieces each friend received is:

\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

Therefore, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply a 5% increase each year to the original price of $120.

1. **First Year:**
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 120 + (0.05 \times 120) = 120 + 6 = 126
   \]

2. **Second Year:**
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 126 + (0.05 \times 126) = 126 + 6.3 = 132.3
   \]

3. **Third Year:**
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 132.3 + (0.05 \times 132.3) = 132.3 + 6.615 = 138.915
   \]

Rounding $138.915 to the nearest integer, we get $139.

**Final Answer:**

"Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

- 24 guests elected for an early checkout, so the number of guests decreased by 24.
- 15 guests elected for a late checkout, so the number of guests decreased by 15.
- In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice that number is \(2 \times 15 = 30\) guests who checked in.
- After dinner, 7 more people checked in.

Let's calculate the number of guests step by step:

1. Initial number of guests: 100
2. Guests after early checkout: \(100 - 24 = 76\)
3. Guests after late checkout: \(76 - 15 = 61\)
4. Guests after afternoon check-in: \(61 + 30 = 91\)
5. Guests after dinner check-in: \(91 + 7 = 98\)

The final number of guests in the hotel is 98."

John has 22 bananas."
"First, let's break down the total number of questions and categorize them:

- Total number of questions: 60
- Percentage of easy questions: 40%
- Number of easy questions: \( 60 \times 0.40 = 24 \)
- Number of average and difficult questions combined: \( 60 - 24 = 36 \)
- Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided, the number of average questions is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \), and the number of difficult questions is also 18.

Next, we calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct in each category:

- Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct:
  \[
  24 \times 0.75 = 18
  \]
- Aries is sure to get half of the average questions correct:
  \[
  18 \times 0.50 = 9

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (L \times x) + (S \times 2x) \]
Substituting the values of \( L \) and \( S \):
\[ 120 = (12 \times x) + (4 \times 2x) \]
\[ 120 = 12x + 8x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

So, the number of large stuffed animals sold is 6. Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first need to calculate the daily consumption and then multiply by 7 (the number of days in a week).

1. The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
2. The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
3. The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

First, calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the family:
\[ 5 \text{ (man)} + 4 \text{ (wife)} + 2 \text{ (son)} = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Next, calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten in one week:
\[ 11 \text{ sandwiches/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 77 \text{ sandwiches/week} \]

Therefore, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$300 \]"
"The Easter egg hunt team hid a total of 100 eggs. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found:

\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

This means the number of eggs left to be found by their friends is:

\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \text{ eggs} \]

However, it is stated that all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. Therefore, the number of eggs found by their friends is:

\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

So, the friends found:

\[ \boxed{30} \] eggs."
"First, let's determine the amount of ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day. We know that:

- A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
- With an iron pickaxe, a dwarf can mine twice as much, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
- With a steel pickaxe, a dwarf can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which is \(24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36\) pounds per day.

Now, we need to calculate how much ore 40 dwarves can mine with steel pickaxes in a month with 30 days. The amount of ore mined by one dwarf in a day with a steel pickaxe is 36 pounds. Therefore, the amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves in one day is:

\[40 \times 36 = 1440 \text{ pounds}\]

Since there are 30 days in the month, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves in a month is:

\[1440 \times 30 = 43200 \text{ pounds}\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{43200}
\]"
"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich for each package and then use that to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

First, let's calculate the price per sandwich for the first package:
- The first package contains 2 sandwiches for $3.
- Therefore, the price per sandwich is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the price per sandwich for the second package:
- The second package contains 4 sandwiches for $6.
- Therefore, the price per sandwich is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) dollars.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is consistent across all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.50.

Now, we can find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
- If each sandwich costs $1.50, then 8 sandwiches will cost \( 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \) dollars.

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."
"First, we need to determine the remaining amount Tom needs to pay after selling his old bedroom set. He buys a new bedroom set for $3000 and sells his old one for $1000. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:

\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining $2000 each month. To find out how much he needs to pay per month, we calculate 10% of $2000:

\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, Tom has to pay \(\boxed{200}\) dollars per month."
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst due to the wind.

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.40 \times 25 = 10 \]

So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving her with:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of her 12 yellow balloons:

\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

So, she was left with:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

As she neared the school, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons. First, we calculate 75% of the 8 blue balloons:

\[ 75\% \text{ of } 8 = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \]

Adding these 6 blue balloons to her remaining 15 red and 6 yellow balloons, the total number of balloons she carried into the school is:

\[ 15 + 6 + 6 = 27 \]

So, the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is:

\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Probability of having a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework:**
   - Probability = 50% or 0.50

2. **Probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving everyone an extension:**
   - Probability = 40% or 0.40

3. **Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension but Marcus still getting a personal extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension = 60% (100% - 40%) or 0.60
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension = 20% or 0.20
   - Combined probability = 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12

Now, we sum these probabilities to find the total probability that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework:

\[ 0.50 + 0.40 + 0.12 = 0.92 \]

This means there is a 92% chance that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework. Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:

\[ 100\% - 92\% = 8\% \]

**Final Answer:**
8%"
"First, we need to determine the total number of seats already allocated for graduates and faculty. This is calculated as follows:

\[ 950 \text{ (seats for graduates)} + 300 \text{ (seats for faculty)} = 1250 \text{ seats} \]

Next, we subtract the allocated seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center to find out how many seats are available for the guests:

\[ 6000 \text{ (total seats)} - 1250 \text{ (allocated seats)} = 4750 \text{ seats} \]

These 4750 seats are to be split equally among the 950 graduates. Therefore, we divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family. 

**Final Answer:**
5"
"To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish the relationships between the different sizes of jelly beans and then use these relationships to find the answer.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large jelly beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium jelly beans Grandpa can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium jelly beans}
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium jelly bean.
   - Therefore, the number of small jelly beans equivalent to 150 medium jelly beans is:
     \[
     3 \times 150 = 450 \text{ small jelly beans}
     \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, calculate the total amount Melissa is paid for her jury duty:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, calculate the total parking expenses:
\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the parking expenses from the total pay to find the net pay:
\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, calculate the net pay per hour:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

So, Melissa makes \(\boxed{2}\) dollars per hour after expenses."
"Ted spends $16 \times 3 = \$48$ on books and $6 \times 3 = \$18$ on pencils.

"First, we need to determine how many soda bottles Richard will place on the driveway. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and he places a bottle every 3 feet. This means the number of bottles is calculated by dividing the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle and then adding 1 (since he starts at the first bottle and places one at the beginning):

\[
\text{Number of bottles} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total time it takes for Richard to place the candy in each bottle. Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next, and he needs to do this 8 times (from the first to the second, second to the third, and so on until the eighth to the ninth), the total time is:

\[
\text{Total time} = 8 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

\[
\boxed{40}

"First, let's calculate the total amount of loans Jim takes out during his 4 years of college:
\[ 50,000 \text{ dollars/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 200,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine Jim's income before and after college. Before college, he earned $25,000 per year. After earning his degree, his income tripled:
\[ 25,000 \text{ dollars/year} \times 3 = 75,000 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Now, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college. Since he would have worked for 4 years at $25,000 per year:
\[ 25,000 \text{ dollars/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 100,000 \text{ dollars} \]

After college, Jim's annual income is $75,000. We need to find out how long it will take for him to earn the equivalent of the $200,000 in loans plus the $100,000 in lost income:
\[ 200,000 \text{ dollars} + 100,000 \text{ dollars} = 300,000 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how many years it will take for Jim to earn $300,000 at an annual income of $75,000, we divide the total amount by his annual income:
\[ \frac{300,000 \text{ dollars}}{75,000 \text{ dollars/year}} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it would take Jim \(\boxed{4}\) years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"First, let's determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces Jim needs. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ \text{Total area} = 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total amount of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{160} \] square feet."
"First, let's calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. One-fifth of the letters delivered on Monday is:

\[ \frac{425}{5} = 85 \]

Then, on Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than this amount:

\[ 85 + 17 = 102 \]

Next, we calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. Twice the amount delivered on Tuesday is:

\[ 2 \times 102 = 204 \]

Then, on Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than this amount:

\[ 204 + 5 = 209 \]

Now, we sum the letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:

\[ 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.
   - Loss in the first race: \( -5 \) dollars.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race: \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) dollars.
   - Winning amount in the second race: \( 10 + 1 = 11 \) dollars.
   - Gain in the second race: \( +11 \) dollars.

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Loss in the third race: \( 1.5 \times 11 = 16.5 \) dollars.
   - Loss in the third race: \( -16.5 \) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount won or lost:

- Total loss: \( -5 + (-16.5) = -21.5 \) dollars.
- Total gain: \( +11 \) dollars.

Net total amount:
\[ -21.5 + 11 = -10.5 \] dollars.

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total net loss by the number of races (3):

\[ \text{Average loss per race} = \frac{-10.5}{3} = -3.5 \] dollars.

So, the average loss per race is \( -3.5 \) dollars.

**Final numerical answer:**
\[

"To find the total population of South America based on the given information, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of cities in South America.
2. Calculate the total population by multiplying the number of cities by the number of people living in each city.

First, we know there are 26 countries in South America. Each country has 5 cities. Therefore, the total number of cities in South America is:
\[ 26 \text{ countries} \times 5 \text{ cities per country} = 130 \text{ cities} \]

Next, each city has 1000 people living in it. So, the total population of South America is:
\[ 130 \text{ cities} \times 1000 \text{ people per city} = 130,000 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the total population of South America, based on the given conditions, is:

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. We'll use inches for consistency.

Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's original height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
After growing 3 inches, Xavier's current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches. So, Cole's current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( \boxed{420} \)."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of days the painters worked:**
   - The team worked for 3 weeks.

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[
2 \cdot 2x + 2 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} = 2 \cdot 19
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year.

The formula for the value of an asset after depreciation is:
\[ \text{Value} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Here, the initial value is $20000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years is 3 (from 2007 to 2010).

Let's calculate the value step by step:

1. Calculate the depreciation factor: \(1 - 0.21 = 0.79\).
2. Apply this factor for 3 years: \(20000 \times 0.79^3\).

Now, let's compute \(0.79^3\):
\[ 0.79^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039 \]

So, the value of the car in 2010 is:
\[ 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9860.78} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of books written in English. Since half of the 50 books are in English, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Next, we calculate the number of books written in German. Since 10% of the books are in German, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of German books} = 10\% \times 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5 \]

Now, to find the number of books written in Spanish, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (\text{Number of English books} + \text{Number of German books}) \]
\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (25 + 5) = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of Spanish books is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we first need to calculate the total distance she has already driven. According to the problem, Bernice drove 325 kilometers each day for 4 days. 

The total distance driven so far is:
\[ 325 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 1300 \text{ km} \]

The total distance from San Diego to New York City is approximately 1955 kilometers. To find out how many kilometers she still needs to drive, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance:
\[ 1955 \text{ km} - 1300 \text{ km} = 655 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, Bernice still needs to drive:
\[ \boxed{655} \text{ kilometers} \]"
"Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Over 30 days, she would drink:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, the number of gallons she drinks in 30 days is:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."

\[ 190 - 80 = 110 \]

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is:
\[ 110 \]"
"First, let's break down the costs of each item Alison bought:

1. **Tank top**: $10
2. **Running shorts**: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. **Tennis shoes**: Originally $48, but on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. **Athletic socks**: Package originally $8, with a $2 coupon, so $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$10 + \$15 + \$24 + \$6 \]

"To determine the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of tiles needed:**
   - Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}\).
   - The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
   - Therefore, the number of tiles needed is \(200 \text{ SqFt} \div 1 \text{ SqFt/tile} = 200 \text{ tiles}\).

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each tile costs $12.
   - The total cost is \(200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12/\text{tile} = \$2400\).

The total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is \(\$2400\)."

- 1 king size bed every week

Since he changes the sheets every week, in a year (52 weeks), he will use:
- \(4 \text{ twin beds} \times 52 \text{ weeks} = 208 \text{ twin sheets}\)
- \(1 \text{ king bed} \times 52 \text{ weeks} = 52 \text{ king sheets}\)

Next, we need to determine how many loads of laundry he needs to do. The laundry machine can handle:
- 2 twin sets of sheets at a time
- 1 king set of sheets at a time

For the twin sheets:
- \(208 \text{ twin sheets} \div 2 \text{ twin sheets per load} = 104 \text{ loads}\)

For the king sheets:
- \(52 \text{ king sheets} \div 1 \text{ king sheet per load} = 52 \text{ loads}\)

Adding these together gives the total number of loads of laundry:
- \(104 \text{ loads} + 52 \text{ loads} = 156 \text{ loads}\)

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
156"
"First, let's break down the number of movies watched each day:

- On Saturday, they watch 4 movies.
- On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) movies.

So, in one weekend (Saturday and Sunday), they watch a total of \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) movies.

Now, to find out how many movies they watch in 4 weeks, we multiply the number of movies watched in one weekend by 4:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Therefore, in 4 weeks, they can watch 24 movies."
"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, he collected 50 stickers. So, the total number of stickers he had at the beginning of this year is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as last year. So, the number of stickers he collected this year is:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the total number of stickers in his collection now is:
\[ 150 + 100 = 250 \]

Leo has 250 stickers in his collection."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's cats consume in one day. Since she feeds them twice a day with 60 grams each time, the daily consumption is:

\[ 60 \, \text{grams/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 120 \, \text{grams/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:

\[ \frac{720 \, \text{grams}}{120 \, \text{grams/day}} = 6 \, \text{days} \]

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 6 days."
"First, let's determine how many slices Jake ate. Since Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Becky's slices} = \text{Jake's slices} + 3 \]

Given that Becky ate 10 slices:

\[ 10 = \text{Jake's slices} + 3 \]

Solving for Jake's slices:

\[ \text{Jake's slices} = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Next, we know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Therefore:

\[ \text{Silvia's slices} = 2 \times \text{Jake's slices} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:

\[ \text{Total slices} = \text{Becky's slices} + \text{Jake's slices} + \text{Silvia's slices} = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \]

Therefore, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, we can express Betsy's part as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for the meal is the sum of both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:
\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part is 18 minutes longer, we calculate:
\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long."
"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to break down each component of the charges:

1. **Cast**: $200
2. **Doctor's Visit**: The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost for the visit is:
   \[
   \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Painkillers**: The cost per pill is $4, and she needs 30 pills, so the total cost for the painkillers is:
   \[
   4 \times 30 = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Parking**: The doctor charges $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours, so the cost for parking is:
   \[
   6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up all these costs:
\[
200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total cost of the doctor's visit is:
\[
\boxed{482}

"First, we need to determine how many emails James receives in a day that require a response. Since 20% of the emails don't require any response, 80% of the emails do require a response.

The number of emails that require a response each day is:
\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \]

Next, we need to find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week. We multiply the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:
\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

Therefore, the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week is:
\[ \boxed{320} \]"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes for each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: 32 classes visited.
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes.
3. **Wednesday**: Three times as many as Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes.
4. **Thursday**: 30 classes visited.
5. **Friday**: 25 classes visited.

Now, we sum the number of classes for each day:

\[
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25
\]

First, add 32 and 64:

\[
32 + 64 = 96
\]

Next, add 96 and 96:

\[
96 + 96 = 192
\]

Then, add 192 and 30:

\[
192 + 30 = 222
\]

Finally, add 222 and 25:

\[

"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we first need to calculate the total score for all tests and then divide by the number of tests.

1. John's score for the first 3 tests: \(100 + 100 + 100 = 300\)
2. John's score for the 4th test: \(80\)
3. Total score for all 4 tests: \(300 + 80 = 380\)
4. Number of tests: \(4\)
5. Average score: \(\frac{380}{4} = 95\)

Therefore, John's average score across the 4 tests is \(95\)."
"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate and how many are left.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the glee club is:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ate and how many are left.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]
The football team ate 80% of the pizzas they ordered:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the football team is:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas} \]

Now, we add the remaining pizzas from both the glee club and the football team to find the total number of pizzas left:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, the final number of pizzas left is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each type of coupon Anthony is sending out.

Anthony is sending out 700 small coupons. Since he wants to send out twice as many big coupons, the number of big coupons is:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:
\[ 24500 \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:
\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ meatball sub sandwiches} \]

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So, the number of meatball sub sandwiches remaining after Mark ate is:

\[ 7 - 4 = 3 \text{ meatball sub sandwiches} \]

Then, Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches. The total number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney has now is:

\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \text{ meatball sub sandwiches} \]

Since each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{24} \]"
"First, we need to determine the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures. Since a quarter of the 20 trucks had mechanical failures, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks}
\]

This means that 5 trucks could not deliver their load. Therefore, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[
20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks}
\]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[
15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ tons}
\]

Thus, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:

\[
300 \text{ tons}

"Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. Since he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The promotion at the grocery store is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter he buys, he gets the next half pound at a discount.

To calculate the cost, we need to determine how many full pounds and half pounds he will get with the promotion for 6 pounds of butter.

1. For every 1.5 pounds of butter (1 pound at full price and 0.5 pound at half price), the cost is:
   - Full pound: $4.00
   - Half pound at half price: $4.00 * 0.5 = $2.00
   - Total cost for 1.5 pounds: $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00

2. Since Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, we can calculate how many sets of 1.5 pounds he will get:
   - 6 pounds / 1.5 pounds per set = 4 sets

3. The total cost for 4 sets is:
   - 4 sets * $6.00 per set = $24.00

Therefore, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter with the promotion is $24.00."
"First, let's determine the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- Classmates: 25
- Dance class members: 7
- Family members: 13

Total invited guests = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Since 4 people said they could not come, the number of guests who will attend is:

45 - 4 = 41

The cost to rent the theater is $125, and there is an additional $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20. The number of additional guests is:

41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is:

21 * $6 = $126

Adding the rental fee and the additional guest fee gives:

$125 + $126 = $251

Therefore, the total cost of the party is:

$251"
"First, let's determine how much money Maggie and Riza each had initially.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has three-quarters of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times \text{Maggie's initial money} = 60
\]
Solving for Maggie's initial money:
\[
\text{Maggie's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
\]

Similarly, Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has two-thirds of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times \text{Riza's initial money} = 60
\]
Solving for Riza's initial money:
\[
\text{Riza's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
\]

Now, let's calculate how much money each of them spent:
- Maggie spent:
\[
80 - 60 = 20
\]
- Riza spent:
\[
90 - 60 = 30
\]

The total amount of money they have left is:
\[
60 + 60 = 120
\]

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's determine the total number of bananas each monkey eats in a week.

Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas for a week, which is 7 days. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by the three monkeys in a week is 315.

Next, we calculate the daily banana consumption for each monkey.

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.

Now, we calculate the total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a week:
- The first monkey eats \(10 \times 7 = 70\) bananas in a week.
- The second monkey eats \(14 \times 7 = 98\) bananas in a week.

Adding these together, the first and second monkeys together eat \(70 + 98 = 168\) bananas in a week.

Since the total number of bananas is 315, the third monkey eats the remaining bananas:
\[ 315 - 168 = 147 \text{ bananas in a week} \]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide the weekly consumption by 7:
\[ \frac{147}{7} = 21 \]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

Final answer:
21"

"First, let's calculate the total cost of 15 roses. Since roses cost $2 each, the total cost is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which amounts to:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she needs an additional $5 to cover the cost. The florist can only give change in quarters. Since 1 quarter is $0.25, we need to find out how many quarters make up $5:

\[ \$5 \div \$0.25/\text{quarter} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 20 quarters. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 20 \]"

"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has saved is:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to reach her goal of 200 toothpicks. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of toothpicks she already has from the total number she needs:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, we can determine how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks by dividing the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie \(\boxed{8}\) more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price.

Original price of the watch = $2000

Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for = 75% of $2000
\[ = 0.75 \times 2000 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for = 120% of $1500
\[ = 1.20 \times 1500 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price of the watch.

The original price of the watch = $2000
The price Mr. Rogers' friend paid = $1800

Discount = Original price - Price paid by friend
\[ = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

Percentage discount = \(\frac{\text{Discount}}{\text{Original price}} \times 100\)
\[ = \frac{200}{2000} \times 100 = 10\% \]

Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is \(\boxed{10\%}\)."
"To determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, a single spring creates 1 jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - 1 hour = 3600 seconds
   - 4 hours = 4 × 3600 = 14400 seconds

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since one spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, in 14400 seconds, one spring will create 14400 jellyfish.

4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create 5 × 14400 jellyfish.

5. **Final calculation:**

"James walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles, and then walked back home, another 2 miles, before realizing he forgot something. He then walked the 2 miles back to the store.

The total distance James walked is:
\[ 2 \text{ miles (to halfway point)} + 2 \text{ miles (back home)} + 2 \text{ miles (to the store)} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Given that James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, the time it took him to walk 6 miles is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it took James 1.5 hours to reach the store."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from buying 10 bunches. Since each bunch averages 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we calculate the cost if Jenny bought these bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80, so the total cost for 40 bananas is:

\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since she bought 10 bunches and each bunch costs $3.00, the total cost is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:

\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the following equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ 20 \]"
"To determine how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. Therefore, the growth rate per year is:

\[ \text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \]

Next, we use this growth rate to find out how much the crocodile will grow in 13 years:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow \(\boxed{26}\) inches in 13 years."
"First, let's determine the number of each type of bike sold.

1. **Trekking Bikes:**
   - Half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes.
   - Number of Trekking bikes = \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \).

2. **BMX Bikes:**
   - 15% of the 300 bikes sold were BMX bikes.
   - Number of BMX bikes = \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \).

3. **MTB Bikes:**
   - The rest of the bikes sold were MTB bikes.
   - Number of MTB bikes = Total bikes - Trekking bikes - BMX bikes
   - Number of MTB bikes = \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \).

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike.

1. **Earnings from Trekking Bikes:**
   - Price of one Trekking bike = $450.
   - Total earnings from Trekking bikes = \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \).

2. **Earnings from BMX Bikes:**
   - Price of one BMX bike = \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \).
   - Total earnings from BMX bikes = \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \).

3. **Earnings from MTB Bikes:**
   - Price of one MTB bike = $500.
   - Total earnings from MTB bikes = \( 105 \times 500 = 52500 \).

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes to find the total earnings.

- Total earnings = Earnings from Trekking bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from MTB bikes
- Total earnings = \( 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = 131250 \).

Therefore, Marcel earned \(\boxed{131250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."
"The farmer makes 5 bales per hour and works for 6 hours, so the total number of bales made is:
\[ 5 \, \text{bales/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{bales} \]

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour and works for 6 hours, so the total number of bales picked up is:
\[ 3 \, \text{bales/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 18 \, \text{bales} \]

The number of bales left in the field is the total number of bales made minus the total number of bales picked up:
\[ 30 \, \text{bales} - 18 \, \text{bales} = 12 \, \text{bales} \]

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of minutes John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long.

\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes} \]

John spends these 320 minutes each weekday. Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total time spent in classes during the weekdays is:

\[ 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 1600 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly class time on these days.

\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time spent learning in a week is the sum of the time spent in classes and the extra learning time:

\[ 1600 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 1700 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{1700 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = \frac{1700}{60} \approx 28.33 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends learning each week is:

\[ \boxed{28.33} \]"
"First, we need to determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the initial height is:

\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the height to which the ball bounces on its first bounce. The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height, so the height after the first bounce is:

\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find out how high the ball bounces on its second bounce. Again, the ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce, so the height after the second bounce is:

\[ 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height to which the ball bounces on its second bounce is:

\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, let's convert the height of the first child from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is \(6 \times 12 = 72\) inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is \(72 + 2 = 74\) inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is \(74 - 5 = 69\) inches.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is \(69 + 3 = 72\) inches.

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is 72 inches."
"To determine how much the orchard earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bags sold.
2. Multiply the number of bags by the price per bag.

First, we find out how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples by 10:

\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags}
\]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which means \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

1080"
"First, calculate the area of the north and south walls:
- Each wall is 10 feet by 8 feet, so the area of one wall is \(10 \times 8 = 80\) square feet.
- Since there are two walls, the total area for the north and south walls is \(80 \times 2 = 160\) square feet.

Next, calculate the area of the east and west walls:
- Each wall is 5 feet by 8 feet, so the area of one wall is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) square feet.
- Since there are two walls, the total area for the east and west walls is \(40 \times 2 = 80\) square feet.

Now, add the areas of all four walls to get the total area to be painted:
- Total area = \(160 + 80 = 240\) square feet.

Next, determine how many gallons of paint are needed:
- One gallon covers 20 square feet, so the number of gallons needed is \(\frac{240}{20} = 12\) gallons.

Finally, calculate the total cost:
- Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost is \(12 \times 12 = 144\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{144}
\]"
"First, let's determine the initial state of the sodas:
- Total sodas: 12
- Shaken sodas: 3
- Unshaken sodas: 12 - 3 = 9

Ellen took 1 unshaken soda for herself, so the remaining sodas are:
- Shaken sodas: 3
- Unshaken sodas: 9 - 1 = 8

Ellen's brother then took 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas, so the remaining sodas are:
- Shaken sodas: 3 - 1 = 2
- Unshaken sodas: 8 - 2 = 6

Now, Ellen's friend comes along and takes 1 soda. We need to find the probability that the soda taken by Ellen's friend is shaken.

The total number of sodas left is:
2 (shaken) + 6 (unshaken) = 8

The probability that the soda taken by Ellen's friend is shaken is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas:
\[ \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this probability as a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is:
\[ 25\% \]"
"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train travels and then sum these distances.

1. The first train travels at 60 miles per hour.
2. The second train travels at half the speed of the first train, which is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles per hour.

Next, we calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours:
- Distance traveled by the first train: \( 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \).
- Distance traveled by the second train: \( 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \).

Adding these distances together gives the total distance between the two trains after 3 hours:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the two trains are 270 miles apart after 3 hours."
"First, let's determine the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.

- March has 31 days.
- From March 1st to March 31st, there are 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.

So, the total number of days is:
\[ 31 + 19 = 50 \text{ days} \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of days Billy takes off, which is 20% of the total days:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the number of days Billy works is:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ days} \]

Billy can help 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day. So, the number of people he helps per day is:
\[ 2 \text{ people/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 6 \text{ people/day} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of people he helps over the 40 days:
\[ 6 \text{ people/day} \times 40 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ people} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry.

First, let's calculate the number of people that the buses could carry:
- There were 12 buses.
- Each bus carried 35 people.

\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people/bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of people that the cars could carry:
- There were 20 cars.
- Each car carried 3 people.

\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people/car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Now, we add the number of people from the buses and the cars to find the total number of people:

\[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the total number of people inside the church is:

\[ \boxed{480} \]"
"To determine Jeff's age, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. Mike's age is given as 24 years.
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike. Therefore, Martha's age is:
   \[
   24 - 4 = 20 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. Therefore, Jeff's age is:
   \[
   20 + 10 = 30 \text{ years}
   \]

So, Jeff is 30 years old."
"To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each slide and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the biggest slide:
- The length of the biggest slide is 300 feet.
- The speed is 60 feet per minute.

The time to slide down the biggest slide is:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} = \frac{\text{Length}_{\text{biggest}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{biggest}}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the second biggest slide:
- The length of the second biggest slide is 240 feet.
- The speed is 80 feet per minute.

The time to slide down the second biggest slide is:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = \frac{\text{Length}_{\text{second biggest}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{second biggest}}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} - \text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"First, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks each day.

- Lunch: 30 minutes
- Breaks: 2 breaks × 15 minutes each = 30 minutes

So, the total time spent on lunch and breaks each day is:
30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, Bobby spends 1 hour each day on lunch and breaks.

Over 5 days, the total time spent on lunch and breaks is:
1 hour/day × 5 days = 5 hours

Therefore, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours."
"First, let's determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we calculate Micah's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (\text{Amber's distance} + \text{Micah's distance}) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (8 + 28) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - 36 \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"First, let's calculate the initial balance after the return:

1. Initial charge: $85.00
2. Cost of returned item: $15.00

\[ \text{Balance after return} = 85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan after the 20% discount:

3. Original price of frying pan: $20.00
4. Discount on frying pan: 20% of $20.00

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 0.20 \times 20.00 = 4.00 \]
\[ \text{Price after discount} = 20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the set of towels after the 10% discount:

5. Original price of towels: $30.00
6. Discount on towels: 10% of $30.00

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 0.10 \times 30.00 = 3.00 \]
\[ \text{Price after discount} = 30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00 \]

Finally, let's add the costs of the frying pan and the set of towels to the balance after the return:

7. Balance after return: $70.00
8. Cost of frying pan: $16.00
9. Cost of set of towels: $27.00

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is:
\[ \frac{J}{5} \]

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15} \]

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{J}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation:
\[ J = 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

Thus, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is:

Next, we calculate Caroline's age. Since Caroline is three times older than Ben, and Ben is 8 years old, we calculate Caroline's age as follows:

\[ \text{Caroline's age} = 3 \times \text{Ben's age} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old."
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs for her retirement and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount given her current savings rate.

1. **Calculate the total retirement savings needed:**
   - Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   - Her current annual salary is $100,000.
   - Therefore, the annual retirement income needed is \( 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000 \) dollars.
   - For a retirement period of 20 years, the total savings needed is \( 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the amount Lauren saves each year:**
   - Lauren saves 20% of her annual salary.
   - Her current annual salary is $100,000.
   - Therefore, the amount saved each year is \( 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the number of years needed to save the total amount:**
   - The total amount needed is $800,000.
   - The amount saved each year is $20,000.
   - The number of years required to save $800,000 is \( \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \) years.

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for an additional 40 years to save enough for her retirement."
"First, we need to determine the length of each of the 4 equal parts of the ribbon. Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon, and he needs to divide it into 4 equal parts. So, we divide 100 by 4:

\[ \frac{100}{4} = 25 \text{ centimeters} \]

Each of these 25 centimeter parts is then divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we divide 25 by 5:

\[ \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ centimeters} \]

So, the length of each final cut will be:

"First, let's determine the total population of the school. We know that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. We can set up the following equation to find the total population (P):

\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To solve for \( P \), we divide both sides by 0.40:

\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

So, the total population of the school is 600.

Next, we need to find out how many girls are in the school. Since 40% of the population are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. We calculate 60% of the total population:

\[ 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360.

Final numerical answer:
360"

After buying more fish, Tate has:
- 4 + 2 = 6 male guppies
- 7 + 1 = 8 female guppies
- 3 + 2 = 5 male goldfishes
- 5 + 3 = 8 female goldfishes

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes = 6 (guppies) + 5 (goldfishes) = 11
- Total female fishes = 8 (guppies) + 8 (goldfishes) = 16

The difference between the number of female and male fishes is:
- 16 (female) - 11 (male) = 5

Therefore, Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes.

"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores.

1. **Amalia's time:**
   - Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

2. **Megan's time:**
   - Megan's chore took 2 hours longer than Amalia's.
   - Therefore, Megan's time = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours.

3. **Dior's time:**
   - Dior's chore took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia's.
   - Therefore, Dior's time = 4 hours + 4 hours + 1 hour (since it's ""well over 4 hours longer"") = 9 hours.

Now, we sum up the time each person took to complete their chores:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Amalia's time} + \text{Megan's time} + \text{Dior's time}
\]

\[
\text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 9 \text{ hours} = 19 \text{ hours}

Thus, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is \boxed{19} hours."
"First, let's calculate the one-way distance John drives to visit his parents. Since he drives at a speed of 70 mph and it takes him 2 hours for one way, the distance can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

\[ \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Since this is a round trip, we need to double this distance:

\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

John visits his parents twice a month, so the total distance he drives in a month is:

"Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. Over 7 days, she will walk:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, the distance Brian will walk in 7 days is:

\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days."
"First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers.

The first two workers produce 6 toys per hour each. Therefore, together they produce:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ toys per hour} \]

The next two workers produce 4 toys per hour each. Therefore, together they produce:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ toys per hour} \]

Adding these together, the first four workers produce:
\[ 12 + 8 = 20 \text{ toys per hour} \]

Since they work for 10 hours, the total number of toys produced by the first four workers is:
\[ 20 \text{ toys per hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The total order is 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. This means that the first four workers have produced:
\[ 400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys} \]

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[ 380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys} \]

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys per hour} \]

Therefore, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"First, let's determine the weight of each of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds.

1. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we add the weights of all three dogs to find the total weight:
\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog}
\]
\[
\text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is:
\[
\boxed{105}

"Let's work backwards from the information given:

1. **Rob received 7 stickers from Kris.** This means Kris had \(7 + 9 = 16\) stickers before giving 7 to Rob.
2. **Kris had 16 stickers, which is half of what Luis gave her.** Therefore, Luis gave Kris \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.
3. **Luis used half of the stickers he received from Seth and gave the rest to Kris.** This means the 32 stickers Luis gave to Kris were half of what he received from Seth. Therefore, Seth gave Luis \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

So, Seth originally had **64 stickers**."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of M&M that John has:

"To determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate half of the circumference of the earth.
2. Determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly that distance.

First, the circumference of the earth is given as 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Next, we know that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies per day:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the speed of the fastest car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use the speed of the 2nd fastest car to find the speed of the fastest car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. Therefore, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
\[ 120 \text{ mph} \times 5 = 600 \text{ mph} \]

Next, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is:
\[ 600 \text{ mph} \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ mph} \]

So, the speed of the fastest car is:
\[ \boxed{750} \text{ mph} \]"
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old. Therefore, Vince is now 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

Vince is now 9 years old."
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as \(A\), by Madeline as \(M\), by Camden as \(C\), and by Sarah as \(S\).

From the problem, we know:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \(A = M\).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \(C + S = 30\).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah: \(C = S + 12\).

First, we can substitute the third equation into the second equation to find \(S\):
\[C + S = 30\]
\[(S + 12) + S = 30\]
\[2S + 12 = 30\]
\[2S = 18\]
\[S = 9\]

Now, we can find \(C\):
\[C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21\]

Next, we know the total number of eggs painted is 56:
\[A + M + C + S = 56\]
Since \(A = M\), we can substitute \(M\) with \(A\):
\[A + A + 21 + 9 = 56\]
\[2A + 30 = 56\]
\[2A = 26\]
\[A = 13\]

Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[C - A = 21 - 13 = 8\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}

"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Since each group of crayons will be placed in a box, Nik will need 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. Therefore, the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

The total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight in pounds is:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's determine how much of the tree can be used to make logs. John can make logs out of 80% of the 80-foot tree:

"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns $5000 per month and this is half of what her brother earns, her brother earns:

\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we calculate their combined salary. Valerie earns $5000 and her brother earns $10000, so together they earn:

\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns:

\[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we add up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother to find the total amount of money they all have together:

\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all have together is:

\[ \boxed{45000} \]"
"First, let's determine Grandma's walking speed on the beach. Since she spends 40 minutes walking 2 miles on the beach, her speed on the beach is:

\[ \text{Speed on beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:

\[ \text{Speed on sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:

\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = 1 \text{ mile} \times 10 \text{ minutes per mile} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:

\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, we calculate the total amount Jane has saved so far. She has been saving $4 every week for 8 weeks. Therefore, the total amount saved is:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach a total of $60. We subtract the amount she has already saved from $60:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jane saves $4 each week, we need to determine how many weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28. We do this by dividing the remaining amount by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane \(\boxed{7}\) more weeks to save a total of $60."

"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob originally has.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. Therefore, the equation to find the original number of marbles Bob has is:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtract 24 from both sides to find the original number of marbles:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, the number of marbles he will have is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug, let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. After mixing, the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees, which is the minimum temperature Donny can drink.

Let's calculate the temperature of the mixture in the bottle. The total volume of water in the bottle is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces. The total heat content of the mixture can be calculated as follows:

- Heat content from the 33-degree water: \( 4 \times 33 = 132 \) degree-ounces.
- Heat content from the \( T \)-degree water: \( 1 \times T = T \) degree-ounces.

The average temperature of the mixture is given by the total heat content divided by the total volume:

\[
\text{Average temperature} = \frac{132 + T}{5}
\]

We know that this average temperature must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

To find \( T \), we solve the inequality:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after mixing.

\[
\boxed{68}

1. **Initial number of animals:**
   - Cows: 50
   - Chickens: 20

2. **Number of days in three weeks:**
   - 3 weeks = 3 × 7 days = 21 days

3. **Cows added per day:**
   - 20 cows/day

4. **Total cows added in 21 days:**
   - 20 cows/day × 21 days = 420 cows

5. **Chickens added per day:**
   - 10 chickens/day

6. **Total chickens added in 21 days:**
   - 10 chickens/day × 21 days = 210 chickens

7. **Total number of cows after three weeks:**
   - Initial cows + Cows added = 50 + 420 = 470 cows

8. **Total number of chickens after three weeks:**
   - Initial chickens + Chickens added = 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

9. **Total number of animals on the farm:**
   - Total cows + Total chickens = 470 + 230 = 700 animals

"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels before the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, so for 4 packs:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pack} = \$40.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost. A 10% discount means Russell pays 90% of the original cost:

\[ \$40.00 \times 0.90 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total. Since each pack contains 9 bagels and he orders 4 packs:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, to find the cost per single bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:

\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \text{ per bagel} \]

So, the cost per single bagel is:

\[ \$1.00 \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of scoops Gomer ate:**
   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops.
   - This can be calculated as: \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops.

2. **Determine the number of scoops per potato:**
   - It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops.
   - This can be broken down as:
     - 3 less than 6 potatoes: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes.
     - 1 less than 3 scoops: \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops.
   - Therefore, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops.
   - To find out how many potatoes are needed for 1 scoop, we divide the number of potatoes by the number of scoops: \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) potatoes per scoop.

3. **Calculate the total number of potatoes Gomer ate:**
   - Gomer ate 18 scoops.
   - Using the rate of 1.5 potatoes per scoop, the total number of potatoes is: \( 18 \times 1.5 = 27 \) potatoes.

"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of eggs for 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the following equation to find the number of men and women:

Let the number of men be \(5x\) and the number of women be \(9x\). The total number of passengers is the sum of men and women, so we have:
\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
\[x = \frac{84}{14} = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:
\[ \text{Number of men} = 5x = 5 \times 6 = 30 \]
\[ \text{Number of women} = 9x = 9 \times 6 = 54 \]

If 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

"To find the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket.
2. Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners.

First, let's find the probability of winning for the second ticket. The problem states that the second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Since the first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, the second ticket has a probability of \(3 \times 20\% = 60\%\).

Next, we need to find the combined probability that both tickets are winners. Since the events are independent, we multiply the probabilities of each event happening:

\[
0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is \(\boxed{12\%}\)."
"First, let's determine how many seashells Carlos collected. Since Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected, we can set up the equation for Carlos's seashells as follows:

\[ \text{Carlos's seashells} = 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. So, we can set up the equation for Carrey's seashells as follows:

\[ \text{Carrey's seashells} = \frac{\text{Carlos's seashells}}{2} = \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

Now, we can find the total number of seashells collected by adding the seashells collected by each person:

\[ \text{Total seashells} = \text{Jim's seashells} + \text{Carlos's seashells} + \text{Carrey's seashells} = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \]

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, each person gets:

\[ \text{Seashells per person} = \frac{\text{Total seashells}}{3} = \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

Therefore, each person gets \(\boxed{20}\) seashells."
"Mason eats 4 carrots each day on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays, so he eats \(4 \times 5 = 20\) carrots from Monday to Friday.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, he eats \(5 \times 2 = 10\) carrots on the weekend.

Adding the carrots from weekdays and the weekend, Mason eats \(20 + 10 = 30\) carrots a week.

"The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes = 0.60 * 5 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes long.

Now, we add the lengths of both songs to get the total length of the cassette:

5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes

The total cassette time is 13 minutes."
"First, let's determine the selling price of one mobile device. Linus buys each device for $20 and sells it for twice the original price. Therefore, the selling price of one device is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the profit from selling one device. The profit per device is the selling price minus the buying price:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, so the total number of devices he bought is:

\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ devices} \]

The total profit from selling all 6 devices is the profit per device multiplied by the total number of devices:

\[ 20 \times 6 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total profit Linus earned after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's determine the height of Ned. Since Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, and Isabel is 7 feet tall, Ned's height is:

\[ 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we find Carl's height. Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so Carl's height is:

\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet} \]

Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of Carl's cane is \(\boxed{3}\) feet."
"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would need to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily energy demand for 2300 people:**
   - Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
   - Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, Hortex would need to produce \( \frac{100\%}{20\%} = 5 \) bottles of juice per person.

2. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed for 2300 people:**
   - For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required is \( 2300 \times 5 = 11500 \) bottles.

3. **Determine the current production capacity:**
   - Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles of juice per day.

4. **Calculate the additional number of bottles needed:**
   - The additional number of bottles required is \( 11500 - 4200 = 7300 \) bottles.

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce an additional 7300 bottles of juices to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people."
"First, let's determine the number of octuplets dressed in each color. Since Carla has 8 identical octuplets:

- 3/4 of them are dressed in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \) octuplets.
- 1/4 of them are dressed in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \) octuplets.

Next, we need to find out how many of the blue-wearers and purple-wearers also wear bows:

- All 2 blue-wearers wear bows.
- 1/3 of the 6 purple-wearers wear bows: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) purple-wearers.

So, the total number of octuplets wearing bows is \( 2 + 2 = 4 \).

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. Out of the 4 bow-wearers, 2 are purple-wearers. Therefore, the probability is:

\[ \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is \( \boxed{50\%} \)."
"To find out how many tax reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of tax reports received over the week.
2. Subtract the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total.
3. Subtract the number of reports received on Thursday and Friday from the remaining total.

Let's start with the total number of tax reports received over the week:
\[ 5168 \]

Next, subtract the reports received on Monday and Tuesday:
\[ 5168 - 1907 = 3261 \]

Then, subtract the reports received on Thursday and Friday:
\[ 3261 - 2136 = 1125 \]

So, the number of reports received on Wednesday is:
\[ 1125 \]

Therefore, the number of reports received on Wednesday is:

"First, let's determine how much land Abraham sold in the first transaction. He sold half of his 80 square meters of land:

\[
\frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ square meters}
\]

He sold this 40 square meters for $50. Next, he sold another 1/4 of his original land. Since the original land is 80 square meters, 1/4 of it is:

\[
\frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ square meters}
\]

He sold these 20 square meters for $30. Now, let's calculate the remaining land after these two sales. Initially, he had 80 square meters. After selling 40 square meters, he had:

\[
80 - 40 = 40 \text{ square meters}
\]

After selling another 20 square meters, he had:

\[
40 - 20 = 20 \text{ square meters}
\]

He then sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter. The money earned from selling the remaining land is:

\[
20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add up all the money he earned from selling the land:

\[
50 + 30 + 60 = 140 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is:

\[
\boxed{140}

"First, we need to find half of Haley's age. Haley is 26 years old, so half of her age is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \).

Next, we need to find Geb's age, which is 10 less than half of Haley's age. So, we subtract 10 from 13:

\[ 13 - 10 = 3 \]

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old. 

Geb's age is 3."
"Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. If he goes out three times a day, the number of face masks he uses per day is calculated as follows:

\[ 2 \text{ masks/go} \times 3 \text{ go/day} = 6 \text{ masks/day} \]

For 2 days, the total number of face masks he uses is:

\[ 6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks} \]

Therefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"Cole initially hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen eggs equal \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

To find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we need to subtract the total number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei from the initial number of eggs.

The total number of eggs found is \(5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\).

Therefore, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is \(36 - 27 = 9\).

"First, let's determine the number of apartments in the third complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have:

\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. Therefore, the number of apartments in the third complex is:

\[ 400 + 0.60 \times 400 = 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of apartments in all three complexes:

\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:

\[ 1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections} \]

He gets paid $0.40 per collection. Therefore, the total amount of money he makes in a week is:

\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1248} \]"
"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   3 \times 50 = 150 \text{ fruits}
   \]
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   7 \times 50 = 350 \text{ fruits}
   \]
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   20 \times 50 = 1000 \text{ fruits}
   \]

Next, we need to find out how many fruits the 8-year-old tree produces. According to the problem, an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits:
\[
1000 - 200 = 800 \text{ fruits}
\]

Now, we sum up the fruits produced each year:
\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000
\]

Adding these together:
\[
50 + 150 = 200
\]
\[
200 + 350 = 550
\]
\[
550 + 800 = 1350
\]
\[
1350 + 0 = 1350
\]
\[
1350 + 1000 = 2350

\[ \text{Total amount Jack has now} = 100 + 20 = 120 \]

So, Jack now has $120."
"Let's define the lengths of the ropes with variables:
- Let \( R \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, substitute \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation:
\[ R = 4B \]
\[ B = Y - 7 \]
\[ R = 4(Y - 7) \]

Now substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]

Simplify and solve for \( Y \):
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now, find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

The length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters.

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters."
"First, let's determine how much money Rissa was given. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with:

\[ 15 - x \]

According to the problem, after giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, Rissa gave $3 to her little sister. Since Ronnie gave the same amount to his little sister, he also gave $3. Therefore, the amount of money left with Ronnie is:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Given that the mural uses 12 pints of paint in total and that half of the mural is yellow, we can determine the amount of yellow paint used first. Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is:

\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

This leaves the other half of the mural to be painted with red, white, and purple paint. Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we can denote the amount of each as \( x \). Therefore, the total amount of red, white, and purple paint is:

\[ x + x + x = 3x \]

Since the total amount of paint used for red, white, and purple is the other half of the mural, it is also 6 pints. Thus, we have:

\[ 3x = 6 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{6}{3} = 2 \]

So, the amount of red paint used is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, calculate the area of one bedroom:

\[ \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \, \text{square feet} = 1200 \, \text{square feet} \]

Now, calculate the total area of the 4 bedrooms:
\[ \text{Total area of 4 bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \, \text{square feet} = 960 \, \text{square feet} \]

Add the area of the living room and the rest of the house to find the total area of the house:
\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 1200 \, \text{square feet} + 960 \, \text{square feet} + 1000 \, \text{square feet} = 3160 \, \text{square feet} \]

The total area of the house is:

"To determine the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of puffs for each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
2. **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Monday, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the puffs from each day:
\[ 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 \]

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]
\[ 9 + 12 = 21 \]
\[ 21 + 24 = 45 \]
\[ 45 + 48 = 93 \]

So, the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday is \(\boxed{93}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of pods in the special size box. The regular box contains 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods.

\[ 100 \text{ pods} + 20\% \text{ of } 100 \text{ pods} = 100 + 0.20 \times 100 = 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. To find the cost per pod in the special size box, we divide the total cost by the number of pods:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Since the cost per pod is $0.10, the number of pods you can get for $1 is:

\[ \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}} = 10 \text{ pods} \]

If you use 1 pod per cycle, then with $1, you can run:

\[ 10 \text{ cycles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's determine how many 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdraws. Since he withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills} \]

Next, Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. So, the number of bills he has left is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills} \]

He then uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. So, the number of bills he uses is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills} \]

This means the number of bills he has left after paying for the bill is:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills} \]

Thomas then triples his money. Since he has 20 bills left, the total amount of money he has is:

\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

Tripling this amount gives:

\[ 400 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, he converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. The number of 5 dollar bills he has is:

\[ \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{240} \]"

"To determine how many days the teacher can use the chalk before it needs to be recycled, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
   - He used 45% of the chalk on Monday.
   - Remaining chalk after Monday = \( 5 \times (1 - 0.45) = 5 \times 0.55 = 2.75 \) inches.

2. **Determine the daily usage:**
   - The teacher conserves chalk and uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.
   - Daily usage = 20% of the remaining chalk.

3. **Calculate the remaining chalk each day:**
   - Day 1 (Tuesday): 
     - Remaining chalk = \( 2.75 \times (1 - 0.20) = 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \) inches.
   - Day 2 (Wednesday):
     - Remaining chalk = \( 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \) inches.

"Let's define the current ages of Wendy and Colin as \( W \) and \( C \) respectively.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

First, we can simplify the first equation:
\[
W = 5(C + 7) \implies W = 5C + 35
\]

Next, we substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]

Distribute the 3 on the left side:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

Rearrange the equation to isolate \( C \):
\[
75 - 35 = 5C - 3C
\]
\[
40 = 2C
\]
\[
C = 20
\]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of 50 kg bags required to deliver 850 kg of coal.
2. Multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag.

First, we calculate the number of 50 kg bags needed:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's order is:
\[ \boxed{306} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed by Kate's 6 friends:

Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices, so for 6 friends:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ cheese slices} \]

Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we need to determine how many whole cheese pizzas are required:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ cheese slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed by Kate's 6 friends:

Each friend eats 4 pepperoni pizza slices, so for 6 friends:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ pepperoni slices} \]

Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to determine how many whole pepperoni pizzas are required:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ pepperoni slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} \]

Therefore, Kate needs to buy:
\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizza pies} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran each day.

- On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So, for these three days, the total is \(3 \text{ miles/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles}\).
- On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So, for these two days, the total is \(5 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ miles}\).

Adding these totals together gives us the total miles Sam ran this week:
\[9 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 19 \text{ miles}\]

So, Sam ran 19 miles this week."
"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of building snowballs:**
   - Jay builds 20 snowballs in 1 hour (60 minutes).

2. **Rate of melting snowballs:**
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - In 1 hour (60 minutes), the number of 15-minute intervals is \( \frac{60}{15} = 4 \).
   - Therefore, in 1 hour, 2 snowballs melt 4 times, which means \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) snowballs melt in 1 hour.

3. **Net rate of snowball accumulation:**
   - Jay builds 20 snowballs but loses 8 snowballs due to melting.
   - Net rate of snowball accumulation = \( 20 - 8 = 12 \) snowballs per hour.

4. **Time to accumulate 60 snowballs:**
   - To find the time required to have 60 snowballs, we use the net rate of 12 snowballs per hour.
   - Time required = \( \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \).

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Jim's current age based on the information given.

1. Let's denote John's current age as \( J \) and Jim's current age as \( M \).
2. We know that John is currently 28 years old, so \( J = 28 \).
3. We also know that 20 years ago, John was twice as old as Jim. So, 20 years ago, John's age was \( J - 20 \) and Jim's age was \( M - 20 \).
4. According to the problem, \( J - 20 = 2 \times (M - 20) \).

Now, substitute \( J = 28 \) into the equation:
\[ 28 - 20 = 2 \times (M - 20) \]
\[ 8 = 2 \times (M - 20) \]
\[ 8 = 2M - 40 \]
\[ 8 + 40 = 2M \]
\[ 48 = 2M \]
\[ M = \frac{48}{2} \]
\[ M = 24 \]

So, Jim is currently 24 years old.

**Final Answer:**
Jim is 24 years old."
"Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find the total number of slices they all ate, we add the slices together:
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

Therefore, they all ate a total of 6 slices of apple."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 1 bulk pack = 50
   - Bandages at the end of the first day: \(50 - 38 = 12\)

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: \(38 - 10 = 28\)
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \(12 - 28 = -16\)
   - Since the number of bandages cannot be negative, this means they ran out of bandages and needed to order more. They ordered enough to cover the deficit and the usage for the day. So, they ordered \(28 - 12 = 16\) bandages to cover the deficit and the usage for the second day. Therefore, at the end of the second day, they had \(16 - 28 = -12\), but practically, they had 0 bandages and needed to order more to cover the deficit.

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages ordered: 2 bulk packs = \(2 \times 50 = 100\)
   - Bandages used: Half a pack = \(50 / 2 = 25\)
   - Bandages at the end of the third day: \(100 - 25 = 75\)
   - According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means they must have had 3 more bandages before using 25 on the third day. Therefore, before using 25 bandages, they had \(78 + 25 = 103\) bandages.

4. **Calculating the Initial Bandages:**
   - At the end of the second day, they had 0 bandages.
   - Before the third day, they had 103 bandages.
   - Therefore, the bandages they started with on the first day plus the 50 bandages ordered on the first day and the 12 bandages left at the end of the first day should equal 103.
   - Let \(x\) be the number of bandages they started with on the first day. Then, \(x + 50 + 12 = 103\).
   - Solving for \(x\), we get \(x + 62 = 103\), so \(x = 103 - 62 = 41\).

The number of bandages they started with on the first day is \(\boxed{41}\)."
"First, calculate the cost of the haircut. The difference in hair length is \(10 - 8 = 2\) inches. The cost per inch of the haircut is $30, so the cost of the haircut is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) dollars.

The total cost is \(60 + 40 = 100\) dollars.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
100"
"First, let's calculate Jen's weekly earnings from her hourly rate:

- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her weekly earnings from her hourly rate are:
\[ 7.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 6 \, \text{days/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = 45 \, \text{hours/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$67.5 \, \text{per week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total earnings from her hourly rate for April are:
\[ \$67.5 \, \text{per week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = \$270 \]

Since Jen did not incur any absences in April, she will also receive the additional $10 for complete attendance. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:
\[ \$270 + \$10 = \$280 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"To determine how much money Jason earned, we need to calculate the earnings from each task and then sum them up.

1. **Laundry**: Jason did his laundry once, earning $3.00.
2. **Cleaning his room**: Jason cleaned his room once, earning $1.50.
3. **Taking the trash to the curb**: Jason took the trash out twice, earning $0.75 each time. So, for two times, he earned \(2 \times 0.75 = 1.50\) dollars.
4. **Emptying the dishwasher**: Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times, earning $0.50 each time. So, for six times, he earned \(6 \times 0.50 = 3.00\) dollars.

Now, we sum up all the earnings:
\[
3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 + 3.00 = 9.00
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Jason earned is \(\boxed{9.00}\)."
"Each whale has 40 gallons of blood. Therefore, a shark, which has three times as much blood as a whale, has:

\[ 40 \text{ gallons} \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

If we have ten sharks, the total amount of blood in these ten sharks is:

\[ 120 \text{ gallons/shark} \times 10 \text{ sharks} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

\[ 1200 \text{ gallons} \]"
"To find the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up the number of people who entered at different times.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first (50 people) had entered. So, \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people entered by evening.

Now, we sum these numbers:
\[50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320\]

The total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is \(\boxed{320}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of red pens Alain's mom bought. She bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack contains 5 pens. Therefore, the total number of red pens is:

\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens per pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

Next, we need to find out how many black pens were bought. According to the problem, the number of black pens is twice the number of red pens. Since there are 25 red pens, the number of black pens is:

\[ 2 \times 25 \text{ red pens} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

Now, we add the number of red pens and black pens to find the total number of pens:

\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so:

\[ \text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the cognac:

\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac to find the total amount John spends:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2400} \]"
"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted:
- 20 White Oak trees.
- Twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted:
- 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which is \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day, which is \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days:
- Total White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\).
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: \(40 + 50 = 90\).

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:
\[50 + 90 = 140\]

Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is \(\boxed{140}\)."
"Let's calculate the amount of root beer step by step:

1. **Initial amount**: Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.
2. **After the children drank**: They drank 4 gallons, so the remaining amount is:

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \( \boxed{8} \)."
"First, let's determine how many fish have red stripes. One-third of the 66 fish have red stripes:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

So, 22 fish have red stripes. Now, we need to find out how many fish are left after removing the fish with red stripes:

\[
66 - 22 = 44
\]

Next, we calculate how many of the remaining 44 fish have blue stripes. According to the problem, 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes:

\[
\frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

So, 20 fish have blue stripes. To find the total number of fish that have either red stripes or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[
22 + 20 = 42
\]

Therefore, the total number of fish that have red stripes and blue stripes is:

\[
\boxed{42}

"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy originally had:

- Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
- She also had three makeup sets with six colors each: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.
- Therefore, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy originally had is \(8 + 18 = 26\) colors.

Next, let's account for the colors stolen and used:

- Her sister steals one of the palettes, which had 4 colors: \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors left.
- Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which originally had 6 colors: \(\frac{6}{2} = 3\) colors used.
- Therefore, the number of colors from that makeup set left is \(6 - 3 = 3\) colors.

Now, let's calculate the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left:

- The remaining eyeshadow colors from the two palettes: \(4 + 14 = 18\) colors.
- The remaining eyeshadow colors from the two makeup sets: \(3 + 12 = 15\) colors.
- Therefore, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is \(18 + 15 = 33\) colors.

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's determine the height of Mattison's two-story house. Since his house is 7 times as high as he is, and Mattison is 60 inches tall, the height of the house is:

\[ 60 \text{ inches} \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find the height of the first floor to the ceiling. This height is thrice as high as Mattison is, so:

\[ 60 \text{ inches} \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

The height of the house is the sum of the height of the first floor to the ceiling and the height of the second floor. Therefore, the height of the second floor is:

\[ 420 \text{ inches} - 180 \text{ inches} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Thus, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:

\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"First, let's determine how many shells team Alphas found. Since they found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

This means team Alphas found 280 shells. Now, we need to find out how many shells were left for the other two teams after team Alphas found their share:

\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Next, we calculate how many shells team The finders found. They found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

So, team The finders found 252 shells. To find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the number of shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells after team Alphas found their share:

\[ 420 - 252 = 168 \]

Therefore, team Gogetters found:

\[ \boxed{168} \]"
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

First, let's calculate the total miles walked by all four dogs based on the average:
- The average miles walked per day by the four dogs is 3 miles.
- Therefore, the total miles walked by all four dogs in a day is \(3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles}\).

Next, we know the miles walked by the first three dogs:
- The first dog walks 1 mile.
- The second dog walks 4 miles.
- The third dog walks 3 miles.

Adding these up gives:
\[1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}\]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs:
\[12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles}\]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk \(\boxed{4}\) miles."
"First, we calculate the amount of the loan John gets. The loan is 40% of the value of his house, which is worth $250,000.

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000 \]

Next, we determine how much of this loan amount John uses to pay off his debts. He uses 60% of the loan amount.

\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000 \]

Finally, we find out how much money John has leftover after paying his debts.

\[ \text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

Therefore, the amount of money John had leftover after paying his debt is:

- First tuna: 56 kilograms
- Second tuna: 46 kilograms
- Last tuna: 26 kilograms

Adding these weights together:
\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings from selling 128 kilograms of tuna at a rate of $0.50 per kilogram.

\[ 128 \text{ kg} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/kg} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Deandre will earn \(\boxed{64}\) dollars after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To determine Trinity's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the selling price of the magazines.
2. Subtract the buying price from the selling price to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the selling price. Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought them for $72.

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times 1.375 \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 99 \]

Next, we subtract the buying price from the selling price to find the profit.

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"First, let's calculate the amount of water removed by the dehumidifier on each setting:

1. **Low setting**: Removes 1 liter of water per day.
2. **Medium setting**: Removes twice as much as the low setting, which is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) liters of water per day.
3. **High setting**: Removes twice as much as the medium setting, which is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) liters of water per day.

Next, we calculate the total amount of water removed for each period:

- **Low setting for 3 days**: \(1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters}\)
- **Medium setting for 3 days**: \(2 \text{ liters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ liters}\)
- **High setting for 5 days**: \(4 \text{ liters/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ liters}\)

So, they threw:

\[ 288 \text{ balloons} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of the second medicine Saanvi needs for one dose. Since the second medicine is 3 times the amount of the first medicine, and the first medicine is 14 mL, the second medicine would be:

\[ 3 \times 14 \, \text{mL} = 42 \, \text{mL} \]

Next, we add the amounts of both medicines to find the total amount of medicine for one dose:

\[ 14 \, \text{mL} + 42 \, \text{mL} = 56 \, \text{mL} \]

Now, to find the total amount of medicine for 8 doses, we multiply the amount for one dose by 8:

\[ 56 \, \text{mL} \times 8 = 448 \, \text{mL} \]

Therefore, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is:

\[ 448 \, \text{mL} \]"
"First, we determine the capacity of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has \(\frac{1}{8}\) the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, we calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[
\text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students}
\]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:

\[
\text{Total capacity of John's school} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students}
\]

The capacity of Ali's class is 120 students. Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is:

\[
\text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students}
\]

Thus, the combined capacity of both schools is \(\boxed{150}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen needs to return, including the 2% interest on the $300 he borrowed.

The interest is calculated as:
\[ 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen needs to return is:
\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 each month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in these 11 months is:
\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he has already paid from the total amount he needs to return:
\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of diaper changes needed per day for both children. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day and there are 2 children:

\[ 5 \text{ changes/child/day} \times 2 \text{ children} = 10 \text{ changes/day} \]

Jordan's wife changes half of these diaper changes. Therefore, she changes:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes} \]

Since Jordan changes the other half, the number of diaper changes Jordan does per day is also:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes} \]

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

"First, let's calculate the volume of the jar. The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall. The volume \( V \) of the jar is given by:

\[ V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans, considering the packing efficiency. The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume \( V_{\text{eff}} \) is:

\[ V_{\text{eff}} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches. Therefore, the maximum number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is:

\[ \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \]

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the estimated number of red jelly beans is:

\[ \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between the true number and the estimated number is:

\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

So, Tim's guess was off by:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"

2. **People entering at the first stop**: 40 people.
   - Total number of people on the bus after the first stop: \(20 + 40 = 60\) people.
3. **People entering at the second stop**: \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who entered at the first stop.
   - Number of people entering at the second stop: \(\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30\) people.
   - Total number of people on the bus after the second stop: \(60 + 30 = 90\) people.
4. **People entering at the third stop**: The number of passengers on the bus doubled.
   - Number of people entering at the third stop: \(2 \times 90 = 180\) people.
   - Total number of people on the bus after the third stop: \(90 + 180 = 270\) people.

Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, it is already over capacity with 270 people on board. Therefore, the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 0, as the bus is already at full capacity and over.

**Final numerical answer:**

"First, let's calculate the total number of visits Pauline made to the museum over the 8 years.

Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year. Over 5 years, she made:
\[ 3 \text{ visits/year} \times 5 \text{ years} = 15 \text{ visits} \]

For the next 3 years, she continued to visit 3 times a year:
\[ 3 \text{ visits/year} \times 3 \text{ years} = 9 \text{ visits} \]

So, the total number of visits over 8 years is:
\[ 15 \text{ visits} + 9 \text{ visits} = 24 \text{ visits} \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of one visit after the increase. The initial cost of one visit is $2. After a 150% increase, the new cost is:
\[ 2 \text{ dollars} + (150\% \times 2 \text{ dollars}) = 2 \text{ dollars} + 3 \text{ dollars} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount spent on all 24 visits at the new cost:
\[ 24 \text{ visits} \times 5 \text{ dollars/visit} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of students who can try the escape room. There are 10 students in each of the 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th) who qualify, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time.

The total number of students is:
\[ 10 \text{ students/grade} \times 4 \text{ grades} = 40 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many groups of 8 students can be formed from these 40 students:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students/group}} = 5 \text{ groups} \]

Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room. Since all groups use their full 45 minutes and there are 5 groups, the total time required for all students to try the escape room is:
\[ 5 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 225 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take \(\boxed{225}\) minutes for everyone to try the escape room."
"John manufactured 4 wooden tables for $20 each and 2 roof frames for $10 each. 

The cost for the wooden tables is:
\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

The cost for the roof frames is:

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost:
\[ 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Therefore, Ali has to pay John:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece, which is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, is:
\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is \(\boxed{32}\) feet."
"First, we need to determine how many pounds of ground beef Aiden will need to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef, we can calculate the required pounds of ground beef as follows:

\[
\text{Pounds of ground beef} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much of his secret steakhouse seasoning he will need. Since he adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef, for 5 pounds of ground beef, he will need:

\[
\text{Seasoning needed} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons}
\]

Therefore, Aiden will need \boxed{10} tablespoons of his secret seasoning."
"First, calculate the total width of the windows:

\[ \text{Total width} = 5 \times 35 \text{ inches} = 175 \text{ inches} \]

Next, since Luke needs fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows:

\[ \text{Fabric needed} = 2 \times 175 \text{ inches} = 350 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two segments: the first 16 minutes and the remaining minutes.

1. **Cost for the first 16 minutes:**
   - Each minute costs $0.25.
   - Total cost for 16 minutes = \( 16 \times 0.25 = 4 \) dollars.

2. **Cost for the remaining minutes:**
   - The call duration is 36 minutes, so the remaining minutes after the first 16 minutes = \( 36 - 16 = 20 \) minutes.
   - Each of these minutes costs $0.20.
   - Total cost for 20 minutes = \( 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost for the 36-minute call:**
   - Total cost = Cost for the first 16 minutes + Cost for the remaining 20 minutes.
   - Total cost = \( 4 + 4 = 8 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
8 dollars."
"On Monday, it rained 2 inches. 

On Tuesday, it is expected to rain 1 more inch than twice Monday's total. 

Twice Monday's total is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) inches.

Therefore, the expected rainfall on Tuesday is 5 inches.

5 inches"
"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly makes as \( c \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. So, the number of brownies \( b \) can be expressed as:
\[ b = 3c - 2 \]

Each of the 5 people in the class gets 2 treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ c + b = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( b \) into the equation:
\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]

Add 2 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 4c = 12 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ c = 3 \]

So, Carly made \(\boxed{3}\) cupcakes."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the basic manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount.

The cost of a basic manicure is $35, and the cost of a basic pedicure is $40. The total cost before the discount is:
\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

With a 20% discount, the amount of the discount is:
\[ 75 \times 0.20 = 15 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Next, we need to add the cost of the nail art. Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers in total (5 on each hand). The cost of nail art per nail is $3, so the total cost for nail art is:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Adding the cost of the nail art to the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure, the total amount Karen would pay is:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Susan orders 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year each.
2. She has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year.
3. Her last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine.

Now, let's calculate the total number of issues from each type of magazine:

1. For the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year each:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ issues} \]

2. For the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
\[ 6 \text{ issues} \]

3. For the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ issues} \]

Next, we add up all the issues to find the total number of magazines she gets every year:
\[ 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 \text{ issues} \]

However, the question asks for the total number of magazines, not the total number of issues. We need to count the number of magazines:

- 3 magazines that send 12 issues each
- 1 magazine that sends 6 issues
- 1 magazine that sends 24 issues

So, the total number of magazines is:
\[ 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"Given that Samantha has 27 paintings and she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, we can determine the number of paintings Shelley has by adding 12 to Samantha's number of paintings.

\[ \text{Shelley's paintings} = 27 + 12 = 39 \]

Next, since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, we can find the number of paintings Kim has by subtracting 8 from Shelley's number of paintings.

\[ \text{Kim's paintings} = 39 - 8 = 31 \]

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings."
"In November, the toy was priced at $40.

In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price:
\[ \text{Increase} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]
\[ \text{New price in December} = 40 + 32 = 72 \]

In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the new price:
\[ \text{Decrease} = 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.50 = 36 \]
\[ \text{Price in January} = 72 - 36 = 36 \]

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"First, let's calculate the amount Charlie earns from the 4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour.

\[ 4 \text{ lessons} \times \$80 \text{ per lesson} = \$320 \]

Next, we need to determine the reduced rate for lessons with a veteran. The standard rate is reduced by 25%, so the new rate is:

\[ 100\% - 25\% = 75\% \]
\[ 75\% \text{ of } \$80 = 0.75 \times \$80 = \$60 \]

Now, let's calculate the amount Charlie earns from the 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran at the reduced rate of $60 per hour.

\[ 2 \text{ lessons} \times \$60 \text{ per lesson} = \$120 \]

Finally, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make for the day.

\[ \$320 + \$120 = \$440 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is \(\boxed{440}\) dollars."

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos."
"First, let's calculate how many apples Walter ate. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 apples:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

So, the number of apples remaining after Walter ate some is:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, Walter gave 25% of the remaining apples to his sister. To find out how many apples that is, we calculate 25% of 36:

\[
0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
\]

So, the number of apples remaining after giving some to his sister is:

\[
36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
\]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. The total money he received is:

\[
27 \times 3 = 81
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{81}

"To determine the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days. Michael travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr. Assuming he drives for 24 hours each day (excluding stops), the distance he covers each day is:
\[ 50 \, \text{km/hr} \times 24 \, \text{hr/day} = 1200 \, \text{km/day} \]

Over 3 days, the total distance he covers is:
\[ 1200 \, \text{km/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3600 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we need to find what percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas (6000 km) Michael has covered. The percentage is calculated as follows:
\[ \left( \frac{3600 \, \text{km}}{6000 \, \text{km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered is:
\[ \boxed{60\%} \]"
"First, let's determine how many grapes Madeline's brother used to make the grape juice. Since he used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, and Madeline ate 6 grapes, we calculate:

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many grapes were used to make the pies. Since each pie requires 12 grapes and there are 4 pies, we calculate:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

Now, we add the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and her mother to find the total number of grapes used:

\[ 6 + 30 + 48 = 84 \text{ grapes} \]

Therefore, the total number of grapes at the beginning was:

\[ \boxed{84} \]"

"First, let's break down the costs Bud incurs for making macaroni and cheese each week:

1. **Pasta cost**: $1.00 per box.
2. **Cheddar cheese cost**: $3.00.
3. **Gruyere cheese cost**: Twice the amount spent on cheddar cheese, which is \(2 \times 3 = $6.00\).

Now, let's calculate the total weekly cost:
\[
\text{Total weekly cost} = \text{Pasta cost} + \text{Cheddar cheese cost} + \text{Gruyere cheese cost} = 1 + 3 + 6 = $10.00
\]

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, we need to find out how much he spends in one year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:
\[
\text{Total yearly cost} = \text{Total weekly cost} \times 52 = 10 \times 52 = $520.00
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year is:
\[

"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes to clean one classroom, the total time required is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many minutes the custodian works in a day. Since they work an 8-hour day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total working time in a day is:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to clean all the classrooms. Since the custodian has 5 days to clean the school, we can calculate the total time available over these 5 days:

\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 480 \text{ minutes/day} = 2400 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 1200 minutes are required to clean all the classrooms and the custodian has 2400 minutes available over 5 days, we can see that the custodian has enough time to clean all the classrooms within the given timeframe. Now, we need to find out what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning classrooms. The time spent cleaning per day is the total time required divided by the number of days:

\[ \frac{1200 \text{ minutes}}{5 \text{ days}} = 240 \text{ minutes/day} \]

To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning, we use the formula:

\[ \left( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{480 \text{ minutes}} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage of their day, on average, that is spent cleaning classrooms is:

\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"
"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Next, we calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:

- The middle 2 shelves together can hold \(10 + 10 = 20\) books.
- Adding the bottom and top shelves, the total capacity of one bookcase is \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Now, we need to find out how many bookcases Elly needs to hold 110 books:

- Since one bookcase can hold 55 books, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: \(110 \div 55 = 2\).

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs, and the cost per dozen is $2.40. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \text{ dozens} \times \$2.40 \text{ per dozen} = \$12.00 \]

Next, let's determine the selling price per egg. Rose sells the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs. Therefore, the price per egg is:
\[ \frac{\$1}{3 \text{ eggs}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ dollars per egg} \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the eggs. Rose has 5 dozens of eggs, which is:
\[ 5 \text{ dozens} \times 12 \text{ eggs per dozen} = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

The total revenue from selling 60 eggs at \(\frac{1}{3}\) dollars per egg is:
\[ 60 \text{ eggs} \times \frac{1}{3} \text{ dollars per egg} = \$20.00 \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \$20.00 - \$12.00 = \$8.00 \]

Therefore, Rose's profit is:

"First, let's determine the number of red hats. Since half of the hats are red, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hats are left after removing the red hats:

\[ \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Out of these remaining hats, \( \frac{3}{5} \) are blue. So, the number of blue hats is:

\[ \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

The rest of the hats are white. To find the number of white hats, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats:

\[ \text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of white hats Skyler has is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the beef jerky after the discount. The original price of a bag is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount, so the new price is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each stick of jerky costs. Since there are 30 sticks in a bag and the bag now costs $15.00, the cost per stick is:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.50 to cents:

\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

So, the cost per stick of jerky is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass. She needs to get 70% of the total questions correct. The total number of questions is the sum of the questions from both tests:

\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

To pass, she needs to get 70% of 110 questions correct:

\[ 0.70 \times 110 = 77 \]

So, Audrey needs to get 77 questions correct in total.

Next, we calculate how many questions she got correct on the first test. She got 60% of the 70 questions correct:

\[ 0.60 \times 70 = 42 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more questions she needs to get correct on the second test to reach the total of 77 correct answers. We subtract the number of correct answers from the first test from the total number of correct answers needed:

\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

**Final Answer:**

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes Mary makes as \( S \). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes she makes is \( 5S - 4 \).

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry cubes and the blueberry cubes, which is given as 116. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Next, we solve for \( S \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, add 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Then, divide both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. Now, we need to find the number of blueberry cubes, which is \( 5S - 4 \):
\[ 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \(\boxed{96}\)."

"John takes 5 minutes to get to the first side of the Rubik's cube.

The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ minutes each} \]

The last 2 sides each take half as long as the first side, so:
\[ \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \text{ minutes each} \]

The sixth side takes no additional time since getting the fifth side completes the cube.

Now, we sum up the times:
\[ 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

The total time to solve the Rubik's cube is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} \]"
"Given that there were 20 helmets, we can determine the number of robots and footballs based on the information provided.

"First, let's calculate how many minutes Tim spends at work each day answering phones. Since he spends 6 hours each day at work and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total minutes as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many calls he can handle in one day. Since it takes him 15 minutes to deal with each call, we divide the total minutes he spends at work each day by the time it takes to handle one call:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes/day}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 24 \text{ calls/day} \]

Now, to find out how many calls he deals with during his 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls he handles each day by the number of workdays in a week:

\[ 24 \text{ calls/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 120 \text{ calls/week} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

Now, calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings with the old varnish:
\[ 7 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 42 \text{ minutes} \]

Then, calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings with the new varnish:
\[ 12 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 72 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, find the difference in drying time between the new and old varnish for 6 paintings:
\[ 72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of water needed for each group of plants.

1. For the 4 plants that need half a cup of water each:
\[ 4 \text{ plants} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ cup/plant} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

2. For the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water each:
\[ 8 \text{ plants} \times 1 \text{ cup/plant} = 8 \text{ cups} \]

3. The rest of the plants need a quarter of a cup of water each. Since Crista has 20 plants in total and 4 + 8 = 12 plants have been accounted for, the remaining number of plants is:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ plants} \]
\[ 8 \text{ plants} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ cup/plant} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we add up the total amount of water needed for all the plants:
\[ 2 \text{ cups} + 8 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 12 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"First, we need to determine the total distance Phineas needs to travel to get back home. Since the rainstorm washed him 200 yards away, the distance back home is also 200 yards.

Next, we know that half of this distance is on land and the other half is in water. Therefore, the distance on land is:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ yards}}{2} = 100 \text{ yards} \]
And the distance in water is also:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ yards}}{2} = 100 \text{ yards} \]

Phineas hops on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute. The time it takes to hop 100 yards on land is:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Phineas swims in water at a speed of 10 yards per minute. The time it takes to swim 100 yards in water is:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the time spent hopping and swimming gives the total time to return home:

"First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed after training. His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster:

\[ 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of words John needs to speak. Each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages:

\[ 450 \, \text{words/page} \times 10 \, \text{pages} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we calculate the time it takes for John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. The time \( t \) in minutes can be calculated using the formula:

\[ t = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{WPM}} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} \]

\[ t = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages."
"On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day, so:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \text{ people} \]

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so:
\[ 2 \times 70 = 140 \text{ people} \]

For the rest of the week (days 4, 5, 6, and 7), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Therefore, the total number of people he saw from day 4 to day 7 is:
\[ 60 \times 4 = 240 \text{ people} \]

Now, we sum up the number of people Conor saw each day to get the total for the week:
\[ 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 480 \]

Thus, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:

"Let's break down the popping rates and calculate the total number of popped kernels step by step.

1. **First 30 seconds:**
   - Kernels popped: 20

2. **Next 30 seconds:**
   - Popping rate is three times the initial rate.
   - Kernels popped: \(3 \times 20 = 60\)

3. **Following 30 seconds:**
   - Popping rate is four times the initial rate.
   - Kernels popped: \(4 \times 20 = 80\)

4. **Final 30 seconds:**
   - Popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds.
   - Kernels popped: \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\)

5. **Residual heat:**
   - A quarter of the kernels popped in the final 30 seconds also pop.
   - Kernels popped from residual heat: \(\frac{40}{4} = 10\)

"To determine how many lemons Tim will need, we first calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for the lemonade.

1. **Calculate the lemon juice needed for the main 4 gallons:**
   - Each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice.
   - For 4 gallons, the total lemon juice needed is \(4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups}\).

2. **Calculate the lemon juice needed for the extra gallon:**
   - The extra gallon is twice as tart, so it requires twice the amount of lemon juice.
   - Therefore, the extra gallon needs \(2 \text{ cups}\).

3. **Calculate the total lemon juice needed:**
   - Total lemon juice = lemon juice for 4 gallons + lemon juice for the extra gallon
   - Total lemon juice = \(4 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 6 \text{ cups}\).

4. **Convert the total lemon juice needed into lemons:**
   - 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
   - Therefore, for 6 cups of juice, the number of lemons needed is \(6 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 36 \text{ lemons}\).

Thus, Tim will need \(\boxed{36}\) lemons."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know the tower is made up of 4 blue blocks.
2. The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks, so there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) yellow blocks.
3. Let the number of red blocks be \(R\).

The total number of blocks in the tower is the sum of the blue, yellow, and red blocks, which is given as 32. So, we can write the equation:

\[4 \text{ (blue blocks)} + 8 \text{ (yellow blocks)} + R \text{ (red blocks)} = 32\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[12 + R = 32\]

\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \]

The total age of the siblings is the sum of the ages of the three sisters and the two brothers:
\[ 48 + 12 + 24 = 84 \]

Therefore, the total age of all these siblings is:
\[ 84 \]"
"Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes before bed, which totals 30 minutes of meditation per day. Over 4 weeks, assuming she practices every day, she spends:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 840 \text{ minutes} \]

Additionally, she practices 1 hour of yoga, 5 days a week. Over 4 weeks, this amounts to:

\[ 1 \text{ hour/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Converting the yoga practice time into minutes (since 1 hour = 60 minutes):

\[ 20 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the time spent on meditation and yoga:

\[ 840 \text{ minutes} + 1200 \text{ minutes} = 2040 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, in 4 weeks, Charisma has spent 2040 minutes on meditation and yoga practice."

"First, let's determine the distance Aaron ran. According to the problem, Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron. Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, Aaron ran half of that distance:

\[ \text{Distance Aaron ran} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know that Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. If Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes, we can find the time it took him to run one mile:

\[ \text{Time per mile for Aaron} = \frac{16 \text{ minutes}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 8 \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's time per mile is twice that of Aaron's:

\[ \text{Time per mile for Vanessa} = 8 \text{ minutes per mile} \times 2 = 16 \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Vanessa ran 4 miles, so the total time she took to complete her part of the race is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and he gets it at 80% off.

\[ \text{Discounted price of the radiator} = 400 \times (1 - 0.80) = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

So, the radiator costs $80 after the discount.

Next, we calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

\[ \text{Cost of labor} = 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the labor to find the total amount Mark paid.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is \(\boxed{230}\)."
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( C \) be the number of chickens.
- Let \( K \) be the number of cows.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( 2C + 4K = 70 \) (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To eliminate \( C \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \)."
