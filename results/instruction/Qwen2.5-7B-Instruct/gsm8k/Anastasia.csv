"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and uses 4 for baking muffins for her friends. So, the total number of eggs used by Janet is:

3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for baking) = 7 eggs

The remainder of the eggs that she sells at the farmers' market is:

16 (total eggs) - 7 (used eggs) = 9 eggs

She sells each egg for $2. Therefore, the amount she makes from selling the eggs at the farmers' market every day is:

9 (eggs) * $2 (per egg) = $18

So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber, which means it takes 1 bolt of white fiber (since half of 2 is 1).

"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The value increased by 150%, so we need to find 150% of the original purchase price and add it to the original purchase price.

The original purchase price is $80,000. 150% of $80,000 is calculated as follows:
\[ 150\% \times 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

Adding this to the original purchase price gives us the new value of the house:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost, which includes the purchase price and the repair cost:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000."
"James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. He does this 3 times a week. 

So, the total distance he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total distance he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters

Therefore, the total meters James runs a week is 540 meters."
"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken consumes in a day.
2. Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon.
3. Subtract the total morning and afternoon feed from the daily feed requirement to find the amount needed for the final meal.

First, we know that each chicken consumes 3 cups of feed per day. With 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we know that in the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed, and in the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed. So, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the morning and afternoon feed from the total daily feed requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens \(\boxed{20}\) cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of 16 glasses, considering that every second glass is 60% of the regular price.

1. The cost of the first glass is $5.
2. The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = $3\).

This pattern continues, so for every pair of glasses, the cost is $5 (first glass) + $3 (second glass) = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide 16 by 2 to find out how many pairs of glasses he is buying: \(16 \div 2 = 8\) pairs.

Now, we multiply the cost of one pair by the number of pairs: \(8 \times 8 = $64\).

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

64"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sheep each city has based on the given relationships and then sum them up.

1. Let's start with the number of sheep in Seattle. According to the problem, Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So, the number of sheep in Charleston is \(4 \times 20 = 80\).
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, the number of sheep in Toulouse is \(2 \times 80 = 160\).

Now, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together:
\[ 160 + 80 + 20 = 260 \]

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 260."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. Calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the file.
2. Add the time taken for the Windows update restart.
3. Calculate the time to download the remaining 60% of the file.
4. Sum up all the times to get the total download time.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Time to download 40% of the file:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Time for the Windows update restart:**
   - This is given as 20 minutes.

3. **Time to download the remaining 60% of the file:**
   - 60% of 200 GB is \( 0.60 \times 200 = 120 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \( \frac{120}{2} = 60 \) minutes.

4. **Total time:**
   - Sum of the times from each step: \( 40 \) minutes (first 40%) + \( 20 \) minutes (Windows update) + \( 60 \) minutes (remaining 60%) = \( 120 \) minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is 120 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance John has traveled and then determine how far he is from home at the end of the 4 hours.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Journey:**
   - John drives for 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered during this time.
   - He then drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - He then drives for the remaining 1.5 hours (4 hours total - 2 hours in standstill - 0.5 hours at 30 mph) at 80 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Traveled:**
   - Total distance = Distance from first leg + Distance from return journey = 180 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - Since John is driving back home, the total distance he has traveled (315 miles) is the distance from his current position to home.

Therefore, at the end of those 4 hours, John is 315 miles from home."

Eliza's earnings for this week are $460."
"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ downloads} \]

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, so the program had 70% of the second month's downloads:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \text{ downloads} \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

The program had a total of 366 downloads over the three months."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit becomes positive.

First, let's break down the costs and revenues:

1. **Initial Cost**: $90 (cost to plant the tree)
2. **Annual Costs**: $3 (water and feed the tree)
3. **Annual Revenue**: 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5

Now, let's calculate the net profit for each year after the initial year:

- **Net Profit per Year**: $10.5 (revenue) - $3 (cost) = $7.5

To find out how many years it will take to cover the initial cost, we divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:

- **Years to Cover Initial Cost**: $90 / $7.5 = 12 years

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

**Final Answer: 12 years**"
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there. This leaves her with \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners.

4. According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left after these sales. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

5. To solve for \( x \), first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]

6. Add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]

7. Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 2x = 36 \]

8. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

18"
"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we have:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after the contemporary dance enrollment:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Now, 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

So, the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is the remaining students after contemporary and jazz dance enrollments:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the following calculation:

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100\% = 0.60 \times 100\% = 60\% \]

Therefore, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the expected value of the profit from each purchase after the speculated market increase.

1. **Jewelry Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value after increase: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125
   - Profit: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

2. **Electronic Gadgets Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value after increase: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096
   - Profit: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits:
- Jewelry profit: $125
- Electronic gadgets profit: $96

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing the jewelry, which would yield a profit of $125.

**Final numerical answer:**

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her earnings from both her teaching and coaching jobs and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour for teaching.
- Therefore, her weekly earnings from teaching are \(35 \text{ hours/week} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$700/\text{week}\).

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
- She works 50 weeks a year.
- Therefore, her annual earnings from teaching are \(50 \text{ weeks/year} \times \$700/\text{week} = \$35,000/\text{year}\).

Now, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour for coaching.
- Therefore, her weekly earnings from coaching are \(15 \text{ hours/week} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$450/\text{week}\).

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from coaching:
- She works 50 weeks a year.
- Therefore, her annual earnings from coaching are \(50 \text{ weeks/year} \times \$450/\text{week} = \$22,500/\text{year}\).

Finally, let's sum up her annual earnings from both jobs to get her total annual salary:
- Her total annual salary is \(\$35,000 + \$22,500 = \$57,500\).

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is $57,500."
"Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning. There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 * 7 = 28 days.

If she makes 3 egg omelets every day, then in 28 days, she will have made 3 * 28 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the number of dozens of eggs she will eat in 4 weeks is 84 / 12 = 7 dozens.

7 dozens"
"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time required to cover 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time already spent:**
   \[
   \text{Time spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Determine the remaining time to cover the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining time} = \text{Total time} - \text{Time spent} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Required speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Remaining time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks separately, then account for the spill, and finally sum the remaining water.

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink:**
   - The orange drink is two-thirds water.
   - Amount of water in the orange drink = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 \) liters = \( \frac{20}{3} \) liters ≈ 6.67 liters.

2. **Calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:**
   - The pineapple drink is three-fifths water.
   - Amount of water in the pineapple drink = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 \) liters = 9 liters.

3. **Account for the spill:**
   - We spill 1 liter of the orange drink.
   - Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the spilled liter contains \( \frac{2}{3} \) liter of water.
   - Water spilled = \( \frac{2}{3} \) liter.

4. **Calculate the remaining water in the orange drink:**
   - Remaining water in the orange drink = \( \frac{20}{3} \) liters - \( \frac{2}{3} \) liter = \( \frac{18}{3} \) liters = 6 liters.

5. **Calculate the total amount of water in the 24 liters:**
   - Total water = Water from the remaining orange drink + Water from the pineapple drink
   - Total water = 6 liters + 9 liters = 15 liters.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Raymond's current age.
2. Determine the age of Raymond's son when he was born.
3. Calculate the difference between Samantha's current age and the age of Raymond's son when he was born.

First, we know that Samantha is currently 31 years old. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond is currently 31 - 6 = 25 years old.

Next, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. Therefore, Raymond's son is currently 25 - 23 = 2 years old.

To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to subtract the current age of Raymond's son from Samantha's current age. Since Samantha is 31 and Raymond's son is 2, the son was born 31 - 2 = 29 years ago.

"To find the original price of the book, we can use the relationship between the original price, the discount, and the final price. Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

Given that Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after a 25% discount, this means he paid 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

So, we can write the equation as:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's calculate the value:
\[ P = 26.00 \]

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.00."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we first need to calculate the total cost of the other items she bought.

1. The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
2. The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
3. The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. So, the amount spent on pizza is:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can find the number of boxes by dividing the total amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\] boxes.

Therefore, Marie ordered \(\boxed{2}\) boxes of pizza."

"Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. Over 60 days, she will consume 60 servings of ice cream.

Each carton contains 15 servings and costs $4.00. To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Since each carton costs $4.00, the total cost for 4 cartons is:

\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00/\text{carton} = \$16.00 \]

After 60 days, Cynthia will spend \(\boxed{16.00}\) on ice cream."
"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between these two points on his trip.

1. Henry's first stop was after 20 miles.
2. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip. This means he stopped at the 45th mile (60 - 15 = 45).

Now, to find the distance between the 20th mile and the 45th mile, we subtract the mile marker of the first stop from the mile marker of the second stop:

45 miles - 20 miles = 25 miles

Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

25 miles"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. So, we can write the equation for the total cost of the two pairs of high heels as:
\[ 33 + 2 \times 33 = B - 5 \]

First, calculate the cost of the two pairs of high heels:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Therefore, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up the relationship between Darrell's and Allen's ages based on the given ratio and total age.

Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total age of Darrell and Allen is given as 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can find Allen's current age:

\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

Allen's age 10 years from now will be:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine the guesses of each friend.

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we add these guesses together and divide by the number of guesses (which is 3) to find the average.

\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]

\[ \text{Average guess} = \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

The average guess is 80."
"To find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily hours spent on each dog.
2. Multiply the daily hours by the number of dogs.
3. Multiply the result by the number of days in a week.

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day. John has 10 dogs. So, the daily hours spent on all dogs is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly hours spent are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations based on the information given:
\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

70"
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Raymond has 40 jewels, and Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Then, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[ 25 - 2 = 23 \]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points that is, we calculate 25% of 4 points:

25% of 4 points = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 points + 1 point = 5 points.

To find the total points scored, we add the points from both halves of the game:

Total points = 4 points (first 20 minutes) + 5 points (second 20 minutes) = 9 points

Therefore, Mike scored a total of 9 points."
"Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Over 30 days, he will consume:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

The yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00. To find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"John sells 13 lego sets at $15 each, so the total amount of money he gets from selling the lego sets is:

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

He then buys 8 video games at $20 each, so the total cost for the video games is:

\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, he has $5 left. This means the money he spent on the video games plus the money he has left equals the money he got from selling the lego sets:

\[ 160 + 5 = 165 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he initially had $195 from selling the lego sets, and he spent $165 on video games and has $5 left, it means he has no lego sets left because he used all the money from selling the lego sets to buy the video games and still had some money left.

Therefore, the number of lego sets he still has is:

\[ 0 \]"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day. Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day. So, the distance he runs each of these days is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = \frac{3v}{2} \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   The total distance he runs in a week is the sum of the distances run on each of the three days:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2} = 3v + 3v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Given total distance:**
   We know that the total distance he runs in a week is 60 miles. Therefore:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]

5. **Solving for \( v \):**
   \[
   v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

**Final numerical answer:**
10 miles per hour"
"First, let's determine Dana's running and walking speeds based on her skipping speed.

Given:
- Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
- Her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed.

So, her running speed is:
\[ 3 \text{ mph} \times 2 = 6 \text{ mph} \]

Next, we know her running speed is four times her walking speed. Therefore, her walking speed is:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ mph}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \]

Now, let's calculate the time she spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the 6 hours running and two-thirds of the 6 hours walking.

Time spent running:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Time spent walking:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the distance she covers while running and walking.

Distance covered while running:
\[ 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Distance covered while walking:
\[ 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances to find the total distance she can travel in six hours:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"If Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, then Ben's iPhone is 2 years old.

Since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, and Ben's iPhone is 2 years old, Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

Therefore, Brandon’s iPhone is 8 years old."
"When Polly is holding the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the gold javelin three times farther than her normal throwing distance. Her normal throwing distance is 400 feet. Therefore, when holding the gemstone, she can throw the javelin:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. Therefore, Polly can stand 1200 feet away from the dragon and still hit it with the gold javelin. Since 1200 feet is outside the dragon's reach, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} \]"
"Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pie pieces available initially is:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the initial number of pieces:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

26"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the calorie content of the entire bag of chips:**
   - A serving has 250 calories.
   - There are 5 servings in a 300g bag.
   - Therefore, the total calories in the bag are \( 250 \times 5 = 1250 \) calories.

2. **Calculate the remaining calories you can consume:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume are \( 2000 - 1800 = 200 \) calories.

3. **Determine how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining calories:**
   - Since the entire 300g bag has 1250 calories, we need to find out how many grams correspond to 200 calories.
   - The ratio of calories to grams in the bag is \( \frac{1250 \text{ calories}}{300 \text{ grams}} \).
   - To find out how many grams correspond to 200 calories, we set up the proportion:
     \[
     \frac{1250 \text{ calories}}{300 \text{ grams}} = \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{x \text{ grams}}
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{200 \times 300}{1250} = \frac{60000}{1250} = 48 \text{ grams}
     \]

Therefore, you can eat 48 grams of chips."
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed to make 20 candles.
2. Determine the total cost of the supplies.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed.
Since Charlie can make 10 candles per pound of beeswax, for 20 candles, he needs:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax} \]

Step 2: Determine the total cost of the supplies.
The cost for one pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00. Therefore, for 2 pounds, the cost is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
If each candle is sold for $2.00, then the total revenue from selling 20 candles is:
\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00 \]

Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.
\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:
\[ \$20.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

- On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
- On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[ 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \]

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is:
\[ 26 \times 4 = 104 \]

Total number of hours spent writing articles in the three days: 104."
"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of Post-it notes Candice had: 80.
2. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she used at work: 220.
3. Add the remaining Post-it notes to find out how many were in the package she purchased.

Let's do the math:

Initial Post-it notes: 80
Post-it notes used at work: 220
Remaining Post-it notes: 23

So, the equation to find the number of Post-it notes in the package is:

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = (80 + 23) - 220 \]

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = 103 - 220 \]

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = -117 \]

It seems there's a mistake in the calculation because the number of Post-it notes can't be negative. Let's correct the equation:

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = (80 + \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package}) - 220 \]

Given that she had 23 remaining:

\[ 80 + \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} - 220 = 23 \]

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = 23 + 220 - 80 \]

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package that she purchased is 163."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost per red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, we add the amount spent on blue ties and red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total spent on red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{800} \]"
"To determine how many 6-inch pieces Tracy can obtain from a 4-foot piece of wire, we first need to convert the length of the wire into inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, a 4-foot piece of wire is:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we divide the total length of the wire in inches by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces Tracy can obtain:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ inches}}{6 \text{ inches/piece}} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.
- The building has 15 floors.
- Each floor contains 8 units.
- Therefore, the total number of units is \(15 \times 8 = 120\).

Step 2: Determine the number of occupied units.
- 3/4 of the building is occupied.
- Therefore, the number of occupied units is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90\).

Step 3: Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.
- The number of unoccupied units is \(120 - 90 = 30\).

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To calculate how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many dozens of eggs are produced per day.
2. Calculate the daily earnings from selling the eggs.
3. Multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week to get the weekly earnings.

Step 1: Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.
Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Step 2: Calculate the daily earnings.
Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, so:
\[ 21 \text{ dozen} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$42 \text{ per day} \]

Step 3: Calculate the weekly earnings.
There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ \$42 \text{ per day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = \$294 \text{ per week} \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\$294\) on eggs per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to know the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. However, the distance is not provided in the question. Let's assume the distance from the starting point to the destination is \(D\) miles.

1. **Outbound Trip:**
   - Speed: 10 miles per hour
   - Time: 3 hours (from 1 PM to 4 PM)
   - Distance: \(D = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}\)

2. **Return Trip:**
   - Speed: 6 miles per hour
   - Distance: 30 miles (same as the outbound trip)
   - Time: \(\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{mph}} = 5 \, \text{hours}\)

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, the remaining weight he needs to remove is:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

Final numerical answer:
15"
"To determine how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day and then find the difference.

**Thursday:**
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires at $60 each.
- The mechanic repairs 4 car tires at $40 each.

Revenue from truck tires on Thursday:
\[ 6 \times 60 = 360 \]

Revenue from car tires on Thursday:
\[ 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Total revenue on Thursday:
\[ 360 + 160 = 520 \]

**Friday:**
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 each.
- The mechanic doesn't repair any truck tires.

Revenue from car tires on Friday:
\[ 12 \times 40 = 480 \]

Total revenue on Friday:
\[ 480 \]

**Difference in Revenue:**
To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the lower revenue from the higher revenue.

Since Thursday's revenue is higher than Friday's:
\[ 520 - 480 = 40 \]

The mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday.

**Final Answer:**

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payments into two halves of the year and then sum them up.

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - The monthly charge is $140.
   - Total for the first half: \( 6 \times 140 = 840 \) dollars.

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - There are 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - The monthly charge is 10% less than the initial amount.
   - 10% of $140 is \( 0.10 \times 140 = 14 \) dollars.
   - The reduced monthly charge is \( 140 - 14 = 126 \) dollars.
   - Total for the second half: \( 6 \times 126 = 756 \) dollars.

3. **Total Amount Paid by the End of the Year:**

The total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is **1596** dollars."
"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg). We know that Sophia has driven 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. Therefore, her car's fuel efficiency is:

\[ \text{Fuel Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Distance Driven}}{\text{Gallons of Gas Used}} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Now, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank of 12 gallons. Using the fuel efficiency we calculated:

\[ \text{Miles on a Full Tank} = \text{Fuel Efficiency} \times \text{Tank Capacity} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each time and reads for half as long, which is 1 hour. So, each session, he spends a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours on TV and reading.

He does this 3 times a week, so in one week, he spends 3 hours/session * 3 sessions/week = 9 hours.

Over 4 weeks, he would spend 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours.

Therefore, Jim spends 36 hours on TV and reading in 4 weeks."
"To find the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to consider the number of players and coaches for both the girls' and boys' teams from each school.

1. Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players.
2. Each school also has 2 coaches (one for each team).

So, for each school:
- Number of players = 2 teams * 5 players/team = 10 players
- Number of coaches = 2 coaches

Therefore, the total number of people per school = 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people

Since there are 4 schools:
- Total number of people = 4 schools * 12 people/school = 48 people

Final numerical answer:
48"
"To find the total number of gems in the chest, we need to calculate the number of each type of gem and then sum them up.

1. **Diamonds**: There are 175 diamonds.
2. **Rubies**: There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So, the number of rubies is \(175 - 35 = 140\).
3. **Emeralds**: There are twice the number of emeralds than the rubies. So, the number of emeralds is \(2 \times 140 = 280\).

Now, we sum up the number of each type of gem to get the total number of gems in the chest:
\[175 \text{ (diamonds)} + 140 \text{ (rubies)} + 280 \text{ (emeralds)} = 595\]

Therefore, the total number of gems in the chest is 595."
"First, let's determine the number of boys at Dr. Wertz's school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

Number of boys = 2 * Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 * 60
Number of boys = 120

Next, we need to find the total number of students at the school. This is the sum of the number of boys and the number of girls:

Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of students = 120 + 60
Total number of students = 180

Now, we know that there are 5 students for every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher:

Number of teachers = Total number of students / Number of students per teacher
Number of teachers = 180 / 5
Number of teachers = 36

Therefore, there are 36 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school."
"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to subtract the total amount of her allowance from her final total.

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks. So, the total allowance she receives is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. To find out how much money she started with, we subtract the total allowance from her final total:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Therefore, Bailey started with $60."
"To calculate how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week.
2. Determine the total number of students she teaches in a week.
3. Calculate the total amount of money she makes from the students.

First, let's calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week:

- She teaches 5 classes every weekday (Monday to Friday), so that's \(5 \times 5 = 25\) classes.
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.

So, the total number of classes in a week is \(25 + 8 = 33\).

Next, we calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week:

- Each class has 15 students.
- Therefore, the total number of students is \(33 \times 15 = 495\).

Finally, we calculate the total amount of money she makes from the students:

- She charges $15.00 per student.
- Therefore, the total amount of money she makes is \(495 \times 15 = 7425\).

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{7425}

"To calculate the total amount of money Tommy raises, we need to multiply the number of each item sold by its price and then add the totals together.

For brownies:
- Tommy sells 43 brownies at $3 per slice.
- Total from brownies = 43 slices * $3/slice = $129

For cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake at $4 per slice.
- Total from cheesecakes = 23 slices * $4/slice = $92

Now, we add the totals from both items:
- Total money raised = $129 (from brownies) + $92 (from cheesecakes) = $221

Therefore, Tommy raises a total of $221."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones without interest:

\[ 5 \text{ cell phones} \times \$150 \text{ per cell phone} = \$750 \]

Next, we need to calculate the interest for each cell phone. Since a 2% interest is charged for each unit, the interest for one cell phone is:

\[ 2\% \times \$150 = 0.02 \times \$150 = \$3 \]

So, the total interest for all five cell phones is:

\[ 5 \text{ cell phones} \times \$3 \text{ per cell phone} = \$15 \]

Adding the total interest to the original total cost gives us the total amount Shiela will pay:

\[ \$750 + \$15 = \$765 \]

Since Shiela will pay this amount in 3 monthly installments, the monthly payment will be:

\[ \frac{\$765}{3 \text{ months}} = \$255 \]

Therefore, Shiela will pay each month for 3 months:

\[ \$255 \]"
"First, let's round the prices to the nearest dollar:

- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3

- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3 = $36
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2 = $18
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2 = $34

Finally, we add up the totals:

$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

Artie will make $88."
"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given that the top level has a square footage of 16, and each subsequent level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of each level as follows:

1. Top level (Level 1): 16 square feet
2. Level 2: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square feet
3. Level 3: \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square feet
4. Level 4: \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square feet

Now, to find the average square footage of a level, we sum the square footage of all levels and divide by the number of levels:

\[
\text{Average square footage} = \frac{16 + 8 + 4 + 2}{4}
\]

\[
\text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5
\]

The average square footage of a level is 7.5 square feet."
"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then consider that the question asks specifically about the first year. Since a year is typically 365 days, we need to find out how much food is needed for the remaining 185 days after the first 180 days.

1. For the first 180 days, the puppy needs 1 cup of dog food per day:
   \[
   180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. For the remaining 185 days, the puppy needs 2 cups of dog food per day:
   \[
   185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. Adding the amounts from the first 180 days and the remaining 185 days gives the total amount of dog food needed for the first year:
   \[
   180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups}
   \]

4. Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we need to determine how many bags are required for 550 cups:
   \[
   \frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags}
   \]

Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the amount of laundry David does:**
   - Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.
   - Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
   - Therefore, David does \( \frac{400}{4} = 100 \) pounds of laundry.

2. **Determine the amount of laundry Raymond does:**
   - Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.
   - Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
   - Therefore, Raymond does \( \frac{400}{2} = 200 \) pounds of laundry.

3. **Calculate the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David:**
   - Raymond does 200 pounds of laundry.
   - David does 100 pounds of laundry.
   - The difference is \( 200 - 100 = 100 \) pounds.

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds."
"To determine how much money Vincent saves, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in the most economical way versus the less economical way.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:
- Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
- Total cost: \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15.00 \)

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1.00 each:
- Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
- Total cost: \( 9 \times 1.00 = 9.00 \)

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two options:
- Cost difference: \( 15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00 \)

Therefore, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

The final numerical answer is:

Subtract the discount from the original cost:
$100 - $30 = $70

The final cost of the grooming is $70."
"Each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water. So, the amount of water each girl got is:

\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they got together is:

\[ 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

The boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water distributed is:

\[ 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

The initial amount of water was 24 liters. Therefore, the amount of water left is:

\[ 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

10 liters of water were left."

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( W + L = 22 \)
2. \( W = L + 8 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find the number of games they won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of times the alarm rang each time it went off and then sum these values.

1. The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.
2. The second time the alarm went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. Since the first time it rang 4 times, the second time it rang \(4 \times 3 = 12\) times.
3. The third time the alarm went off, it rang for half as long as the second time. Since the second time it rang 12 times, the third time it rang \(12 \div 2 = 6\) times.

Now, we sum the number of times the alarm rang each time:
\[4 + 12 + 6 = 22\]

Therefore, the alarm rang a total of 22 times."
"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the salary increase after 5 years.
2. Calculate the salary increase for the next three years.

**Step 1: Calculate the salary after 5 years.**

Sylvie's initial salary is $600 per month. After 5 years, her salary is increased by 10% of the initial salary.

\[ \text{Salary after 5 years} = 600 + (0.10 \times 600) = 600 + 60 = 660 \text{ per month} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the salary after an additional 3 years.**

The salary increases by 10% each year for those who have stayed for 5 years. So, we need to calculate the salary for each of the next three years.

\[ \text{Salary after 6 years} = 660 + (0.10 \times 660) = 660 + 66 = 726 \text{ per month} \]

\[ \text{Salary after 7 years} = 726 + (0.10 \times 726) = 726 + 72.6 = 798.6 \text{ per month} \]

\[ \text{Salary after 8 years} = 798.6 + (0.10 \times 798.6) = 798.6 + 79.86 = 878.46 \text{ per month} \]

**Final Answer:**

Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is $878.46 per month, which is $10,541.52 per year."
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies."
"Christina invited 16 friends, but since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we need to calculate the number of guests who are expected to attend.

1/4 of 16 friends don't show up, so:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \]

This means 4 friends won't attend. Therefore, the number of friends who will attend is:
\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \]

Christina needs .75 gift bags per invited guest. So, for 12 guests, the number of gift bags needed is:
\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost for 9 gift bags is:

"To determine how much potato salad Ted needs to bring, we first need to calculate the total amount of potato salad that will be consumed by the adults and the children.

1. Calculate the amount of potato salad each child will eat:
   - An adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
   - A child eats half as much as an adult, so a child will eat \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) lbs of potato salad.

2. Calculate the total amount of potato salad for the adults:
   - There are 20 adults, and each will eat 10 lbs.
   - So, the total for adults is \( 20 \times 10 = 200 \) lbs.

3. Calculate the total amount of potato salad for the children:
   - There are 5 children, and each will eat 5 lbs.
   - So, the total for children is \( 5 \times 5 = 25 \) lbs.

4. Add the amounts for adults and children to get the total amount of potato salad needed:
   - Total potato salad needed = \( 200 + 25 = 225 \) lbs.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic."

"First, we need to determine Gerald's original time for the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, and Lee's current time is 38 seconds, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's current time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to calculate Gerald's new time after his speed improved by 10%. An improvement in speed by 10% means that Gerald can now run 110% of the distance in the same time. Therefore, his new time is:

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = \text{Gerald's original time} \times \frac{100\%}{110\%} = 40 \text{ seconds} \times \frac{100}{110} = 40 \text{ seconds} \times \frac{10}{11} = \frac{400}{11} \text{ seconds} \approx 36.36 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in:

"Given that the number of dogs is 60, and there are two cats for every dog, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we first find the combined number of dogs and cats:

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120
Combined number of dogs and cats = 180

The number of rabbits is twelve less than this combined number:

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the Grade 5 class.

The total number of students is 200. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the rest of the students are girls, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. According to the problem, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout:

\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:

\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scout is 40."

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the volume of tomatoes before they are cooked into sauce.
2. Calculate the number of cans of tomatoes used.
3. Calculate the number of tomatoes used based on the number of cans.

First, we know that the sauce made is 32 ounces, and the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked. This means that the volume of the tomatoes before cooking was twice the volume of the sauce. So, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking is:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes were used to get 64 ounces of tomatoes. The number of cans is:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is:
\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We start with 30 cars on the motorway.
2. After 15 minutes, some cars drive through the traffic jam.
3. In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through the traffic jam.
4. Additionally, 5 cars take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in both 15-minute intervals is \( x + 20 \).

Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that actually drove through the traffic jam is the total number of cars minus the 5 that took an exit. This can be expressed as:
\[ 30 - 5 = 25 \]

Therefore, we have the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

Final numerical answer:

"Mary initially has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, the total number of potted plants she has before receiving the new ones is:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Yesterday, she received 18 new potted plants. Adding these to her existing plants gives:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Tomorrow, she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family. Since there are 40 window ledges, she will give away:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Subtracting the plants she will give away from her total gives:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

Mary will remain with 58 potted plants."
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and then sum these numbers.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we sum the number of doorbell rings from all friends:
\[20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175\]

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."

"John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner every weekday, and he also has a glass of water before bed. That's 4 glasses of water per day for 5 days (Monday through Friday).

So, for the weekdays, he drinks:
4 glasses/day * 5 days = 20 glasses

On the weekends, he drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed, but not with dinner. That's 3 glasses of water per day for 2 days (Saturday and Sunday).

So, for the weekends, he drinks:
3 glasses/day * 2 days = 6 glasses

Adding the weekday and weekend water consumption together:
20 glasses (weekdays) + 6 glasses (weekends) = 26 glasses

We know that the fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles. We need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles.

First, we set up the proportion:

\[
\frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{x \text{ minutes}}{42 \text{ miles}}
\]

To solve for \(x\), we can cross-multiply and then divide:

\[
10 \times 42 = 3 \times x
\]

\[
420 = 3x
\]

\[
x = \frac{420}{3}
\]

\[
x = 140
\]

So, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"First, let's determine how many pieces Poppy places on the board. Since she places a quarter of the pieces, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \]

So, Poppy places 250 pieces on the board. This leaves:

\[ 1000 - 250 = 750 \]

Next, Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining pieces. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \]

After her mom places these pieces, the number of pieces left to be placed is:

\[ 750 - 250 = 500 \]

Therefore, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is:

\[ 500 \]"

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box, then find its inner volume, and finally multiply by 3 for the total volume of all 3 boxes.

Given that the walls are 1 inch thick, the inner dimensions of each box will be reduced by 2 inches in each dimension (1 inch from each side).

So, the inner dimensions of each box are:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

The inner volume of one box is calculated as:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 3 \, \text{inches} \times 4 \, \text{inches} \times 2 \, \text{inches} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 24 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
\[ \text{Total Volume} = 24 \, \text{cubic inches/box} \times 3 \, \text{boxes} \]
\[ \text{Total Volume} = 72 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches."
"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the total hours of TV he watched each day and then solve for the unknown.

1. **Monday and Tuesday**: 1 hour each night, so 2 hours total.
2. **Thursday**: 1 hour + 0.5 hours (30 minutes), so 1.5 hours.
3. **Friday**: 2 hours (2 episodes of 1 hour each).

Adding these up:
- Monday + Tuesday + Thursday + Friday = 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. So, the remaining hours watched on Wednesday are:
- 7 hours (total) - 5.5 hours (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday) = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes (0.5 hours), we can find the number of episodes by dividing the remaining hours by the length of each episode:
- 1.5 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 3 episodes.

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

**Final Answer: 3**"
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies.

However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he had left is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \).

We know that after dropping 5 cookies, he had 110 cookies left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The final amount for 10 gallons of gas, after the cashback rewards, is \$28.00."
"To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate in total, we need to calculate the area of each roll-up sheet they had.

For Beatrice:
- The roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- The total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice had is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

For Marcell:
- The roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- The total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell had is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Now, we add the number of fruit roll-ups each of them ate to find the total:
- Total fruit roll-ups eaten = \(48 + 42 = 90\).

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by each person, we divide the total by 2:
- Average = \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\).

Therefore, on average, they ate 45 fruit roll-ups."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many feet Julia rows to reach the shore and then calculate the amount of water that enters the boat based on the given rate.

First, we find out how many feet Julia rows in 64 seconds. We know that it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, the rate at which she rows is:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} \]

Now, we calculate the total distance she rows in 64 seconds:

\[ \text{Distance} = \left(\frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}}\right) \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the rate at which water enters the boat, which is 2 liters for every 10 feet rowed. To find out how much water enters the boat over 80 feet, we use the following calculation:

\[ \text{Water} = \left(\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
2. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. So, Brittany's phone can hold \( \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \) photographs.
3. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as \( D \). Therefore, we have the equation: \( 300 = 50D \).
4. Solving for \( D \), we get \( D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \).

So, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is 6.

"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue from selling it, then find the difference between the two.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought:

1. **2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Cost per board: $10
   - Number of boards: 10
   - Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards: \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \) dollars

2. **4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Cost per board: $16
   - Number of boards: 5
   - Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards: \( 16 \times 5 = 80 \) dollars

Total cost of all the lumber:
\[ 100 + 80 = 180 \] dollars

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:

1. **2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Since the prices have gone up 50%, the new price per board is:
     \[ 10 + (10 \times 0.50) = 10 + 5 = 15 \] dollars
   - Number of boards: 10
   - Total revenue for 2 x 4 x 10 boards: \( 15 \times 10 = 150 \) dollars

2. **4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Since the prices have gone up 50%, the new price per board is:
     \[ 16 + (16 \times 0.50) = 16 + 8 = 24 \] dollars
   - Number of boards: 5
   - Total revenue for 4 x 4 x 10 boards: \( 24 \times 5 = 120 \) dollars

Total revenue from selling all the lumber:
\[ 150 + 120 = 270 \] dollars

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 270 - 180 = 90 \] dollars

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of \(\boxed{90}\) dollars."
"Given the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, we can represent the amount of sugar and water used as 7x and 13x respectively, where x is a common multiplier.

The total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 13x = 120\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[20x = 120\]

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now, to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used, we multiply the value of x by 7 (since the ratio of sugar is 7 parts):

\[7x = 7 \times 6 = 42\]

Therefore, Katy used 42 teaspoonfuls of sugar."
"John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children. Since each pair of shoes costs $60, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

1. First, find the total number of pairs of shoes: \(2 \text{ pairs/child} \times 3 \text{ children} = 6 \text{ pairs}\).
2. Then, calculate the total cost: \(6 \text{ pairs} \times \$60/\text{pair} = \$360\).

Therefore, John paid $360."
"On the first day, the customs officer counted 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles on the first day is:

2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

On the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day:

30 vehicles (total on the second day) - 10 vehicles (from the first day) = 20 vehicles

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:

20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.
   - Let Lylah's salary four years ago be \( L \).
   - Therefore, \( 40,000 = L + 0.30L \).
   - This simplifies to \( 40,000 = 1.30L \).
   - Solving for \( L \), we get \( L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} \approx 30,769.23 \).

2. **Determine Adrien's salary four years later:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Four years later, his salary increased by 40%.
   - Therefore, Adrien's new salary is \( 40,000 + 0.40 \times 40,000 = 40,000 \times 1.40 = 56,000 \).

3. **Determine Lylah's salary four years later:**
   - Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.
   - Assuming her salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's (40%), her new salary is \( 30,769.23 + 0.40 \times 30,769.23 = 30,769.23 \times 1.40 \approx 43,076.92 \).

4. **Calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:**
   - Adrien's new salary: $56,000
   - Lylah's new salary: $43,076.92
   - Total salary: \( 56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92 \).

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is $99,076.92."

2. Her husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.
4. After using the spoons, she had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as \( x \).

So, the total number of spoons Julia had before using any was:
\[ x + 5 \]

After using 3 spoons, she had:
\[ (x + 5) - 3 = 12 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]
\[ x + 2 = 12 \]
\[ x = 12 - 2 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

"Given that each pepper costs $15, we can calculate the cost of the other items based on this information.

1. **Cost of a watermelon:**
   - A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.
   - Therefore, the cost of a watermelon = 3 * $15 = $45.

2. **Cost of an orange:**
   - An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs.
   - Therefore, the cost of an orange = $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the items Dillon is buying:

- **Cost of 4 watermelons:**
  - 4 * $45 = $180.

- **Cost of 20 peppers:**
  - 20 * $15 = $300.

- **Cost of 10 oranges:**

"Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as \( B \) and the number of pink gumballs as \( P \).

According to the problem, the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs. This can be written as:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

We are given that there are 12 blue gumballs, so \( B = 12 \).

Substituting \( B = 12 \) into the equation:
\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

Therefore, there are 70 pink gumballs.

Final numerical answer:
70"
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many cars are semi-automatic. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. 

So, the number of semi-automatic cars is:
20 (total cars) - 12 (automatic cars) - 4 (manual cars) = 4 semi-automatic cars.

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

Therefore, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic."
"Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \)
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \)

We also know the total number of bees in the hive is 700:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting the relationships into the total number of bees equation:
\[ 2B + B + \frac{B}{2} = 700 \]

Combining like terms:
\[ 2B + B + \frac{B}{2} = 700 \]
\[ 3B + \frac{B}{2} = 700 \]
\[ \frac{6B + B}{2} = 700 \]
\[ \frac{7B}{2} = 700 \]
\[ 7B = 1400 \]
\[ B = 200 \]

Now, we can find the number of worker bees:
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is 400."
"First, let's calculate how many hours Jordan spends playing video games in a week. Since he plays for 2 hours every day, and there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total hours spent playing video games as follows:

\[ 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{hours/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jordan would earn if he spent those 14 hours working instead of playing video games. Since he earns $10 per hour at his part-time job, we can calculate his earnings as follows:

\[ 14 \, \text{hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$140/\text{week} \]

Therefore, if Jordan spent his video game time working instead, he would earn \(\boxed{140}\) dollars in one week."
"First, let's identify the food and non-food items from the list:

- Milk: Food item (2 dollars)
- Eggs: Food item (3 dollars)
- Light bulbs: Non-food item (3 dollars)
- Cups: Non-food item (3 dollars)
- Roach traps: Non-food item (4 dollars)

Next, we calculate the total cost of the non-food items before tax:
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars

Total cost of non-food items = 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Now, we apply the 10% tax to the non-food items:
Tax on non-food items = 10% of 10 dollars = 0.10 * 10 = 1 dollar

So, the total cost of the non-food items after tax is:
10 dollars (original cost) + 1 dollar (tax) = 11 dollars

Now, we add the cost of the food items to the total cost of the non-food items after tax:
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars
- Total cost of food items = 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Total cost of everything = Cost of food items + Cost of non-food items after tax
Total cost of everything = 5 dollars + 11 dollars = 16 dollars

Final numerical answer:
16 dollars"
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have:

- Kim already has 3 clients.
- He is talking to 5 potential clients.
- Therefore, the total number of clients will be \(3 + 5 = 8\).

Next, we calculate the total expenses for the supplies:

- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
- The cost of 1 bottle of bleach is $2.
- The cost of 1 pack of cloths is $5.
- Therefore, the cost for supplies per client is \(2 \times 2 + 1 \times 5 = 4 + 5 = 9\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total expenses for all clients:

- The total number of clients is 8.
- The cost per client is $9.
- Therefore, the total expenses are \(8 \times 9 = 72\) dollars.

Kim's total income each week is $92. 

Finally, we calculate the profit:

- Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses.
- Therefore, the profit is \(92 - 72 = 20\) dollars.

So, the profit Kim will make each week is $20."
"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare that John can harvest in one harvest.
2. Determine how many harvests John can make in a year.
3. Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the number of harvests in a year to get the total number of pineapples harvested in a year.

Step 1: Pineapples per hectare per harvest
- There are 100 pineapples per hectare.

Step 2: Number of harvests in a year
- John can harvest every 3 months, which means there are 4 harvests in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest).

Step 3: Total pineapples harvested in a year
- Total pineapples = (Pineapples per hectare per harvest) * (Number of hectares) * (Number of harvests in a year)
- Total pineapples = 100 * 10 * 4
- Total pineapples = 4000

Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year."
"Johnny has three Lego sets to pick up. 

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, which is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, which is \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

To find the total number of pieces Johnny picks up, we add the pieces from all three sets:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

Johnny picks up 2125 blocks."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return, which is 15 bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the first 6 hours leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
4. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first 6 hours and did not return in the second 6 hours return to the hive. Since 15 bees returned in the second 6 hours, 30 - 15 = 15 bees did not return in the second 6 hours. These 15 bees return in the last 6 hours.

So, in the last 6 hours, 15 bees return to the hive.

Final numerical answer:

"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we first need to calculate the total cost of the tickets.

The cost for 1 child ticket is $10, and the cost for 1 adult ticket is $12. So, the total cost for both tickets is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$10 + \$12 = \$22 \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means the amount she gave the cashier minus the total cost of the tickets equals $8. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ \text{Amount given} - \text{Total cost} = \text{Change} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Amount given} - \$22 = \$8 \]

To find the amount given, we add $22 to $8:

\[ \text{Amount given} = \$22 + \$8 = \$30 \]

So, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up some equations based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, so Charlie has \( 3D \) friends.
- James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, so James has \( 4D \) friends.
- Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook, so we can write the equation \( 3D = 12 \).

Now, we solve for \( D \):
\[ 3D = 12 \]
\[ D = \frac{12}{3} \]
\[ D = 4 \]

So, Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends. Now, we can find out how many friends James has:
\[ 4D = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Therefore, James has 16 Facebook friends.

"To determine how long the winner will wait for the loser, we need to calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: 3 miles = 3 * 5280 feet = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles = 2 * 5280 feet = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Steve's time: \( \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet per minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \)
- Tim's time: \( \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet per minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \)

Since Steve is the winner, we need to find out how long he will wait for Tim:
- Difference in time: \( 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \)

Therefore, the winner (Steve) will be waiting for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

"To calculate how much Shawnda made that day, we need to determine the total number of tires inflated and then convert that into dollars based on the cost per tire.

1. **Bicycles**: Each bicycle has 2 tires. On the first day, 5 people came by to get both tires inflated.
   - Total tires from bicycles: \(5 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ tires/person} = 10 \text{ tires}\)

2. **Tricycles**: Each tricycle has 3 tires. On the first day, 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated.
   - Total tires from tricycles: \(3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ tires/person} = 9 \text{ tires}\)

3. **Unicycle**: A unicycle has 1 tire. On the first day, 1 person came by to get their unicycle tire inflated.
   - Total tires from unicycle: \(1 \text{ person} \times 1 \text{ tire/person} = 1 \text{ tire}\)

Now, we add up all the tires:
- Total tires inflated: \(10 \text{ tires (bicycles)} + 9 \text{ tires (tricycles)} + 1 \text{ tire (unicycle)} = 20 \text{ tires}\)

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. To find out how much Shawnda made, we multiply the total number of tires by the cost per tire:
- Total cost: \(20 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 500 \text{ cents}\)

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost to dollars:
- Total dollars: \(500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 5 \text{ dollars}\)

Therefore, Shawnda made \(\boxed{5}\) dollars that day."

"Let's work through the problem step by step, starting from the end and moving backwards.

1. **Final state**: 5 fries are left.
2. **Before the ants carried off the last fry**: There were 6 fries (since the ants carried off 1 fry).
3. **Before the raccoon stole two-thirds of the fries**: Let's denote the number of fries before the raccoon stole as \( x \). The raccoon stole two-thirds, so one-third remained. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{3}x = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 6 \times 3 = 18 \).
4. **Before the three pigeons ate their share**: Each pigeon ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries. Therefore, before the pigeons ate, there were \( 18 + 9 = 27 \) fries.
5. **Before the seagull ate half of what Dave ate**: Let's denote the number of fries the seagull ate as \( y \). The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, so Dave ate \( 2y \). The seagull ate \( y \) fries, and Dave ate \( 2y \) fries, so the total before the seagull ate was \( 27 + y \). Since the seagull ate half of what Dave ate, we have \( y = 14 \) (since Dave ate 14 fries before the seagull). Therefore, the total before the seagull ate was \( 27 + 14 = 41 \).
6. **Before Dave ate his 14 fries**: The total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \( 41 + 14 = 55 \).

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the hours for the days he has three 1-hour classes:
- He has three 1-hour classes each on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.
- So, for these three days, he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours per day.
- Over three days, that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the hours for the days he has two 2-hour classes:
- He has two 2-hour classes each on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
- So, for these two days, he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours per day.
- Over two days, that's \(2 \times 4 = 8\) hours.

Now, let's add the hours from both types of days to get the total weekly hours:
- Total weekly hours = \(9 + 8 = 17\) hours.

Finally, to find the total hours for the entire semester, we multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks in the semester:
- There are 16 weeks in the semester.
- So, the total hours in one semester = \(17 \times 16 = 272\) hours.

Therefore, Kimo spends 272 hours attending classes in one semester."
"To find the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end, we need to calculate the length contributed by each type of baked good and then sum these lengths.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Number of rolls: 300
   - Length of each roll: 4 inches
   - Total length of rolls: \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Number of croissants: 120
   - Length of each croissant: 6 inches
   - Total length of croissants: \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Number of baguettes: 60
   - Length of each baguette: 2 feet (which is 24 inches)
   - Total length of baguettes: \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches

Now, we sum the total lengths in inches:
\[1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 \text{ inches}\]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[3360 \div 12 = 280 \text{ feet}\]

Therefore, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is 280 feet."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we first calculate the monthly requirement for each type of ape and then double it for the 2-month period.

1. **Monkeys' Requirement:**
   - Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(200 \times 2 = 400\) bananas.

2. **Gorillas' Requirement:**
   - Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(400 \times 2 = 800\) bananas.

3. **Baboons' Requirement:**
   - Baboons need 100 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(100 \times 2 = 200\) bananas.

Now, we add up the total number of bananas needed for all the apes over 2 months:
\[400 \text{ (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas}\]

"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Since the football field is 100 yards long, running back and forth once is 200 yards. Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so the total distance Blake runs is:

\[ 200 \, \text{yards} \times 15 = 3000 \, \text{yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards, and she does this 34 times, so the total distance Kelly runs is:

\[ 80 \, \text{yards} \times 34 = 2720 \, \text{yards} \]

Now, we need to find out how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Since Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards, the difference in the distance they run is:

\[ 3000 \, \text{yards} - 2720 \, \text{yards} = 280 \, \text{yards} \]

Therefore, the winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser."

"Finn initially watches 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 of them come out from under a lily pad, and 2 of them hide under a rock. 

To find out how many tadpoles Finn can see now, we need to consider the following:

- Initially, all 11 tadpoles are in the pond.
- 6 tadpoles come out from under the lily pad, so now there are 11 - 6 = 5 tadpoles that are still hidden.
- Then, 2 of the hidden tadpoles (from the 5 that were hidden) hide under a rock, so now there are 5 - 2 = 3 tadpoles that are still hidden.

Therefore, the number of tadpoles Finn can see now is the initial 11 minus the 3 that are now hidden, which is 11 - 3 = 8.

Finn can see 8 tadpoles in the pond now."

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

First, let's determine how many times the price will increase in 36 months. Since the price increases every two months, we divide 36 by 2:

\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

So, the price will increase 18 times.

The original price of the bag of marbles is $20. Each time the price increases, it increases by 20% of the original price. This means each increase is:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \]

So, each increase adds $4 to the price. After 18 increases, the total increase in price is:

\[ 18 \times 4 = 72 \]

Therefore, the final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is the original price plus the total increase:

\[ 20 + 72 = 92 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{92} \]"

First, let's calculate the total cost of the red cars:
5 red cars * $4 per car = $20

Next, calculate the total cost of the action figures:
3 action figures * $5 per figure = $15

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5, the doll costs:
3 action figures * $5 per figure = $15

Now, add up the total cost of all the toys:
$20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) + $15 (doll) = $50

Therefore, the total worth of all the toys is $50."

"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she has chosen and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's add up the costs of the items:
- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €102
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 + €74 + €102

Now, let's perform the addition step by step:
1. €1090 + €157 = €1247
2. €1247 + €74 = €1321
3. €1321 + €102 = €1423
4. €1423 + €74 = €1497
5. €1497 + €102 = €1599

The total cost of the items is €1599. However, Elvira's budget is only €1500. Since the total cost exceeds her budget, she will not have any money left for clothing. In fact, she will be short by €99.

Therefore, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is:

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

We can simplify the second equation:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:
\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the hat is given as $25.
2. The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so:
   \[
   \text{Cost of jacket} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so:
   \[
   \text{Cost of pants} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. Therefore, Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Therefore, Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we need to find the total age of the four birds:

- Sally Two: 19 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years

Adding these together:

\[19 + 8 + 16 + 8 = 41\]

The total age of the four birds is 41 years."
"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum on all her debts each month, we first need to calculate the total minimum monthly payment and then find 50% more of that amount.

1. Calculate the total minimum monthly payment:
   - Student loans: $300
   - Credit card: $200
   - Mortgage: $500
   - Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

2. Calculate 50% more than the total minimum monthly payment:
   - 50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500
   - Total payment per month = $1000 + $500 = $1500

3. Calculate the total payment for a year:
   - Total payment per year = $1500 * 12 = $18000

Therefore, Jessica pays $18000 in a year."
"To calculate the total time Billy will take to prep the potatoes, we need to consider the time it takes to peel each potato and the time it takes to cut each potato.

1. Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
2. Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

First, we calculate the total time to peel all 60 potatoes:
\[ 60 \text{ potatoes} \times 1.5 \text{ minutes per potato} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the total time to cut all 60 potatoes:
\[ 60 \text{ potatoes} \times 5 \text{ seconds per potato} = 300 \text{ seconds} \]

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert the cutting time into minutes:
\[ 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds per minute} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time to peel and the time to cut:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost per gallon of lemonade:**
   - Cost of lemons per gallon: $3
   - Cost of sugar per gallon: $2
   - Total cost per gallon: $3 + $2 = $5

2. **Determine the revenue per gallon:**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50
   - They get 20 glasses per gallon
   - Revenue per gallon: 20 glasses * $0.50/glass = $10

3. **Determine the profit per gallon:**
   - Profit per gallon = Revenue per gallon - Cost per gallon
   - Profit per gallon = $10 - $5 = $5

4. **Determine the number of gallons sold to make $25 in profit:**
   - Total profit: $25
   - Profit per gallon: $5
   - Number of gallons sold: $25 / $5 = 5 gallons

"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to determine the total number of Chinese participants in the race.

Given:
- Total number of Asians: 240
- Number of Japanese: 80

The rest of the participants are Chinese, so we can calculate the number of Chinese participants as follows:
\[ \text{Number of Chinese} = \text{Total number of Asians} - \text{Number of Japanese} \]
\[ \text{Number of Chinese} = 240 - 80 = 160 \]

We are also given that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = \text{Number of Chinese} - \text{Number of boys} \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 160 - 60 = 100 \]

Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100."
"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent and car fuel.

Zaid's salary is $6000.

1. Rent: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \) dollars.
2. Car fuel: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \) dollars.

Now, let's find out how much is left after these expenses.

Remaining amount after rent and car fuel: \( 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \) dollars.

Next, Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.

Donation to charity: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \) dollars.

Now, let's find out how much is left after the donation.

Remaining amount after donation: \( 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \) dollars.

Zaid then gives his daughter $200 and his wife $700.

Total given to daughter and wife: \( 200 + 700 = 900 \) dollars.

Finally, let's calculate how much money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations.

Final amount: \( 1250 - 900 = 350 \) dollars.

Therefore, Zaid will still have $350 after all these expenses and donations."

"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we need to first find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, and Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies. Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( W \).

From the information given:
\[ 5W = 200 \]

Solving for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now, we know Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can denote the number of red roses as \( R \).

From the information given:
\[ R = 4W \]

Substituting the value of \( W \):
\[ R = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"Given that Jan is 30 years old, we can use the information provided to find Mark's age and then Jean's age.

First, let's determine Mark's age two years ago. We know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.

Jan's age two years ago was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.

Half of Jan's age two years ago was 28 / 2 = 14 years old.

So, two years ago, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.

Therefore, Mark's current age is 19 + 2 = 21 years old.

Now, we know that Jean is two years older than Mark. So, Jean's current age is 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

Jean is 23 years old."
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay race.

**Faster Team:**
Each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time for the faster team = 4 runners × 55 seconds/runner = 220 seconds.

**Less Well-Rounded Team:**
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Total time for the less well-rounded team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

**Difference in Time:**
The faster team's total time - the less well-rounded team's total time = 220 seconds - 222 seconds = -2 seconds.

Since the result is negative, it means the faster team actually wins by 2 seconds.

**Final Answer:**
The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by calculating the ratio of the probabilities and then converting it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[ \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \]

This means the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200\% \]

So, it is 200% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

**Final Answer: 200%**"

They both picked 30 apples."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and calculate the total straw used for each type of rodent.

1. **Hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = 10 cages * 5 pieces/cage = 50 pieces.

2. **Rabbits:**
   - There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.

3. **Rats:**
   - The total straw used for all small rodents is 160 pieces.
   - Subtract the straw used for hamsters and rabbits from the total: 160 - 50 - 20 = 90 pieces.
   - Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
   - Number of rats = 90 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 15 rats.
   - These 15 rats are distributed equally among 3 cages.
   - Number of rats per cage = 15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats.

Therefore, there are 5 rats in each cage."
"To calculate the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to account for the monthly interest compounded over the 3 months.

1. **Initial Amount**: $100
2. **Monthly Interest Rate**: 2% or 0.02

Let's calculate the amount after each month:

**After 1st Month:**
\[ \text{Amount} = 100 \times (1 + 0.02) = 100 \times 1.02 = 102 \]

**After 2nd Month:**
\[ \text{Amount} = 102 \times (1 + 0.02) = 102 \times 1.02 = 104.04 \]

"To determine the number of bags the trader sold, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue, and then use the profit to find the number of bags.

Let's denote the number of bags the trader bought and sold as \( x \).

1. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Cost of buying the bags: \( 20x \) dollars.
   - Cost of transporting the bags: \( 2x \) dollars.
   - Total cost: \( 20x + 2x = 22x \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - Revenue from selling the bags: \( 30x \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is given as $400.
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost.
   - Therefore, \( 30x - 22x = 400 \).
   - Simplifying, we get \( 8x = 400 \).

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \).

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The tickets cost $20.25 in total. The food cost $4.50 less than the tickets, so the food cost is:

\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the rides. Each ride costs $33, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is:

\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:

\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

"To find out how many pounds of insects ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weekly need for the flock.
2. Divide the weekly need by 7 to find the daily need.

First, the total weekly need for the flock is:
\[ 10 \text{ ducks} \times 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, to find the daily need, we divide the weekly total by 7:
\[ \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year, so the net increase is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees per year.

3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the net increase in trees is \(8 \times 10 = 80\) trees. Adding this to the initial number of trees, we get \(50 + 80 = 130\) trees.

4. **Trees that die**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, the number of trees that die is \(0.30 \times 130 = 39\) trees.

5. **Final number of trees**: Subtracting the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years, we get \(130 - 39 = 91\) trees.

Therefore, after 10 years, Tom has 91 trees left."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Placement on Friday:**
   - Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Modification on Saturday:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - So, 6 pink flamingos were taken back.
   - The remaining pink flamingos are \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).

"To find the cost of 8 pens, we first need to determine the cost of one pen.

Given:
- A pencil costs $1.20.
- An eraser costs $0.30.
- A pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined.

So, the cost of one pen is:
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \text{Cost of a pencil} + \text{Cost of an eraser} \]
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \$1.20 + \$0.30 \]
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \$1.50 \]

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens:
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \text{Cost of one pen} \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \$1.50 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = \$12.00 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. After a month, she collected three times that number, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\), so she collected \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards in the third month.

Now, let's sum up all the cards she has:

- Initial cards: 20
- Cards after the first month: 60
- Cards after the second month: 40
- Cards after the third month: 200

Total cards = Initial cards + Cards after the first month + Cards after the second month + Cards after the third month

"To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the cheese consumption for each meal and then sum them up.

1. **Sandwiches for Lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch.
   - He used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Total cheese for sandwiches = 2 slices/day * 7 days = 14 slices.

2. **Omelets for Breakfast:**
   - Carl ate an omelet 3 days in the week.
   - He used 1 more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich, so he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet.
   - Total cheese for omelets = 3 slices/omelet * 3 omelets = 9 slices.

3. **Macaroni and Cheese for Dinners:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese and used 8 slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese for macaroni and cheese = 8 slices.

Now, we sum up all the cheese used:

"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sum of the scores Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93 over 5 tests (since the lowest score will be dropped).
2. Determine the sum of the scores she has already received.
3. Calculate the score she needs on the sixth test to reach the required sum after dropping the lowest score.

First, let's calculate the total sum of scores needed for an average of 93 over 5 tests:
\[ 93 \times 5 = 465 \]

Next, we sum up the scores Brinley has already received:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438 \]

To find out the score she needs on the sixth test, we need to consider that the lowest score among the six will be dropped. The current lowest score is 71. If she scores 71 or less on the sixth test, 71 will be the lowest score and will be dropped. If she scores more than 71, the lowest score among the five will be dropped.

Let's assume she scores \( x \) on the sixth test. The sum of the scores after dropping the lowest score will be:
\[ 438 + x - 71 = 367 + x \]

We need this sum to be 465:
\[ 367 + x = 465 \]
\[ x = 465 - 367 \]
\[ x = 98 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 98 on her sixth test to get an average of 93 after dropping the lowest score.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the distance for each period and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the distance for the first four weeks:
- He rode 5 times a week.
- Each ride was 25 kilometers.
- He did this for 4 weeks.

So, the distance for the first four weeks is:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance for the following three weeks:
- He rode 2 times a week.
- Each ride was 60 kilometers.
- He did this for 3 weeks.

So, the distance for the next three weeks is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ km/ride} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km} \]

Now, we add the distances from both periods to get the total distance:
\[ 500 \text{ km} + 360 \text{ km} = 860 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the total kilometers Micheal did is:
\[ \boxed{860} \]"
"Each chocolate bar weighs 40g, and since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 20g.

Joe has 25 chocolate bars, so the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars * 40g/chocolate bar = 1000g

Joe also has 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 candied apples * 20g/candied apple = 1600g

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is the sum of the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

Therefore, Joe's bag of candy weighs 2600 grams."
"On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

To find the total number of cakes she bought after all three days, we add the number of cakes bought each day:

\(4 + 12 + 60 = 76\)

So, Rose bought a total of 76 cakes after all three days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates would be 6 plates.
   - Therefore, the cost of half a dozen plates is \(6 \times 6000 = 36000\) dollars.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is \(36000 - 1200 = 34800\) dollars.

3. **Determine the cost of one dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups cost $34800.
   - Therefore, one dozen cups cost \(\frac{34800}{20} = 1740\) dollars.

4. **Determine the cost of one cup:**
   - One dozen cups is 12 cups.
   - Therefore, the cost of one cup is \(\frac{1740}{12} = 145\) dollars.

The total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{145}\) dollars."
"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

1. The cost of the jacket is $30.
2. The cost of 2 pairs of shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
3. Therefore, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, we need to calculate how much money Sara will earn from babysitting and mowing the lawn, and how much she already has saved.

1. Sara babysits 4 times, earning $5 each time, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.
2. Let \(x\) be the number of times she mows the lawn. She earns $4 each time, so she earns \(4x\) dollars from mowing the lawn.
3. Sara already has $10 saved.

The total amount of money Sara will have after babysitting and mowing the lawn is \(10 + 20 + 4x = 30 + 4x\) dollars.

We need this total to be at least $70, so we set up the inequality:
\[30 + 4x \geq 70\]

To find \(x\), we solve the inequality:
\[4x \geq 70 - 30\]
\[4x \geq 40\]
\[x \geq 10\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

Final numerical answer:
4"
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, as he is walking around the edge. The park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles by 6 miles.

The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we divide the total distance by his speed:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Gary spends 5 hours walking."
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we need to subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total.

So, the number of customers on the third day is \(500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\).

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. We know that both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 \) gallons. This can be written as:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we have:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool now has \( 8 \) gallons of water.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the shoes and the belt is $352.00.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Her part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find the number of hours, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. First, let's calculate the total amount she promised to return:

\[ \text{Total amount} = \$2000 + (10\% \times \$2000) = \$2000 + \$200 = \$2200 \]

Janeth is going to pay $165 a month for 12 months. Let's calculate the total amount she will pay over these 12 months:

\[ \text{Total payment} = \$165 \times 12 = \$1980 \]

Now, to find out her remaining balance, we subtract the total payment from the total amount she promised to return:

\[ \text{Remaining balance} = \$2200 - \$1980 = \$220 \]

Janeth's remaining balance by then will be $220."
"There are 4 roses in the vase. There are 7 more dahlias than roses, so there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias. 

To find the total number of flowers, we add the number of roses and dahlias together: 4 + 11 = 15.

Total number of flowers in the vase: 15."
"Given that Harriet is currently 21 years old, we can determine the ages of Adrian and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's age = 21 years
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age = 21 * 2 = 42 years
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's age = 21 * 3 = 63 years

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet's age = 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack's age = 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian's age = 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \]

The average age of the three in three years is 45 years."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna, and then subtract the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the overall total.

1. **Naomi's Points:**
   Naomi scored 68 points.

2. **Brianna's Points:**
   Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's points} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

3. **Yuri's Points:**
   Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. First, we find half of Naomi's points:
   \[
   \text{Half of Naomi's points} = \frac{68}{2} = 34
   \]
   Then, we add 10 to this value:
   \[
   \text{Yuri's points} = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]

4. **Total Points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:**
   We sum up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
   \[
   \text{Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna} = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197

"Initially, the water tank has 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters of water, so the amount of water left in the tank is:

120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters

Celine then collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left in the tank. Therefore, the amount of rainwater collected is:

2 * 30 liters = 60 liters

Adding the rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives:

30 liters + 60 liters = 90 liters

So, the final amount of water in the tank is:

90 liters"

Therefore, Andrew will travel for 9 days."
"First, let's calculate the new total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type cards and buying 14 grass type cards.

Initial count:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20
- Water type: 40

After the changes:
- Fire type: 30 (unchanged)
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

Now, let's find the total number of cards:
Total cards = 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96

Next, we calculate the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \frac{3200}{96} \]
\[ \text{Percentage} \approx 33.33 \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest after two months.
2. Subtract the number of harvested watermelons from the total to find the remaining watermelons.
3. Calculate how many of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks.
4. Subtract the number of harvested watermelons after two weeks from the remaining watermelons to find the final number of watermelons not ready for harvest.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest after two months:
   \[
   30\% \text{ of } 120 = 0.30 \times 120 = 36
   \]
   So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest after two months.

2. Subtract the number of harvested watermelons from the total to find the remaining watermelons:
   \[
   120 - 36 = 84
   \]
   So, 84 watermelons remained after the first harvest.

3. Calculate how many of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \text{ of } 84 = \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63
   \]
   So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks.

4. Subtract the number of harvested watermelons after two weeks from the remaining watermelons to find the final number of watermelons not ready for harvest:
   \[
   84 - 63 = 21

Therefore, the number of melons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is 21."
"To calculate the total amount Mark pays for everything, we need to consider the cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees.

1. **Cost of the cars**: 12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000
2. **Tax on the cars**: 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000
3. **Registration fees**: $1,000 per car * 12 cars = $12,000

Now, we add these amounts together to get the total cost:

$240,000 (cost of cars) + $24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (registration fees) = $276,000

Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for everything is $276,000."

"Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. Since he eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes per day. Together, they eat 6 (Steve) + 3 (girlfriend) = 9 tomatoes per day.

To find out how many tomatoes they need in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 tomatoes/week.

Since a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed to produce 63 tomatoes is:
63 tomatoes / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines.

Steve needs 21 vines to meet their tomato consumption."

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens.
2. **First Cycle of Refilling**: After using these 25 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make 5 new pens (since 25 / 5 = 5).
3. **Second Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 5 new pens plus the 20 pens that were not used up in the first cycle (since 25 - 5 = 20). So, he has 25 pens again. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make 5 new pens again.
4. **Third Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 5 new pens plus the 20 pens that were not used up in the second cycle (since 25 - 5 = 20). So, he has 25 pens again. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make 5 new pens again.
5. **Fourth Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 5 new pens plus the 20 pens that were not used up in the third cycle (since 25 - 5 = 20). So, he has 25 pens again. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make 5 new pens again.
6. **Fifth Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 5 new pens plus the 20 pens that were not used up in the fourth cycle (since 25 - 5 = 20). So, he has 25 pens again. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make 5 new pens again.

After the fifth cycle, he will have 5 new pens plus the 20 pens that were not used up in the fifth cycle (since 25 - 5 = 20). So, he has 25 pens again. However, he cannot make any more new pens because he needs 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen, and he only has 25 pens, which is not enough to make another 5 pens.

So, the total number of pens he gets to have is the sum of the pens he initially bought and the pens he made through the refilling process:

\[ 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 40 \]

Therefore, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"Johnny started with an allowance of $20 and added an extra $10, so he had a total of:

To find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we add Jessa's age, Joan's age, and Mary's age together:

20 + 25 + 23 = 68.

The sum of the ages of the three girls is 68."
"To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.
2. Calculate the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A.
3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students.
4. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C, which is the remaining students after those who went out through exits A and B.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Number of students who went out through exit A:**
   30% of 1000 students went out through exit A.
   \[
   0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]
   So, 300 students went out through exit A.

2. **Number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A:**
   \[
   1000 - 300 = 700
   \]
   So, 700 students remained.

3. **Number of students who went out through exit B:**
   3/5 of the remaining 700 students went out through exit B.
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
   \]
   So, 420 students went out through exit B.

4. **Number of students who went out through exit C:**
   The rest of the students went out through exit C.
   \[
   700 - 420 = 280

So, the total number of books read by Dolly is 2 (her own) + 1 (Pandora's) = 3 books.
The total number of books read by Pandora is 1 (her own) + 2 (Dolly's) = 3 books.

Collectively, they will read 3 (Dolly's total) + 3 (Pandora's total) = 6 books.

By the end, they will collectively read 6 books."
"Mike was originally pen pals with 5 people and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. This means he is now pen pals with 3 people.

Each of these 3 people sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each person sends 10 pages of letters a week (2 letters * 5 pages each).

Since Mike is pen pals with 3 people, he receives a total of 30 pages of letters a week (3 people * 10 pages each).

Mike responds in kind, so he writes 30 pages of letters a week as well.

Given that Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, we can calculate the total time he spends writing a week.

Total pages written per week = 30 pages
Time to write one page = 6 minutes
Total time spent writing per week = 30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

Total time spent writing per week in hours = 180 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours

Therefore, Mike spends 3 hours writing a week."
"First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason uses for his 15-minute calls with his boss each day. Since there are 30 days in the month, he uses:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes he used for calls to other people:

\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the monthly plan of 1000 minutes:

\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Jason has 250 minutes left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin now has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Griffin now has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries.
4. Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. So, Griffin now has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Griffin now has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

**Final Answer:**
20"
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

The total number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 4 + 32 = 36 \).

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. The difference in the number of snails is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times (2F) \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The number of fish in each aquarium is 7."
"To calculate the total amount Jean paid for the makeup services, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily cost of the makeup artist's services.
2. Calculate the weekly cost of the makeup artist's services.
3. Calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks of work.
4. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.

Let's start with the daily cost:

- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
- It takes 6 hours each day to do the makeup.
- Therefore, the daily cost is \( 250 \times 6 = 1500 \) dollars.

Next, we calculate the weekly cost:

- The makeup artist needs to do the makeup 4 times a week.
- Therefore, the weekly cost is \( 1500 \times 4 = 6000 \) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks of work:

- The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
- Therefore, the total cost before the discount is \( 6000 \times 5 = 30000 \) dollars.

Finally, we apply the 10% discount:

- The discount is 10% of the total cost.
- Therefore, the discount amount is \( 30000 \times 0.10 = 3000 \) dollars.
- The final amount Jean paid is \( 30000 - 3000 = 27000 \) dollars.

So, Jean paid a total of $27,000."
"To find out how much each person paid, we first need to calculate the total cost of the party supplies.

The total cost is the sum of the costs for each item:
- Cake ingredients: $12
- Birthday presents: $43
- Decorations: $15
- Invitations: $4
- Goodie bags: $22

Adding these together:
$12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, so the cost is divided among 3 people.

To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3:
$96 ÷ 3 = $32

Each person paid $32."
"The chef bought 4 bags of onions, with each bag weighing 50 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of onions is:

4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Sue ate twice as many as her sister, so she ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

Sue's total cookies: \(20 + 26 = 46\)
Sue's sister's total cookies: \(5 + 13 = 18\)

Next, we calculate the calories consumed by each. Since each cookie has 200 calories:

Sue's total calories: \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories
Sue's sister's total calories: \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed:

\(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories

Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."
"To find the number of boys in the third class, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of students in the school:**
   - There are 3 classes, each with 20 students.
   - Total students = 3 classes * 20 students/class = 60 students.

2. **Total number of boys and girls in the school:**
   - The school is 50% boys and 50% girls.
   - Number of boys = 50% of 60 = 0.5 * 60 = 30 boys.
   - Number of girls = 50% of 60 = 0.5 * 60 = 30 girls.

3. **Number of girls in the first and second classes:**
   - First class has 15 girls.
   - Second class has 12 girls.
   - Total girls in the first and second classes = 15 + 12 = 27 girls.

4. **Number of girls in the third class:**
   - Total girls in the school = 30 girls.
   - Girls in the third class = Total girls - Girls in the first and second classes = 30 - 27 = 3 girls.

5. **Number of boys in the third class:**
   - Each class has 20 students.
   - Boys in the third class = Total students in the third class - Girls in the third class = 20 - 3 = 17 boys.

**Final answer:**
17 boys are in the third class."

"Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's denote the number of cougars killed today as \( C \). Therefore, the number of wolves killed today is \( 3C \).

We also know that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, \( C = 15 - 3 = 12 \).

Now, we can calculate the number of wolves killed today:
\[ 3C = 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

So, today Rick killed 36 wolves and 12 cougars.

To find the total number of animals Rick killed over the two days, we add the animals killed last night and today:
\[ 10 \text{ (wolves)} + 15 \text{ (cougars)} + 36 \text{ (wolves)} + 12 \text{ (cougars)} = 73 \]

Therefore, the total number of animals Rick killed is:

"First, we need to determine how many times Anne went down the slide. Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we calculate 30% of Mitchel's 30 times:

\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide 9 times less than Mitchel. Therefore, the number of times Anne went down the slide is:

\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Next, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, so we multiply Anne's count by 4:

\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 84 \]"
"Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each. This means there are a total of:

\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, each stall gets:

\[ \frac{40}{20} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Adding these 2 new cows to the original 20 cows in each stall, each stall now has:

\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ cows} \]

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8:

\[ 22 \times 8 = 176 \]

Therefore, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:

176"
"To find out how much money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the total value of each type of coin and bill, and then sum these values.

Brady has $45.00 in his piggy bank."
"First, let's calculate the total number of 10-foot sections in the 200-foot tall redwood:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any of it is:

\[ 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Termites ate 30% of the redwood, so they ate:

\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.30 = 2400 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the remaining weight of the redwood is:

\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5600 \text{ pounds} \]"

"Given that Andrea has 52 apples, we can start by determining how many apples Jamal has. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Andrea's apples} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]

Substituting the number of apples Andrea has:

\[ 52 = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]

Solving for Jamal's apples:

\[ \text{Jamal's apples} = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

Next, we know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. So, we can calculate the number of bananas Jamal has:

\[ \text{Jamal's bananas} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can find the number of bananas Andrea has:

\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{\text{Jamal's bananas}}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits:

\[ \text{Total fruits} = \text{Andrea's apples} + \text{Andrea's bananas} + \text{Jamal's apples} + \text{Jamal's bananas} \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 168 \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits is 168."
"To determine how many cups of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making over the two days and then find out how much flour is required for that number of cookies.

1. Calculate the total number of cookies:

\[ \text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the number of trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of trees Harry has} = 2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand:

\[ \text{Difference} = 11 - 3 = 8 \]

Therefore, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. 

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then compare it to her budget.

1. Calculate the brokerage fee:
\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \times \$350,000 = 0.05 \times \$350,000 = \$17,500 \]

2. Calculate the transfer fee:
\[ \text{Transfer fee} = 12\% \times \$350,000 = 0.12 \times \$350,000 = \$42,000 \]

3. Calculate the total price of the house:
\[ \text{Total price} = \text{Selling price} + \text{Brokerage fee} + \text{Transfer fee} \]
\[ \text{Total price} = \$350,000 + \$17,500 + \$42,000 = \$409,500 \]

4. Determine how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Total price} - \text{Budget} \]

"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to subtract the transfer fees, brokerage fees, and the remaining loan amount from the selling price.

1. **Calculate the transfer fees:**
   Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000
   = 0.03 * $400,000
   = $12,000

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000
   = 0.05 * $400,000
   = $20,000

3. **Calculate the total fees:**
   Total fees = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee
   = $12,000 + $20,000
   = $32,000

4. **Calculate the net proceeds:**
   Net proceeds = Selling price - Total fees - Remaining loan amount
   = $400,000 - $32,000 - $250,000
   = $118,000

Therefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are $118,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and calculate the time for each part of the process.

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:** This takes 20 minutes.

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:** It takes 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees. 
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:** It takes 5 minutes less time than the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - The total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 28 minutes.
   - So, the cooking time is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

Now, we add up all the times:
- Time to heat to 300 degrees: 20 minutes
- Time to heat to 400 degrees: 28 minutes
- Time to cook the chicken: 23 minutes

Total time = \(20 + 28 + 23 = 71\) minutes.

"To find out how much the real estate agent spent on all the ads, we need to calculate the total cost for the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the newspaper ads:
- The cost per newspaper ad is $5.
- The number of newspaper ads bought is 50.
- Therefore, the total cost for newspaper ads is \(5 \times 50 = 250\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the television ads:
- The cost per television ad is $75.
- The number of television ads bought is 15.
- Therefore, the total cost for television ads is \(75 \times 15 = 1125\) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs for the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost for newspaper ads + Cost for television ads
- Total cost = \(250 + 1125 = 1375\) dollars.

The real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on buying all the ads."

2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has \(300 / 2 = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, we add the M&Ms from all three bags together:
\[300 + 312 + 150 = 762\]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows between the houses, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum them up.

1. Calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, each house has \(3 \times 2 = 6\) windows in the bedrooms.
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms is \(6 \times 2 = 12\).

2. Calculate the number of additional windows in each house:
   - There are 4 additional windows in each house.
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is \(4 \times 2 = 8\).

3. Add the windows from the bedrooms and the additional windows to get the total number of windows:
   - Total windows = Windows in bedrooms + Additional windows
   - Total windows = \(12 + 8 = 20\)

Therefore, the total number of windows between the houses is 20."

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first calculate the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette, and then subtract these from the total number of stitches to find the number of stitches for the sleeves.

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, so:
   \[
   \text{Collar stitches} = \frac{900}{10} = 90
   \]
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so:
   \[
   \text{Rosette stitches} = 2 \times 90 = 180
   \]
4. The total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. Subtracting the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette from the total gives us the stitches for the sleeves:
   \[
   \text{Sleeves stitches} = 1800 - (900 + 90 + 180) = 1800 - 1170 = 630
   \]
5. Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total sleeve stitches by 2:
   \[
   \text{Stitches per sleeve} = \frac{630}{2} = 315
   \]

Each sleeve takes 315 stitches."
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add these amounts together.

- Total cost for tomato seeds: $800
- Total cost for celery seeds: $2400
- Total cost for all seeds: $800 + $2400 = $3200

Therefore, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is $3200."
"To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each part and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\) lines from the first scene.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\) lines from the second scene.

Now, we sum up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
- Solo song: 54 lines
- First scene: 36 lines
- Second scene: 48 lines

Total lines = \(54 + 36 + 48 = 138\)

2. Determine the number of remaining cards after removing the cards with the letter A:
   \[
   \text{Remaining cards} = 80 - 32 = 48
   \]

3. Calculate the number of cards with the letter B from the remaining cards:
   \[
   \text{Cards with B} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
   \]

4. Determine the number of remaining cards after removing the cards with the letter B:
   \[
   \text{Remaining cards} = 48 - 24 = 24
   \]

5. Calculate the number of cards with the letter C from the remaining cards:
   \[
   \text{Cards with C} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15
   \]

6. The rest of the cards will have the letter D:

"To calculate the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time for digging small holes:
   - Time for one small hole = 3 minutes
   - Total time for 30 small holes = 30 * 3 minutes = 90 minutes

2. Calculate the total time for digging large holes:
   - Time for one large hole = 10 minutes
   - Total time for 15 large holes = 15 * 10 minutes = 150 minutes

3. Add the total times for small and large holes:
   - Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

4. Convert the total time from minutes to hours:
   - 240 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 4 hours

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes."
"The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 20 + 20 = 40.

40"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

Sam is currently 6 years old."
"To find out how much Peter paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the popsicles:
- Peter purchased 20 popsicles at $0.25 each.
- The total cost for the popsicles is \(20 \times 0.25 = 5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars:
- Peter purchased 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each.
- The total cost for the ice cream bars is \(4 \times 0.50 = 2\) dollars.

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of popsicles + cost of ice cream bars
- Total cost = \(5 + 2 = 7\) dollars.

Therefore, Peter paid a total of 7 dollars."
"First, let's determine the number of spots on a mamba. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can calculate the number of spots on a mamba as follows:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas, so:

\[ \text{Total spots on cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]
\[ \text{Total spots on mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of spots for all the snakes:

\[ \text{Total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots:

\[ \text{Half the number of spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

2450"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people at the soccer game:

- There are 12 team members.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 guests.
- There are also 3 coaches.

So, the total number of people is 12 (team members) + 24 (guests) + 3 (coaches) = 39 people.

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3:

39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pizza costs $15, so:

13 * $15 = $195.

Maddy will spend $195."
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones.
2. Subtract this length from the total length of the necklace to find the length occupied by the sterling silver beads.
3. Divide the length occupied by the sterling silver beads by the length of each bead to find the number of beads.

Let's start with step 1. Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace, and each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long. Therefore, the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones is:
\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we move to step 2. The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. Subtracting the length occupied by the topaz gemstones from the total length gives us the length occupied by the sterling silver beads:
\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

Finally, for step 3, each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find the number of beads, we divide the length occupied by the sterling silver beads by the length of each bead:
\[ \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{\frac{1}{4} \text{ inch/bead}} = 17 \times 4 = 68 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we add the stories from both weeks:
- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\)
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\)
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\)

Adding these totals together:
\(60 + 120 + 180 = 360\)

The total number of stories they wrote altogether is 360."

"Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents:
- 1 quarter = 25 cents
- 5 quarters = 5 * 25 = 125 cents
- 1 dime = 10 cents
- 2 dimes = 2 * 10 = 20 cents

So, the total amount of money Kelly has is:
125 cents (from quarters) + 20 cents (from dimes) = 145 cents

Now, if she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, the amount of money she will have left is:
145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents

Therefore, Kelly will have 90 cents left."
"To find the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars and then subtract the stars in the other rows.

1. Calculate the total number of stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and 2 rows of 6 stars:
   - 3 rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars
   - 2 rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars
   - Total stars in these rows: \(24 + 12 = 36\) stars

2. The total number of stars on the flag is 76. Subtract the stars in the 3 rows of 8 and 2 rows of 6 from the total:
   - \(76 - 36 = 40\) stars

3. These 40 stars are in rows of 5 stars each. To find the number of 5-star rows:
   - \(40 \div 5 = 8\) rows

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars altogether on the flag.

"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, we first need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight for 80 flagstones is:

\[ 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to carry this total weight, given that each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds. We divide the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks} \]

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour. The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover 480 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the slow lane car:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"First, let's determine how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, Izzy has:

\[ 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Now, let's find out how many medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. So, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times 39 \]

Now, we calculate the total:

\[ 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

8 packets * 5 chocolate bars per packet = 40 chocolate bars

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the adults will get:

4 adults * 6 chocolate bars per adult = 24 chocolate bars

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:

40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars

Finally, we divide the remaining chocolate bars equally among the 8 children:

16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars per child

Each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"To determine how much money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply that by her earnings rate.

1. Calculate the total time Susan works:
   - She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours.
   - She pauses for half an hour, so the actual working time is 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours.

2. Convert the working time into minutes:
   - 2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes.

3. Calculate the earnings:
   - Susan earns $5 for every 10 minutes.
   - In 150 minutes, the number of 10-minute intervals is 150 / 10 = 15.
   - Therefore, her earnings are 15 * $5 = $75.

Susan earns $75 for the online task."
"After the first three rounds, the points are as follows:
- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, which is 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, which is 21 * 2 = 42 points.

In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. So, Mike and Tony get an extra point, but Jim does not.

- Mike's new total: 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- Jim's new total: 18 points (no extra point).
- Tony's new total: 42 + 1 = 43 points.

The total points for all three players after the extra points are distributed is:
22 (Mike) + 18 (Jim) + 43 (Tony) = 83 points.

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members, each consuming 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and eating rice at both lunch and dinner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily consumption of rice by the household.
2. Determine the total weekly consumption of rice.
3. Calculate how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last based on the weekly consumption.

**Step 1: Calculate the total daily consumption of rice.**

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since each person eats rice at both lunch and dinner, each person consumes:
\[ 0.2 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 0.4 \, \text{kg/day} \]

For 5 members of the household, the total daily consumption is:
\[ 0.4 \, \text{kg/person/day} \times 5 \, \text{persons} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total weekly consumption of rice.**

There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly consumption is:
\[ 2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{kg/week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.**

To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's calculate the total number of crates sold:

- Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates.
- On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
- On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
- On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

Now, let's add these numbers together:

20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:

120 (target) - 65 (sold) = 55 crates

So, Sam was off by 55 crates from his target for the week."
"To determine how much the desk costs Carmen, we need to calculate the total amount she bids. Carmen starts with the opening bid of $200 and then each subsequent bid increases by $50. Since there are 3 other people who each bid once, Carmen will bid 3 times after them.

Let's break down the bids:

1. Opening bid: $200
2. First bid after others: $200 + $50 = $250
3. Second bid after others: $250 + $50 = $300
4. Third bid after others: $300 + $50 = $350

Now, we add up all the bids Carmen makes:

$200 (opening bid) + $250 (first bid) + $300 (second bid) + $350 (third bid) = $1100

Therefore, the desk costs Carmen $1100."
"To calculate the total cost John pays for the driving service in a year, we need to consider both the mileage charges and the monthly bonuses.

1. **Mileage Charges:**
   - Distance to work one way: 30 miles
   - Total distance per day: 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles
   - Distance per week: 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week
   - Distance per year: 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year
   - Cost per mile: $2
   - Total mileage cost per year: 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000

2. **Monthly Bonuses:**
   - Bonus per month: $150
   - Number of months in a year: 12
   - Total bonus cost per year: $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost per year = Total mileage cost + Total bonus cost
   - Total cost per year = $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800

Therefore, John pays a total of $31,800 a year for the driving service."
"To find out how many minutes Peter has to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

So, the total time exercised on Monday and Sunday combined is:
23 minutes + 16 minutes = 39 minutes.

Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined on Tuesday. Therefore, we need to multiply the total time by 2:

"To find out how much money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of books sold in the first year.
2. Determine the number of books sold in the second year.
3. Calculate the earnings for the second year.

First, we know that Elise currently has 50 unsold books and she has sold 45 books this year. This means she has sold a total of \(250 - 50 = 200\) books over the three years. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, and she sold 45 books this year, she sold \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books in the first year.

Now, we can find out how many books she sold in the second year. The total number of books sold over the three years is 200, and she sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books in the third year. Therefore, the number of books sold in the second year is \(200 - 90 - 45 = 65\).

Since each book sells for $20, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is \(65 \times 20 = 1300\).

The total amount of money she earned in the second year is $1300."
"Watson works 10 hours each day for 5 days a week, so he works 50 hours a week. He earns $10 per hour, so his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:

\[ 50 \text{ hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$500 \text{ per week} \]

Since the company performed well for the whole month of April, Watson also gets a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total weekly earnings including the bonus are:

\[ \$500 + \$300 = \$800 \text{ per week} \]

April typically has 4 weeks, so Watson's total earnings for the month are:

\[ \$800 \text{ per week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$3200 \]

Therefore, Watson made \(\boxed{3200}\) dollars in April."

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, the cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
\[ 5 \times \$100 + \$700 = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

The total amount Theo wants to save is $2000. Therefore, the total amount he can spend on the trip is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

Now, let's sum up the costs of the suits, suitcases, and flight ticket:
\[ \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$2050 \]

The amount left for buying gifts is:

3. Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.
4. Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age, which means the population was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

Now, we need to find the current population of Chile. The problem states that the population six years ago was half of what it is now. Therefore, the current population is twice the population six years ago.

So, the current population of Chile is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

Final numerical answer:
120000"
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem, there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).

Additionally, there are half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{1}{2}D \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3.5D = 105 \]

To find \( D \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3.5:

\[ D = \frac{105}{3.5} = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

Total invited: \(12 + 12 = 24\) people

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness

Now, we calculate the number of people who had previous commitments:

- 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) people

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is:

- 8 (due to illness) + 2 (previous commitments) = 10 people

Finally, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited to find out how many people show up:

- Total invited: 24
- People who couldn't come: 10

People who show up: \(24 - 10 = 14\)

"First, let's calculate the number of marbles Solomon received from his father. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, and his father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \) times as many marbles as he bought. So, the number of marbles his father gave him is:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

Now, let's find the total number of marbles Solomon has. He initially had 50 marbles in the store, bought 20 more from Johanna, and received 8 more from his father. Therefore, the total number of marbles is:

\[ 50 + 20 + 8 = 78 \]

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of the marbles is:

\[ 78 \times 2 = 156 \]

The total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 156kgs."
"To calculate the cost to fill the pool, we first need to determine the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep, so the volume \( V \) is calculated as:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \times 5 \, \text{ft} \]
\[ V = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

The cost to fill the pool is $.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = V \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{\$/cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 12 \, \text{\$} \]

The cost to fill the pool is $12."
"Given that the classroom has 30 boys, we can use the information provided to find the number of girls and nongendered children.

1. The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys:
   \[ \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

2. The number of nongendered children is 1/10 the number of boys:
   \[ \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \]

To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
\[ \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

Total number of children: 123"
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

1. Let the number of electric poles be \( P \) and the number of electric wires be \( W \).
2. According to the ratio, \( P:W = 1:3 \).
3. This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.
4. Given \( W = 45 \), we can set up the proportion: \( \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \).
5. Substituting \( W = 45 \) into the proportion, we get \( \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \).
6. Solving for \( P \), we multiply both sides by 45: \( P = \frac{45}{3} \).
7. Therefore, \( P = 15 \).

The total number of electric poles required is 15."
"At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, 1/4 of 40 people is 10 people.

This means that 30 people stayed at the party (40 - 10 = 30).

We are told that 22 men stayed at the party. Since the total number of people who stayed is 30, the number of women who stayed can be calculated as follows:

30 (total people who stayed) - 22 (men who stayed) = 8 women who stayed.

So, the number of women left at the party is 8."
"The magazine costs half as much as a book, and the book costs $4. So, the magazine costs:

\[ 2 - 1 = \$1 \]

The pen costs $1."
"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. According to the problem, Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together give a total of 26 pencils. 

We can set up the equation for Jam's pencils as follows:
\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + \text{Loose pencils} = \text{Total pencils} \]
\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + 2 = 26 \]

To find the number of pencils in the boxes, we subtract 2 from 26:
\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} = 26 - 2 = 24 \]

Now, we know that Jam has 24 pencils in boxes and 2 loose pencils, making a total of 26 pencils.

Next, we consider Meg's pencils. The problem states that Meg has 46 pencils.

To find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils, we first need to determine the total number of pencils they have together:
\[ \text{Total pencils} = \text{Jam's pencils} + \text{Meg's pencils} \]
\[ \text{Total pencils} = 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Assuming each box can hold the same number of pencils as the boxes Jam has (which hold 24 pencils each), we need to determine how many boxes are required to store 72 pencils. We divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:
\[ \text{Number of boxes needed} = \frac{\text{Total pencils}}{\text{Pencils per box}} \]
\[ \text{Number of boxes needed} = \frac{72}{24} = 3 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 3 boxes to store all their pencils.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to calculate the total weakening effect from the ice cubes and the cream added.

First, let's calculate the weakening effect from the ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Shannon's coffee is cooled by 65 degrees. To find out how many ice cubes are used, we divide the total cooling by the cooling effect of one ice cube:

\[ \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, the total weakening effect from the ice cubes is:

\[ \text{Weakening from ice cubes} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters} \]

Next, we need to account for the weakening effect from the cream. Adding 15 milliliters of cream weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

So, the total weakening effect is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:

\[ \text{Total weakening} = 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio and apply it to the number of new records the people received.

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means for every new record received, 2 old records are given up.

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records given up as follows:

\[ \text{Total old records} = 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior programmers. Given that the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, and the total number of employees is 100, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total monthly payment to junior programmers is:

\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so their monthly payment is:

\[ \text{Monthly payment to senior programmers} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

The total monthly payment to senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:

\[ \text{Total payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:

\[ \boxed{224000} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal be \( x \).

2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).

3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

4. Simplifying the expression, we get \( x + 6 \).

5. We know that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, \( x + 6 = 20 \).

6. Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 20 - 6 = 14 \).

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

3. He passes 14 out to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\).
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends: \(14 \times 2 = 28\). So, he now has \(8 + 28 = 36\).
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\).
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\).

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31."
"To fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, it needs an additional 40 percentage points of charge. Given that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to recharge the remaining 40 percentage points as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes per percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."

She has 14 lollipops left."
"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

\[ \text{Rewards earned} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

On this shopping trip, the customer spent $43 and used their $4 reward. However, they also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the coupon took \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars off the price.

The total discount from the rewards and the coupon is:

\[ 4 + 8 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting this discount from the $43 spent:

\[ 43 - 12 = 31 \text{ dollars} \]

"To determine which job has a higher net pay and by how much, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per year: 2000
- Total annual pay before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Tax rate: 20%
- Tax amount: $30,000 * 20% = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual pay before tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate: 10%
- Tax amount: $36,000 * 10% = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate, which is Job B."

1. Calculate the total number of ruined castles.
2. Determine how many of these ruined castles are unmanned.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of ruined castles.
40 percent of the 220 castles are ruins. So, we calculate 40% of 220:
\[ 0.40 \times 220 = 88 \]
So, there are 88 ruined castles.

Step 2: Determine how many of these ruined castles are unmanned.
Half of the ruined castles are unmanned. So, we calculate half of 88:

"First, let's calculate the value of the shares after the first year. Maria initially buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the initial total value is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price per share after the increase, we calculate:

\[ \$8 \times 1.50 = \$12 \]

So, the value of the 8 shares after the first year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To find the new price per share after the decrease, we calculate:

\[ \$12 \times 0.75 = \$9 \]

So, the value of the 8 shares after the second year is:

John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke."
"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group will then have \( x - 10 \) students.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can write the equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation, we get:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The smallest group, therefore, has:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

The number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"To solve this problem, let's start by setting up some equations based on the information given.

Let \( C \) represent the number of cows and \( H \) represent the number of chickens. According to the problem, Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so we can write:
\[ H = 2C \]

We also know that the total number of animals is 60, so:
\[ C + H = 60 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know there are 20 cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times C) + (2 \times H) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times 20) + (2 \times 40) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

So, the animals on Farmer Brown's farm have a total of 160 legs."

4 - 2 = 2 balls

Therefore, Josh starts to juggle with 2 balls.

2 balls"
"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself.

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

The total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, plus the container itself, is 260 pounds."

1. Calculate the additional distance Tyson should run each day according to his coach's advice.
2. Determine the total distance Tyson runs each day after following the coach's advice.
3. Calculate the total distance Tyson runs in June, assuming June has 30 days.

Step 1: Calculate the additional distance Tyson should run each day.
Tyson's original daily distance is 5000 meters. The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters. So, we calculate 1/5 of 5000 meters:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

Step 2: Determine the total distance Tyson runs each day after following the coach's advice.
\[ 5000 \text{ meters} + 1000 \text{ meters} = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total distance Tyson runs in June.
June has 30 days, so we multiply the daily distance by 30:
\[ 6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June is 180000 meters."

"To find out how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts after a 40% discount, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount.
2. Calculate the discount amount.
3. Subtract the discount amount from the total cost to find the final amount paid.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost without the discount.
Each shirt costs $30, and Davos bought 2 shirts.
Total cost without discount = $30 * 2 = $60

Step 2: Calculate the discount amount.
The discount is 40%, so we calculate 40% of $60.
Discount amount = 40% of $60 = 0.40 * $60 = $24

Step 3: Subtract the discount amount from the total cost.
Final amount paid = Total cost without discount - Discount amount
Final amount paid = $60 - $24 = $36

Therefore, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts."

   - There are 12 months in a year, so the yearly cost for food is \(100 \times 12 = 1200\) dollars.

2. **Treats Cost:**
   - Treats cost $20 per month.
   - The yearly cost for treats is \(20 \times 12 = 240\) dollars.

3. **Medicine Cost:**
   - Medicine costs $100 per month.
   - The yearly cost for medicine is \(100 \times 12 = 1200\) dollars.

Now, we sum up all the yearly costs:
- Yearly cost for food: $1200
- Yearly cost for treats: $240
- Yearly cost for medicine: $1200

Total yearly cost = \(1200 + 240 + 1200 = 2640\) dollars.

Therefore, Madeline spends \(\boxed{2640}\) dollars on her dog per year."
"To find the total number of hours Peyton's after-work activities will take, we need to calculate the duration of each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Monday's Yoga Class**: 1 hour
2. **Tuesday's Cooking Class**: 3 times as long as Monday's yoga class, so \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours
3. **Wednesday's Cheese-Tasting Event**: 0.5 hours (or 30 minutes)
4. **Thursday's Museum Tour**: Half as long as the cooking class, so \(3 \div 2 = 1.5\) hours
5. **Friday's Errands**: 2 hours

Now, we sum up all the hours:

\[1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 8\]

Therefore, all of Peyton's after-work activities will take a total of 8 hours."
"April is donating plant pots for the school's garden. The school asked for 30 plant pots for the daisies and twice as many for the roses. 

First, we calculate the number of plant pots needed for the roses:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we add the number of plant pots needed for the daisies and the roses to find the total number of plant pots required:
\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \]

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number of plant pots she bought:
\[ 100 - 90 = 10 \]

Therefore, April has 10 plant pots left over."
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent and gave away from the total amount she had initially.

1. Andrea had $36 initially.
2. She spent $11 on a sweater.
3. She gave her brother $4.

So, the total amount spent and given away is $11 + $4 = $15.

Now, subtract this total from the initial amount:

$36 - $15 = $21

Andrea saved $21."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming. He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Next, he watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is:

\[ 3 \times 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let's denote the total time spent on vacation as \( T \). Therefore, we have:

\[ 0.30T = 15 \text{ hours} \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ hours}}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. So, the time spent sightseeing is:

\[ 0.40 \times 50 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time John spent sightseeing is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Annabelle earns from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works 20 hours, so:

\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much money she earns from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works 15 hours, so:

\[ 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, let's add the money she already has in her savings, the money from her first job, and the money from her second job:

\[ 80 \, \text{dollars} + 200 \, \text{dollars} + 75 \, \text{dollars} = 355 \, \text{dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so the amount of money Annabelle still needs to save is:

\[ 400 \, \text{dollars} - 355 \, \text{dollars} = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save \(\boxed{45}\) dollars."
"The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet.

The second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so its height is:
6 feet + 5 feet = 11 feet

The combined height of the shortest and second trees is:
6 feet + 11 feet = 17 feet

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two trees, so:
2 * 17 feet = 34 feet

The height of the tallest tree is 34 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dean bought:

- The cost of 6 toy cars at $2 each is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) dollars.
- The cost of 5 teddy bears at $1 each is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total cost of the items is \(12 + 5 = 17\) dollars.

Dean started with $28. After buying the items, he has \(28 - 17 = 11\) dollars left.

Then, his mother gives him an extra $10, so he now has \(11 + 10 = 21\) dollars.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost for Morgan and her friends to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. Then, we'll subtract this total from her budget to see how much money is left for her friends.

1. **Cost of mini-golf for one person**: $5
2. **Cost of go-karts for one person (2 rides)**: $10 * 2 = $20
3. **Total cost for one person (mini-golf + go-karts)**: $5 + $20 = $25
4. **Total cost for one person (mini-golf + go-karts + $5 in arcade tokens)**: $25 + $5 = $30

Now, we subtract the cost for Morgan from her total budget to find out how much money is left for her friends.

5. **Morgan's budget**: $90
6. **Cost for Morgan**: $30
7. **Money left for friends**: $90 - $30 = $60

Each friend will also need to cover the cost of $30 (mini-golf + go-karts + $5 in arcade tokens).

8. **Number of friends Morgan can invite**: $60 / $30 = 2

Therefore, Morgan can invite 2 friends to her birthday party."
"Marisa gets $5 every day as pocket money. She spends 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so the total cost of the lollipops is:

4 lollipops * $0.25 per lollipop = $1.00

The amount she saves each day is the difference between her pocket money and the cost of the lollipops:

$5.00 - $1.00 = $4.00

If she saves for 5 days, the total amount she saves is:

$4.00 per day * 5 days = $20.00

Therefore, Marisa puts $20.00 in her piggy bank if she saves for 5 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount Billy spent on gumballs:**
   - Billy bought 40 gumballs.
   - Each gumball costs $0.05.
   - Total cost for gumballs = 40 * $0.05 = $2.

2. **Calculate the total amount of money Billy had before buying gumballs:**
   - Since he spent $2 on gumballs, and this was half of his change, the total change he had before buying gumballs is $2 * 2 = $4.
   - Billy started with $10, so the amount he spent on candy is $10 - $4 = $6.

3. **Calculate the amount of candy Billy bought:**
   - The candy costs $1.5 per pound.
   - Amount of candy bought = $6 / $1.5 per pound = 4 pounds.

Therefore, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy."
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( S \).

According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. Carver is 45 years old, so we can write the equation as:

\[ 45 = 2S - 5 \]

To find \( S \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 45 + 5 = 2S \]
\[ 50 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ S = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs, which is \(75 + 100 = 175\) miles. So, the distance from the third city to the first city is \(175 - 50 = 125\) miles.

Now, let's add up the distances for one complete trip:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily travel distance:
\[\frac{18000}{900} = 20\]

So, the train goes 20 days between services.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed:**
   - A bed for a Rottweiler takes 8 pounds of stuffing.
   - A bed for a chihuahua takes 2 pounds of stuffing.
   - A bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed.
   - The average is calculated as \((8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5\) pounds of stuffing.

2. **Calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:**
   - Each chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing.
   - For 4 chihuahua beds, the total is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) pounds of stuffing.

3. **Calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:**
   - Each collie bed requires 5 pounds of stuffing.
   - For 3 collie beds, the total is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) pounds of stuffing.

4. **Add the amounts together to find the total amount of stuffing needed:**
   - Total stuffing for chihuahua beds: 8 pounds
   - Total stuffing for collie beds: 15 pounds
   - Combined total: \(8 + 15 = 23\) pounds of stuffing.

Therefore, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds."
"To calculate the total time John spent on his trip, we need to calculate the time for each leg of the journey and then sum them up.

1. **First Leg:**
   - Distance: 220 miles (200 miles to the friend's house + 10 miles detour)
   - Speed: 70 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 220 miles / 70 mph = 3.142857 hours

2. **Second Leg:**
   - Distance: 240 miles
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Now, we add the times for both legs of the trip:
- Total time = 3.142857 hours + 3 hours = 6.142857 hours

Rounding to two decimal places, the total time is approximately 6.14 hours.

**Final numerical answer:**

"To find out how many fourth-grade boys were at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of fourth-grade boys at the school.
2. Subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

First, we know there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is:
\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

On Friday, 4 fourth-grade boys were absent. Therefore, the number of boys present on Friday is:
\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

So, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is:
\[ \boxed{49} \]"
"There are 6 girls in the park. If there are twice the number of boys, then there are 6 * 2 = 12 boys in the park.

"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass, we need to calculate the total points she has already scored and then find out how many more points she needs to reach the minimum requirement of 42 points.

1. Jane's score on the first test: 15 points
2. Jane's score on the second test: 18 points

Total points from the first two tests:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

To find out the minimum score needed on the third test, we subtract the total points she has already scored from the required total of 42 points:
\[ 42 - 33 = 9 \]

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on her third test to pass.

The minimum number of points she must score on the third test to pass is 9."
"First, let's determine the number of people kicked out for shoplifting. We know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks. The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times that number minus 5. So, we calculate:

\[ 4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

Next, we calculate the number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. This number is three times the number of shoplifters:

\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we know the total number of people kicked out for the three specific reasons (refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence over goods on sale) is:

\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

Given that the total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is 50, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:

\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:

\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that after scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times more points than Sara.
2. Sara scored 8 points, so three times Sara's points would be \(3 \times 8 = 24\) points.
3. This means that after scoring 14 points, Erin has 24 points.
4. To find out how many points Erin had before scoring those 14 points, we subtract 14 from 24.

So, \(24 - 14 = 10\).

Therefore, Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points.

"To calculate the total cost for the senior gifts, we need to break down the expenses into several parts:

1. **Cost of picture frames for all seniors:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - There are 44 seniors.
   - Total cost for picture frames = 44 * $20 = $880.

2. **Cost of etching the logo on each picture frame:**
   - The etching cost is 20% of the picture frame cost.
   - 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4.
   - Total etching cost for 44 seniors = 44 * $4 = $176.

3. **Cost of pins for 2 seniors:**
   - Each pin costs $5.
   - Total cost for pins = 2 * $5 = $10.

4. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers.
   - Number of officers = 44 * 1/4 = 11.
   - Each cord costs $12.
   - Total cost for cords = 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we add all these costs together to find the total amount spent:

- Total cost for picture frames = $880
- Total etching cost = $176
- Total cost for pins = $10
- Total cost for cords = $132

Total amount spent = $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1208

**The total amount spent on the senior gifts is $1208.**"
"To find out how much Ethan would save by making his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate 20% of the market price and then subtract that from the original price.

The market price of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400.

20% of $400 is calculated as:
\[ 400 \times \frac{20}{100} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

So, Ethan would save $80 by making his own wallpaper.

To find the total cost of making his own wallpaper, we subtract the savings from the original price:
\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday, which is:
\[ 14 \times 2 = 28 \text{ pairs} \]

On the last day of the sale, they sold one-half the amount that they did on Saturday, which is:
\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ pairs} \]

However, six pairs were returned because they didn't fit, so the actual number of pairs sold on the last day is:
\[ 14 - 6 = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

To find the total number of pairs sold during the sale, we add the pairs sold on each day:
\[ 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \text{ pairs} \]

Therefore, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is:
50 pairs."

"To find out how many pupils like the color yellow, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pupils who like blue.
2. Determine the number of pupils remaining after those who like blue are accounted for.
3. Calculate the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils.
4. Subtract the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils to find out how many like yellow.

Let's start with step 1:
- Half of the class likes blue, so we calculate \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) pupils like blue.

Next, step 2:
- After accounting for the 20 pupils who like blue, we have \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) pupils remaining.

For step 3:
- One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so we calculate \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) pupils like green.

Finally, step 4:
- The rest of the pupils like yellow, so we subtract the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils: \( 20 - 5 = 15 \) pupils like yellow.

Therefore, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is 15."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of apples sold on Monday:**
   - Lucy got $56 from selling the apples on Monday.

Therefore, Rachel has 21 cookies left."
"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including the interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the interest for the five months. The interest rate is 10% per year, so for five months, the interest rate is:

\[ \text{Interest rate for 5 months} = \frac{10\% \times 5}{12} = \frac{10}{12}\% = \frac{10}{1200} = \frac{1}{120} \]

Now, we calculate the interest on the principal amount of $3,650:

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times \frac{1}{120} = 30.4167 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 30.4167 = 3680.4167 \]

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3680.4167}{5} = 736.08334 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:

\[ \boxed{736.08} \]"
"To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Cho hiked = 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 km

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Chloe hiked = 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 km

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
Difference = Distance Cho hiked - Distance Chloe hiked
Difference = 112 km - 45 km = 67 km

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos.

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, which means she has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, which means she has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos they have together:

- Total silver pesos: \(50 + 100 = 150\)
- Total gold pesos: \(80 + 120 = 200\)

The total number of pesos they have together is \(150 + 200 = 350\).

"First, let's determine the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She has 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, the total number of cups of lemonade is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to subtract the cost of the supplies from the total revenue to find the profit. The cost of the supplies is $18, so the profit is:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she sells all 36 cups, the time it takes to sell all the lemonade is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

Therefore, the profit Millie makes per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:

\[ \$2 \]"
"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he kept \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land. We know that the amount of land he kept is 12.8 hectares.

So, we can write the equation as:
\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]
\[ x = 32 \]

Therefore, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.50 * 52 = 26

The performance is done by the female members, so initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform. However, on the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

Number of girls who can't make it = 0.50 * 26 = 13

So, the number of girls who actually perform is:

Number of girls who perform = 26 - 13 = 13

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Total number of people who sang = Number of girls who perform + Number of teachers = 13 + 3 = 16

Therefore, the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is $36."
"James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson.

To find out how many messages he delivers to Mr. Yu, we calculate 1/3 of 66:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

So, James delivers 22 messages to Mr. Yu.

To find the total number of messages delivered, we add the messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu:
\[ 66 + 22 = 88 \]

Therefore, the total number of messages James delivers is 88."
"To determine how much money David saves, let's break down the costs for both David and Dasha.

First, let's calculate the cost for Dasha:
- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, each ride costs \(2 \times 2 = $4\).
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \times 4 = $36\).

Now, let's calculate the cost for David:
- David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.
- Therefore, the total cost for David is $30.

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract the cost for David from the cost for Dasha:
- The savings for David is \(36 - 30 = $6\).

So, David saves $6."
"First, let's calculate the total number of gifts Monica needs to wrap:

- Gifts for her family: 6
- Gifts for her friends: 4
- Gifts for her teachers: 2

Total number of gifts = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to make bows for all 12 gifts. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of gifts:

144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given ratio and the total number of popsicles to find out how many popsicles each person has.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of popsicles is the sum of Betty's and Sam's popsicles:
\[5x + 6x = 165\]
\[11x = 165\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 11:
\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles.
- Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[90 - 75 = 15\]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services without the bundle discount:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu costs $10 a month.
- Disney Plus costs $10 a month.

So, the total cost without the bundle discount is:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services with the 20% bundle discount:

- The total cost before the discount is $30.
- The discount is 20%, so the amount saved is:
\[ 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost with the bundle discount is:
\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the cable package:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Finally, let's calculate the total savings by comparing the cost of the cable package to the cost of the streaming services with the bundle discount:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars per month} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time Carol spent on her work.

Carol spends 4 hours writing a song. Since she spends half that much time recording it, she spends \(4 \div 2 = 2\) hours recording. 

The time spent editing is given as 90 minutes. We need to convert this to hours to make the units consistent. Since 60 minutes make an hour, 90 minutes is \(90 \div 60 = 1.5\) hours.

Now, let's add up all the time spent:
- Writing: 4 hours
- Recording: 2 hours
- Editing: 1.5 hours

Total time spent = \(4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5\) hours.

Next, we calculate the percentage of the total time spent editing. The time spent editing is 1.5 hours, and the total time is 7.5 hours. The percentage is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100 = 20\%
\]

So, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing."

"First, let's calculate the total number of Valentine's cards Erica initially had:

- Erica made 20 cards.
- Her dad brought 2 boxes with 15 cards each, so that's \(2 \times 15 = 30\) cards.

Adding these together, Erica initially had \(20 + 30 = 50\) cards.

Next, let's account for the cards she passed out and received:

- She passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
- She passed out 5 cards to her family.
- She received 17 cards from family and friends.

So, the total number of cards she gave away is \(24 + 5 = 29\).

The net change in the number of cards she has is the number she received minus the number she gave away, which is \(17 - 29 = -12\).

Therefore, the final number of Valentine's cards Erica has is \(50 - 29 - 12 = 9\).

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, Bill gets:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Next, Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. So, Mark gets:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices herself. So, the total number of slices given away or eaten is:
\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \text{ slices} \]

Finally, to find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices given away or eaten from the original number of slices:
\[ 12 - 9 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the number of slices left is:

"First, let's calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when it is used for 8 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. Therefore, for 8 hours, the energy consumption is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the energy consumption to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Now, if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, the air conditioner will be used for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

The energy consumption for 3 hours is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Therefore, the total kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:
\[ 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]"
"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

1. Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each:
   - Total stripes for these two zebras: \(2 \times 17 = 34\)

2. She also counts a zebra with 36 stripes:
   - Total stripes for this zebra: \(36\)

3. Another zebra has half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes:
   - Half of 36 is \(36 / 2 = 18\)
   - Total stripes for this zebra: \(18\)

Now, we add up all the stripes:
- Total stripes: \(34 + 36 + 18 = 88\)

Next, we count the number of zebras:
- Total number of zebras: \(2 + 1 + 1 = 4\)

To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
- Average number of stripes: \(88 / 4 = 22\)

Therefore, the average number of stripes on the zebras is 22."
"To determine how much money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sandwiches needed to serve 20 people.
2. Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.
3. Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of sandwiches needed.**
Each sandwich serves 4 people. Therefore, the number of sandwiches needed for 20 people is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.**
Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of meat and cheese needed is:
\[ 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of meat per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \]
\[ 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of cheese per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese.**
The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound, and the cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound. Therefore, the total cost for the meat and cheese is:
\[ 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \times \$7.00 \text{ per pound} = \$35.00 \]
\[ 5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \times \$3.00 \text{ per pound} = \$15.00 \]

"Given that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis, and he has 40 cannolis, we can calculate the number of corns as follows:

Number of corns = 2 * Number of cannolis
Number of corns = 2 * 40
Number of corns = 80

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he already had. So, the new number of cannolis and corns are:

New number of cannolis = 40 (original) + 60 (bought)
New number of cannolis = 100

New number of corns = 80 (original) - 40 (fewer)
New number of corns = 40

Now, to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house:

Total = New number of cannolis + New number of corns
Total = 100 + 40
Total = 140

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 140."
"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of steps Elliott needs to take in a day: 10,000 steps.
2. Calculate the number of steps he has already taken before his jog:
   - He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is \( \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \) steps.
   - He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
   - So, the total steps before the jog are \( 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \) steps.
3. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. This means he had already taken \( 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 \) steps in total.
4. The number of steps he took during his jog is the difference between the total steps he had taken before and after the jog: \( 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 \) steps.

Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total payment for May.
2. Determine the number of employees remaining after June.
3. Calculate the total payment for June.
4. Sum the payments from May and June.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**

- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment for May = Number of employees × Hourly wage × Hours worked per week
Total payment for May = 40 × $15 × 40
Total payment for May = $24,000

**Step 2: Determine the number of employees remaining after June.**

- 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired in June.
- Number of employees who left = 1/4 × 40 = 10
- Number of employees remaining = 40 - 10 = 30

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for June.**

- Number of employees in June: 30
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment for June = Number of employees × Hourly wage × Hours worked per week
Total payment for June = 30 × $15 × 40
Total payment for June = $18,000

**Step 4: Sum the payments from May and June.**

Total payment for May and June = Total payment for May + Total payment for June
Total payment for May and June = $24,000 + $18,000
Total payment for May and June = $42,000

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $42,000."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. This means that for 2 pounds of taffy, Sally pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (since it's half off).

The cost of the taffy is:
\[ \$3 + \$1.50 = \$4.50 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost $0.25 each. Since she bought 4 magnets, the total cost for the magnets is:
\[ 4 \times \$0.25 = \$1.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the seashells and the magnets to the cost of the taffy:
\[ \$4.50 + \$1.50 + \$1.00 = \$7.00 \]

Sally started with $10. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from the amount she started with:
\[ \$10.00 - \$7.00 = \$3.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$3.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the second pack of fireworks. Since it's worth twice the amount of the first pack, we have:

\[ 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

Next, we add the cost of the first pack and the second pack to find the total cost before the discount:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Now, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the fireworks. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the original cost:

\[ 1200 \times 0.80 = 960 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

So, the total amount Tim spent is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the problem does not provide a direct percentage for candles that explode. Instead, it gives us a guarantee that the candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which implies that 1% of the candles might explode.

Given:
- Total candles made = 50,000
- Percentage of candles that might explode = 1%
- Percentage of candles that smell like wet dog = 5%
- We need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode.

First, calculate the number of candles that might explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles that might explode} = 1\% \times 50,000 = 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500 \]

Since the problem does not provide a specific percentage of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we can assume that the defect that makes the candles smell like wet dog is independent of the defect that makes them explode. Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode would be the product of the percentage of candles that smell like wet dog and the percentage of candles that might explode.

\[ \text{Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode} = 5\% \times 500 = 0.05 \times 500 = 25 \]

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount price of one blouse.
2. Multiply the discount price by the number of blouses Misha picked.

First, let's calculate the discount price of one blouse. The original price of each blouse is $20, and they are on a 30% off rack. So, the discount amount per blouse is:

\[ 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

This means each blouse is discounted by $6. Therefore, the price of one discounted blouse is:

\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Now, Misha picks out 4 blouses. So, the total cost for 4 blouses is:

\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples.
3. Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees, but we don't know the exact number yet. Let's call this number \(x\).

Joanne's total apples = \(30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\).

Joanne's sister gathers:
- Twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
- Three times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
- No apples from the average trees.

Joanne's sister's total apples = \(60 + 45 = 105\).

The combined total of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500 apples. So, we can set up the equation:

\[45 + x + 105 = 500\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[150 + x = 500\]

Subtract 150 from both sides to solve for \(x\):

\[x = 500 - 150\]
\[x = 350\]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

**Final numerical answer: 350**"
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of heads is 180, which means \( C + D = 180 \).
2. The total number of humps is 304, which means \( 2C + D = 304 \) (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump).

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can express \( D \) from the first equation:
\[ D = 180 - C \]

Next, we substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[ 2C + (180 - C) = 304 \]
\[ 2C + 180 - C = 304 \]
\[ C + 180 = 304 \]
\[ C = 304 - 180 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we have \( C = 124 \), we can find \( D \):
\[ D = 180 - C \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days:
- He traveled 200 kilometers each day for 4 days.
- Total distance in the first 4 days = 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km.

Next, we calculate the distance he traveled over the next two days, which was 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days:
- 30% of 800 km = 0.30 * 800 km = 240 km.

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is 0 km.

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days:
- Total distance in the second week = 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km.

Now, we add up all the distances to find the total distance traveled during the two-week trip:
- Total distance = 800 km (first 4 days) + 240 km (next 2 days) + 0 km (rest day) + 2100 km (second week) = 3140 km.

Therefore, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is 3140 kilometers."
"Given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4.

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.

\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"Stanley's comb fell from an elevation of 10,000 feet to a ledge at 6,000 feet (10,000 feet - 4,000 feet). Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To reach the comb, Oliver must climb from 3,000 feet to 6,000 feet.

The number of feet Oliver must climb is:

6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet

Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To determine how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money given by the second bank.
2. Add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital.

The first bank gave Mr. Josue $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Now, we add the amounts from both banks to his initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has \(\boxed{17000}\) in capital."
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats carried away by the boats is:

4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats

After the boats carried away the cats, the number of cats left on the rock is:

50 cats - 20 cats = 30 cats

Then, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. So, the number of cats that ran after the mouse is:

(3/5) * 30 cats = 18 cats

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is:

30 cats - 18 cats = 12 cats

Final numerical answer:
12 cats"
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into the different pricing periods.

1. **First 6 months at $8 a month:**
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 a month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96
   \]

3. **The remaining 8 months (since 2 years is 24 months, and 6 + 8 = 14 months, so 24 - 14 = 10 months, but we only need 8 more to complete 2 years) at $14 a month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$112
   \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[
\$48 + \$96 + \$112 = \$256
\]

The total cost for 2 years of the service is:
\[
\$256

"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The problem states that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out the total savings Cole made. The problem states that he saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can set up the following equations:

Let \( S_{tattered} \) be the savings from the tattered jeans and \( S_{jogger} \) be the savings from the jogger jeans. We know:

\[ S_{tattered} + S_{jogger} = 6 \]
\[ S_{jogger} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
\[ S_{tattered} = 6 - 2 = 4 \]

The original price of the tattered jeans is $28, and Cole saved $4 on them, so the sale price of the tattered jeans is:

\[ 28 - 4 = 24 \]

The original price of the jogger jeans is $22, and Cole saved $2 on them, so the sale price of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 22 - 2 = 20 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:

\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles.

First, we calculate the capacity of the 4 buses:
4 buses * 60 employees per bus = 240 employees

Next, we calculate the capacity of the 6 minibusses:
6 minibusses * 30 employees per minibus = 180 employees

Then, we calculate the capacity of the 10 minivans:
10 minivans * 15 employees per minivan = 150 employees

Now, we add up all the capacities to get the total number of employees that can join the day trip:
240 employees (from buses) + 180 employees (from minibusses) + 150 employees (from minivans) = 570 employees

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others, making a total of 6 bird feeders.

The store-bought bird feeders attract 20 birds each. Since the feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, her homemade feeders attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of birds attracted by each type of feeder:

- For the 3 store-bought feeders: 3 feeders * 20 birds/feeder = 60 birds
- For the 3 homemade feeders: 3 feeders * 30 birds/feeder = 90 birds

Adding these together gives the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day:

60 birds + 90 birds = 150 birds

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day."
"To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the bagel is given as $4.
2. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. So, the cost of the soup is:
   \[
   4 + (0.25 \times 4) = 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The cake costs half the price of the bagel. So, the cost of the cake is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake:
\[
5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay \(\boxed{11}\) dollars for her dinner."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Kenny needs $100 to buy a ticket to the amusement park.
2. He plans to sell his Pokemon cards for $1.5 each.
3. He keeps 1/3 of the cards and has $50 in spending cash after selling the rest.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

- He keeps 1/3 of the cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards.
- The money he gets from selling \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \).

After selling the cards, he has $50 in spending cash and the cost of the ticket, which is $100, so the total money he has after selling the cards is $150.

Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation**: The caterer prepared enough hot dogs for half of the 36 guests to have two hot dogs each. So, half of 36 is 18 guests. This means 18 guests would get 2 hot dogs each, which totals 36 hot dogs for these guests.

2. **Total Hot Dogs Needed**: Since 40 guests showed up and everyone wanted a second hot dog, we need to calculate the total number of hot dogs required. Each of the 40 guests would need 2 hot dogs, so the total number of hot dogs needed is \(40 \times 2 = 80\) hot dogs.

3. **Hot Dogs Available**: The caterer initially prepared 36 hot dogs for the first 18 guests. Since 40 guests showed up, we need to find out how many more hot dogs are needed. The total number of hot dogs required is 80, and the caterer has already prepared 36, so the additional hot dogs needed are \(80 - 36 = 44\).

4. **Guests Without Second Hot Dog**: Since the caterer only has 44 more hot dogs to distribute and there are 40 guests wanting a second hot dog, all 40 guests can get a second hot dog. Therefore, no guests are left without a second hot dog.

Final numerical answer:
0 guests did not get a second hot dog."
"Indras' name has 6 letters.

Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3 letters.

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, so her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Therefore, the total number of letters in both names is 6 (Indras) + 7 (sister) = 13 letters.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Set of mixing bowls: $20.00
- 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Now, let's add these amounts together to get the total before the discount:

$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Next, we apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165.00, we calculate:

$165.00 * 0.80 = $132.00

So, the final amount of her order is:

$132.00"
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. Adding these together:

\[ 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 \]

So, the total cost of the items is $19.

Next, we need to determine how much money Dora currently has. She has saved $2 from her allowance and her mother gave her $16. Adding these amounts together:

\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]

So, Dora currently has $18.

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount of money she has from the total cost of the items:

\[ 19 - 18 = 1 \]

Therefore, Dora needs \(\boxed{1}\) more dollar to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, which is:

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, which is:
\[ 2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ dragons} \]

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \text{ dragons} \]

Prince Bruce has slain 30 dragons."
"First, we need to determine how much gasoline is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needs in gallons. Josey needs \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons by 8:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"First, let's calculate how much money George had left after his purchase. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Money left} = 5 \times \frac{1}{100} = 0.05 \]

So, George spent:

\[ 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the 3 bags of chips:

\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars:

\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we divide the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar to find out how many he bought:

\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, the number of lollipops he shared with his friends is:

20 ÷ 4 = 5 lollipops

Each of his friends received 5 lollipops."
"Rory's cake weighs 20 ounces in total. She cuts it into 8 pieces, so each piece weighs:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} \]

Rory and her mom each have one piece, so they have taken 2 pieces in total. The weight of the pieces they have is:

\[ 2 \times 2.5 \text{ ounces} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the remaining cake weighs:

\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have together:

Sitti has 34 oranges, and Juris has 22 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is:
\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Next, we need to determine how many people will be sharing these oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing the oranges with 6 other friends, so the total number of people sharing the oranges is:
\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

Now, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of people to find out how many oranges each person will get:
\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, each person will get 7 oranges. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine will use. He doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. So, he will use:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the cost for the onions will be:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is on sale for $2.00. So, the cost for the beef stock will be:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to find the total cost of the ingredients:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

"To find the perimeter of Billie's bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room in feet. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

We can rearrange this formula to solve for the width:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{Length}} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we first need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

For Elizabeth:
- Red beads: 1 pack * 20 beads/pack = 20 beads
- Clear beads: 2 packs * 20 beads/pack = 40 beads
- Total beads for Elizabeth: 20 + 40 = 60 beads

For Margareth:
- Blue beads: 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads
- Red beads: 4 packs * 20 beads/pack = 80 beads
- Total beads for Margareth: 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters:
- Margareth's beads - Elizabeth's beads = 140 - 60 = 80 beads

Therefore, one sister has 80 more beads than the other."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking**: Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour.
   - Temperature increase per hour = 5 degrees
   - Total time baking = 3 hours
   - Total temperature increase = 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees
   - New temperature after baking = 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

3. **Cooling**: Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   - Cooling rate = 2 degrees/10 minutes
   - Total time the window is open = 30 minutes
   - Total cooling = (2 degrees/10 minutes) * 30 minutes = 6 degrees
   - Final temperature = 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

The house's final temperature is 49 degrees."
"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon:

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time James took for the swim is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so:

\[ 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's:

\[ 170 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we can find out how long it took James to do the run by subtracting the time he took for the swim and the bike from his total time:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} - 85 \text{ minutes} = 59 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it took James 59 minutes to do the run."
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is:

\[ 1.25 \times 60 = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so:

\[ \text{Length of Movie B} = 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, so:

\[ \text{Length of Movie A} = \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Movie A was 20 minutes long."
"First, let's determine how far the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

Since 30 minutes is half an hour, we can calculate the distance as follows:
\[ \text{Distance} = 32 \, \text{MPH} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 16 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how much hay the horse eats. The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse will eat:
\[ \text{Hay consumed} = 16 \, \text{miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \, \text{bail/mile} = 8 \, \text{bails} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost for 8 bails is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \, \text{bails} \times 3 \, \text{\$/bail} = 24 \, \text{\$} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:
\[ \text{Total money} = 6 \times 5 = 30 \, \text{\$} \]

Finally, we calculate the change Michael will have after buying the hay:
\[ \text{Change} = 30 \, \text{\$} - 24 \, \text{\$} = 6 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, the change Michael has after he buys the hay is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has:

- She uses 4 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs.
- She also has 2 additional eggs.

So, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Since each glass requires 5 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 5:

\[
\frac{50}{5} = 10 \text{ glasses}
\]

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays she can put out:

\[
\frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ trays}

Therefore, Rozanne can put out 2 trays."
"To determine by how many points Joey is now winning, we need to calculate the total points for both Joey and Marcy after their respective turns and then find the difference between their scores.

First, let's calculate Joey's total points:
- Joey starts with 214 points.
- He scores an additional 26 points.
- Therefore, Joey's total points are \(214 + 26 = 240\).

Next, let's calculate Marcy's total points:
- Marcy starts with 225 points.
- She scores an additional 10 points.
- Therefore, Marcy's total points are \(225 + 10 = 235\).

Now, we find the difference between Joey's and Marcy's total points to determine by how many points Joey is winning:
- Joey's total points: 240
- Marcy's total points: 235
- The difference is \(240 - 235 = 5\).

So, Joey is now winning by \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"To calculate the salesman's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per sneaker.
2. Calculate the total revenue from the flash sale.
3. Calculate the total revenue from the department store.
4. Calculate the total revenue.
5. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost per sneaker.**

The total cost for the case of sneakers is $576, and there are 48 sneakers in the case. So, the cost per sneaker is:
\[ \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from the flash sale.**

The salesman sold 17 sneakers at $20 each. So, the revenue from the flash sale is:
\[ \text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from the department store.**

The salesman sold the remaining sneakers (48 - 17 = 31) at $25 each. So, the revenue from the department store is:
\[ \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total revenue.**

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the revenue from the department store:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 5: Calculate the profit.**

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ \text{Profit} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the salesman's profit is:
\[ \boxed{539} \]"

Therefore, the total number of crayons Beatrice bought is:
\[ 112 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Super Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $20
   - Popcorn with soda: $1 extra
   - Total cost with super ticket: $20 + $1 = $21

2. **Regular Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $12
   - Popcorn: Let's call the regular price of popcorn \( P \)
   - Soda: $3
   - Total cost without super ticket: $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \)

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - Therefore, the cost of the regular ticket option minus the cost of the super ticket option equals $2.
   - \( ($15 + P) - $21 = $2 \)

4. **Solve for \( P \):**

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the first day.
2. Calculate the new cost of filling one balloon after the price increase.
3. Calculate the total cost for filling 170 balloons at the new price.

**Step 1: Determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the first day.**

The total cost for 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon on the first day is:
\[ \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the new cost of filling one balloon after the price increase.**

The cost of each balloon increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is:
\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost for filling 170 balloons at the new price.**

The total cost for 170 balloons at the new price is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 170 \times 65 = 11050 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{11050} \]"
"To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

1. For the first part of the trip:
   - Speed = 60 mph
   - Time = 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles

2. For the second part of the trip:
   - Speed = 30 mph
   - Time = 1 hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 1 hour = 30 miles

3. Total distance traveled = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

4. Total time taken = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

5. Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."

"First, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed. The volume of a raised bed is given by its width, length, and height:

\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume of soil} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{\$/bag} = 1920 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, the potting soil will cost Bob $1920."
"First, let's determine the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = Number of red cards + 60% of the number of red cards
Number of green cards = 15 + 0.60 * 15
Number of green cards = 15 + 9
Number of green cards = 24

Next, we calculate the number of yellow cards. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the number of red and green cards:

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24
Number of yellow cards = 39

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards together:

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39
Total number of cards = 78

Therefore, the total number of cards of all mentioned colors is 78."
"Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. After twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn, which is:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

These 25 fairies joined the 50 fairies that were already there, so the total number of fairies became:

\[ 50 + 25 = 75 \]

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. So, the number of fairies remaining is:

\[ 75 - 30 = 45 \]

Therefore, the final number of fairies remaining is:

45"
"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, to find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.35 \times 100 = 35\% \]

Therefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots."
"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to make, we first need to calculate the total weight of all the feed he is buying.

1. **Hay**: 42 bales at 75 pounds each
   \[
   42 \times 75 = 3150 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Oats**: 20 sacks at 65 pounds each
   \[
   20 \times 65 = 1300 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Carrots**: 4 bags at 12 pounds each
   \[
   4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Sugar cubes**: 2 boxes at 1 pound each
   \[
   2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Now, we add up all the weights to find the total weight of the feed:
\[
3150 + 1300 + 48 + 2 = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:
\[
\frac{4500}{2250} = 2
\]

Therefore, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."

For the aluminum cans:
3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week

For the plastic bottles:
5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week

Total earnings per week:
6 cents (from cans) + 15 cents (from bottles) = 21 cents/week

For a four-week month:
21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents

Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month."
"First, let's determine how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

\[ \text{Toni's plants} = \text{Frederick's plants} + 0.60 \times \text{Frederick's plants} \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 0.60 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 16 \]

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate the number of plants Shondra has as follows:

\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = \text{Toni's plants} - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 16 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 9 \]

Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants."

"To find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we first need to calculate the tip amount, which is 1/5 of the pizza order cost.

The cost of the pizza is $15.

The tip amount is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 15 = 3 \) dollars.

Now, we add the tip to the cost of the pizza to get the total amount:

Total amount = Cost of pizza + Tip
Total amount = $15 + $3
Total amount = $18

Therefore, the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man is $18."
"Let's break down Finley's position changes step by step:

1. She started in first place.
2. She fell back 5 spots: \(1 - 5 = -4\). Since she can't be in a negative spot, we adjust this to the last possible positive spot, which is 4th place (assuming a standard race format where the first place is the best).
3. She then moved ahead 2 spots: \(4 + 2 = 6\). So, she is now in 6th place.
4. She fell behind 3 spots: \(6 - 3 = 3\). So, she is now in 3rd place.
5. Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot: \(3 + 1 = 4\). So, she is now in 4th place.

Therefore, Finley finished in 4th place."

"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we need to calculate the number of each type of laundry item per room and then multiply by the number of rooms.

1. Each room has 2 sheets.
2. Each room has 1 comforter.
3. Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases.
4. Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 towels.

Now, let's sum up the total number of laundry items per room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforters: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

Total laundry items per room = 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15

"First, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet to match the unit of the shark's body length. There are 12 inches in a foot.

Each remora is 6 inches long, which is \( \frac{6}{12} = 0.5 \) feet long.

Since there are 2 remoras, the combined length of the remoras is \( 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \) foot.

The shark's body length is 10 feet.

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

"To find out how many kids in Gina's class are not allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to first determine how many kids are allergic to at least one of the substances (dairy or peanuts).

Let's denote:
- \( D \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( P \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

We are given:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

The number of kids allergic to at least one of the substances is given by:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

This means 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances. Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:

"To calculate the total cost of the trip, we need to consider the cost of the plane tickets and the cost of the hotel stay.

1. **Plane Tickets:**
   - Each plane ticket costs $5000.
   - Since there are two tickets, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
     \[
     5000 \times 2 = 10000
     \]

2. **Hotel Cost:**
   - The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day.
   - The hotel is 20% more expensive because it is a busy weekend.
   - The increased price per day is:
     \[

     \]
   - Therefore, the cost per day during the busy weekend is:
     \[
     1500 + 300 = 1800
     \]
   - They are staying for 3 days, so the total hotel cost is:
     \[
     1800 \times 3 = 5400
     \]

3. **Total Cost of the Trip:**
   - Adding the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel stay:

Next, since he runs at a pace of 10 miles per hour, we can find out how many hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles by his speed:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, James runs a total of 6 hours a week."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the daily consumption of oats for one horse:**
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, the daily consumption for one horse is \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).

2. **Determine the daily consumption of oats for all four horses:**
   - Since there are four horses, the total daily consumption is \(10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).

3. **Determine the total consumption of oats for five days:**
   - The total consumption for five days is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).

4. **Determine the number of bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.

2. Divide the sum by the number of countries (which is 3).

The highest temperatures are:
- Southlandia: -48°F
- Northlandia: 21°F
- Midlandia: -3°F

Now, let's add these temperatures together:

-48 + 21 + (-3) = -30°F

Next, we divide the sum by 3:

-30 / 3 = -10°F

Therefore, the average highest temperature of these three countries is -10°F."
"To find out how many days it will take the child to save the remaining amount of money, we first need to calculate the remaining amount he needs to save.

The toy car costs $12, and the child already has $4 saved. So, the remaining amount he needs to save is:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

The child promises to save $2 daily from his allowance. To find out how many days it will take to save the remaining $8, we divide the remaining amount by the daily savings:

\[ 8 \div 2 = 4 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each tray can hold 24 eggs.
2. Jaime has 2 trays, so the total capacity of the trays is \(24 \times 2 = 48\) eggs.
3. Jaime has 64 eggs in total.

Now, we need to find out how many eggs won't be able to be placed on the tray. We do this by subtracting the total capacity of the trays from the total number of eggs:

\[64 - 48 = 16\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

16 eggs won't be able to be placed on the tray."
"To find out how much Sally spends in all, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza and then add it to the cost of the small pizza.

1. The cost of the small pizza is $8.
2. The family-size pizza costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, so:
   \[ \text{Cost of family-size pizza} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 + 24 = 32 \]

Sally spends a total of $32."
"To determine the cost per razor after the discount, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Cost of Razors:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - Heather is buying 2 packs.
   - Total cost before any discounts: \(2 \times \$4.00 = \$8.00\).

2. **Applying the ""Buy One Get One Free"" Sale:**
   - With the ""buy one get one free"" offer, Heather only pays for one pack and gets the second one free.
   - Therefore, the cost after the sale: \$4.00 (for the first pack).

3. **Applying the $2.00 Coupon:**
   - Subtract the $2.00 coupon from the sale price.
   - Cost after the coupon: \$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00.

4. **Calculating the Cost per Razor:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - Total number of razors: \(2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors/pack} = 8 \text{ razors}\).
   - Cost per razor: \(\$2.00 \div 8 \text{ razors} = \$0.25 \text{ per razor}\).

5. **Converting to Cents:**
   - \$0.25 is equivalent to 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor, in cents, after the discount is 25 cents."
"To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to add the heights of the cheerleaders in the pyramid. The pyramid structure is as follows:

- 4 cheerleaders on the bottom
- 3 cheerleaders on top of the 4
- 2 cheerleaders on top of the 3
- 1 cheerleader (the shortest) at the top

Since 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall and the 10th is 60 inches tall, we can assume the shortest cheerleader is the one who is 60 inches tall.

Now, let's calculate the total height of the pyramid:

- Bottom layer (4 cheerleaders): \(4 \times 64 = 256\) inches
- Second layer (3 cheerleaders): \(3 \times 64 = 192\) inches
- Third layer (2 cheerleaders): \(2 \times 64 = 128\) inches
- Top layer (1 cheerleader): \(60\) inches

Adding these together gives the total height in inches:

\[256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches}\]

To convert this height into feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

\[636 \div 12 = 53 \text{ feet}\]

So, the height of the human pyramid is 53 feet."
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour, and she works for 8 hours each day. Therefore, each day she walks:

\[ 5 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \]

After 5 days, the total time she has walked is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, after 5 days at the office, Charisma has walked 200 minutes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be \(14 + 4 = 18\) years old.
3. At that time, Angela will be three times Brett's current age. Brett's current age is 14, so three times that is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

So, in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. To find out how old Angela is right now, we subtract 4 years from 42:

\[42 - 4 = 38\]

Angela is currently 38 years old.

38"
"Paul drives his car twice a day for 14 days. 

For the morning rides, he spends $6 each day, so for 14 days, he spends:
\[ 6 \times 14 = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

For the afternoon rides, he spends $2 each day, so for 14 days, he spends:
\[ 2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the costs of the morning and afternoon rides together, we get:
\[ 84 + 28 = 112 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Paul spent a total of $112 on driving his car during these two weeks."
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, let's find the total number of oranges both brought together:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges, we can calculate the number of pies they can make by dividing the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, they can make 40 Greek orange pies."
"To find the number of guests at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests as \( x \).

For the first venue, the total cost is the flat fee plus the cost of food:
\[ \text{Cost}_1 = 200 + 5x \]

For the second venue, the total cost is the cost per person for the venue plus the cost of food, but since the food is already included, the cost is just the cost per person for the venue:
\[ \text{Cost}_2 = 25x \]

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( \boxed{10} \)."
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \(D\), by Lily as \(L\), and by Bodhi as \(B\).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \(L + D + B = 43\)
2. \(L = D + 7\)
3. \(D = \frac{1}{2}B\)

First, we can express \(B\) in terms of \(D\) using the third equation:
\[B = 2D\]

Now, we can substitute \(L\) and \(B\) in terms of \(D\) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]
\[ 4D = 36 \]
\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know \(D = 9\), we can find \(L\) and \(B\):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Lily found \(16\) insects.

Lily found 16 insects."
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the amount of yarn each of them used and then add those amounts together.

First, let's calculate the amount of yarn Mariah used:
Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, Mariah used:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the amount of yarn Mariah's grandma used:
Her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein of yarn. So, she used:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we add the amounts of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma:
\[ 91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, they used 273 yards of yarn altogether."
"To find out how many gifts Cherrie bought in total, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Cherrie has 5 friends in total.
2. 2 of her friends want 5 gifts each. So, for these 2 friends, the total number of gifts is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) gifts.
3. The other 3 friends want 2 gifts each. So, for these 3 friends, the total number of gifts is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) gifts.
4. Cherrie decides to get 10 more random gifts.

Now, let's add all these together:

- Gifts for the 2 friends: 10
- Gifts for the 3 friends: 6
- Additional random gifts: 10

Total number of gifts = \(10 + 6 + 10 = 26\)

Cherrie bought a total of 26 gifts."
"Given that the chair is 3 feet wide, we can determine the width of the rug and then use that to find the length of the couch.

1. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair.
   - Width of the rug = Width of the chair + 5 feet
   - Width of the rug = 3 feet + 5 feet
   - Width of the rug = 8 feet

2. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug.
   - Length of the couch = 2 * Width of the rug + 2 feet
   - Length of the couch = 2 * 8 feet + 2 feet
   - Length of the couch = 16 feet + 2 feet
   - Length of the couch = 18 feet

The couch is 18 feet long."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. She bought two packs of strawberry gum.
3. She bought one pack of grape gum for $2.
4. She bought one small pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is $1 (since $2 / 2 = $1).
5. The total cost of all the gum is $7.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

The total cost can be represented by the equation:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

Each pack of strawberry gum cost $2."
"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, he should buy the cheapest lumber, which is the 2 x 4 piece of wood. Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks, and each costs $4.

Given Frederick has $24 to spend, he can buy:

\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

pieces of 2 x 4 wood.

Since each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks, the total number of sticks he can make is:

\[ 6 \times 200 = 1200 \]

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make if he buys the cheapest lumber is:

1200"
"To determine the cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the price per pair of snowshoes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
- Each dog has 4 legs.
- Mario has 6 dogs.
- Total number of legs = 6 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 24 legs.

Step 2: Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
- Each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs.
- Number of pairs of snowshoes = 24 legs / 2 legs/pair = 12 pairs.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the price per pair of snowshoes.
- Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
- Total cost = 12 pairs * $12.00/pair = $144.00.

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $144.00."
"Janet takes two bus trips each day, and she does this five days a week. So, the total number of trips she makes in a week is:

2 trips/day * 5 days/week = 10 trips/week

If each bus trip costs her $2.20, then the total cost for her weekly bus trips without a pass would be:

10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $22.00/week

If she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, then the cost for her bus trips would be $20.00.

To find out how much she would save by buying the weekly bus pass, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of the trips without the pass:

$22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00

So, Janet would save $2.00 by buying a weekly bus pass."
"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. 

The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, but the farm does not have any cows, so this statement is irrelevant to the farm's count.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, but the farm does not have any sheep, so this statement is also irrelevant to the farm's count.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo:

- The farm has 30 cows and 0 sheep, so the farm has a total of 30 animals.
- The zoo has 20 sheep and 0 cows, so the zoo has a total of 20 animals.

Adding these together, the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo is:

30 (farm's animals) + 20 (zoo's animals) = 50 animals

The farm and zoo have a combined total of 50 animals."
"Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought, we can determine the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought by dividing the quantities Rose bought by 4.

For onions:
\[ \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

For potatoes:
\[ \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add these quantities together:

Total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought: 4"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 pounds.
2. Determine the number of days Andy has to achieve this goal.
3. Calculate the daily calorie deficit required.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of calories to be burned.**

Andy wants to lose 30 pounds, and it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 pound. Therefore, the total number of calories to be burned is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Andy has to achieve this goal.**

Today is December 31st, and Andy's birthday is July 19th. The number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July (up to the 19th): 19 days

Adding these up:
\[ 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190 \text{ days} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the daily calorie deficit required.**

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total number of calories to be burned by the number of days:
\[ \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{190 \text{ days}} \approx 552.63 \text{ calories/day} \]

Therefore, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 553 calories to reach his goal."

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house:
\[ H = 3L \]
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost is $90,000."
"To calculate the profit Tara earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the canvas bags.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the bags.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the canvas bags.
Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, so she bought a total of \(8 \times 5 = 40\) canvas bags.
Each pack cost $4, so the total cost is \(40 \times 4 = \$160\).

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the bags.
Tara sold each bag for $8. Since she had 40 bags, the total revenue is \(40 \times 8 = \$320\).

Step 3: Calculate the profit.
Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, so the profit is \(320 - 160 = \$160\).

Therefore, the profit Tara earned on her bags is \(\boxed{160}\)."

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially.

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. So, the total amount from the $10 bills is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount from the $20 bills is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Ali has:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister. So, the amount given to his sister is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

The remaining amount after giving half to his sister is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's determine the picking rate for each person:

- Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
- Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby picks \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
- Kathy picks twice as many as Bobby, so Kathy picks \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
- Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky picks \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, we add up the picking rates of all four individuals to find the total number of quarts they can pick per hour:

\[6 \text{ (Tony)} + 5 \text{ (Bobby)} + 10 \text{ (Kathy)} + 8 \text{ (Ricky)} = 29\]

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is 29."

   \text{Batches of oatmeal cookies} = \frac{9 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cup per batch}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \text{ batches}
   \]

Therefore, Heather can make \(\boxed{12}\) batches of oatmeal cookies."
"First, let's calculate Ada's current weekly electric consumption and cost.

Ada's current daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. There are 24 hours in a day, so her daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh) is:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} = 288 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

To find her weekly consumption, we multiply by 7 days:
\[ 288 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 2016 \, \text{kWh/week} \]

At a rate of $1.50 per kWh, her weekly bill is:
\[ 2016 \, \text{kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$3024 \]

Next, let's calculate her new weekly consumption after adding the device.

The new device consumes 2 kWh per hour. So, her total daily consumption will be:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/hour} + 2 \, \text{kWh/hour} = 14 \, \text{kWh/hour} \]

Her new daily consumption in kWh is:
\[ 14 \, \text{kWh/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} = 336 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

Her new weekly consumption is:
\[ 336 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 2352 \, \text{kWh/week} \]

At the same rate of $1.50 per kWh, her new weekly bill is:
\[ 2352 \, \text{kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$3528 \]

Finally, the difference between her weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device is:
\[ \$3528 - \$3024 = \$504 \]

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is \$504."
"First, let's determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house (since 5 days for half a house means 10 days for a whole house).

Now, if one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, we can calculate the rate of painting per person per day. The rate is 1 house / 10 days = 0.1 houses per day.

If we have 5 people working together, their combined rate would be 5 * 0.1 houses per day = 0.5 houses per day.

To find out how many days it would take for 5 people to paint one whole house, we divide 1 house by their combined rate of 0.5 houses per day:

1 house / 0.5 houses per day = 2 days.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can calculate the total number of hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house:

2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"Given that Ophelia has 20 sofas, and she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can calculate the number of chairs Ophelia has as follows:

Ophelia's chairs = Ophelia's sofas + 2
Ophelia's chairs = 20 + 2
Ophelia's chairs = 22

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so:

Jenna's chairs = 3 * Ophelia's chairs
Jenna's chairs = 3 * 22
Jenna's chairs = 66

Since Ophelia and Jenna have the same number of sofas as chairs (2 fewer than the number of chairs they have), we can calculate Jenna's sofas as:

Jenna's sofas = Jenna's chairs - 2
Jenna's sofas = 66 - 2
Jenna's sofas = 64

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:

Total sofas = Ophelia's sofas + Jenna's sofas
Total sofas = 20 + 64
Total sofas = 84

Total chairs = Ophelia's chairs + Jenna's chairs
Total chairs = 22 + 66
Total chairs = 88

Total number of sofas and chairs = Total sofas + Total chairs
Total number of sofas and chairs = 84 + 88
Total number of sofas and chairs = 172

"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought without the headphone set, we first need to determine the cost of the headphone set.

1. We know that Tom paid a total of $48 for the CD and the headphone set.
2. The CD cost $4.
3. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set is $48 - $4 = $44.

Now, if Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have had the full $48 to spend on CDs.

4. Each CD costs $4.
5. To find out how many CDs he could buy with $48, we divide $48 by the cost of one CD: $48 / $4 = 12.

So, Tom would have been able to buy 12 CDs if he had not bought the headphone set.

Final numerical answer:
12"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours.

1. For 6 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week. So, the total for these weeks is \(6 \times 4 = 24\) hours.
2. For 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week. So, the total for these weeks is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
3. For 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours. So, the total for this week is \(1 \times 6 = 6\) hours.

Adding these together, the total number of hours he spent working out is \(24 + 10 + 6 = 40\) hours.

Total number of hours spent working out across the 8 weeks: 40"
"Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.

At the first stop:
- 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers becomes \(48 - 8 = 40\).
- 5 times as many people as those who got off get on the bus, which is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) passengers.

So after the first stop, the number of passengers is \(40 + 40 = 80\).

At the second stop:
- 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers becomes \(80 - 21 = 59\).
- 3 times fewer passengers get on than those who got off at the first stop, which means \( \frac{40}{3} \approx 13.33 \). Since the number of passengers must be a whole number, we assume it rounds to 13 passengers getting on.

So after the second stop, the number of passengers is \(59 + 13 = 72\).

Final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop: 72."
"First, let's determine Jame's current age. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, then his current age is:

\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out how old Jame will be in 8 years:

\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, we calculate twice Jame's age in 8 years and then subtract 5:

\[ 2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55 \]

This means that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 55 years old. To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55:

\[ 55 - 8 = 47 \]

Now, to find the current age difference between Jame and his cousin, we subtract Jame's current age from his cousin's current age:

\[ 47 - 22 = 25 \]

So, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Given that the computer cost $1,100 and Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can determine the cost of the printer as follows:

Cost of the printer = Cost of the computer - $400
Cost of the printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of the printer = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, the printer, and the two monitors is $2,400. We can set up the equation to find the cost of the monitors:

Total cost = Cost of the computer + Cost of the printer + 2 * Cost of one monitor
$2,400 = $1,100 + $700 + 2 * Cost of one monitor

Simplifying the equation:

$2,400 = $1,800 + 2 * Cost of one monitor

Subtract $1,800 from both sides to isolate the term with the cost of the monitors:

$2,400 - $1,800 = 2 * Cost of one monitor
$600 = 2 * Cost of one monitor

Divide both sides by 2 to find the cost of one monitor:

Cost of one monitor = $600 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $300

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300."
"The boys brought back 60 shells each. According to the problem, the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. 

So, the number of seashells each girl brought is:

60 (shells brought by boys) + 4 * 60 (four times the number of shells brought by the boys) = 60 + 240 = 300 seashells.

Each girl brought 300 seashells.

"Before George ate 5 candies, he had 3 + 5 = 8 candies.

Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 8 * 2 = 16 candies.

Therefore, Nick has 16 candies."
"Chenny is 10 years old.

Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, so Alyana is:
10 - 4 = 6 years old.

Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so Anne is:
6 + 2 = 8 years old.

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old."
"The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 mm = 62 mm thick.

To find the total thickness of the four books, we add their individual thicknesses together:

31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma should make to complete her monthly goal, we first need to calculate how many vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

Adding these up: \(18 + 21 + 15 = 54\) vlogs.

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs per month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:

\(72 - 54 = 18\)

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total bill including the tip:**
   - The base bill is $50.
   - The tip is 20% of $50.
   - 20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10.
   - So, the total bill including the tip is $50 + $10 = $60.

2. **Split the total bill evenly:**
   - Since the bill is to be split evenly between two people, each person pays half of the total bill.
   - Half of $60 = $60 / 2 = $30.

Therefore, you end up paying $30."
"First, let's determine how much each boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, each boy gets:

\[ \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The eldest boy then added $5 to his share:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

The following day, he added another $10:

\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

He then spent $8:

\[ 21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

After spending $8, he tripled the amount he had left:

\[ 13 \times 3 = 39 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount he has now is:

\[ \boxed{39} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to break down the month of April into two halves and determine the daily savings for each half.

April has 30 days, so the first half consists of the first 15 days and the second half consists of the last 15 days.

Let's denote the daily savings in the first half of April as \( x \). Therefore, the total savings for the first half of April would be \( 15x \).

According to the problem, Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half of April. So, the daily savings in the second half would be \( 2x \). The total savings for the second half of April would then be \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

Elvis's total savings for the month of April should be $1125. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 45:

\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of April. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he needs to save:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To find out how much change Verna received, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits she bought.

1. The cost of the apples: \(3 \times \$1.50 = \$4.50\)
2. The cost of the oranges: \(5 \times \$0.80 = \$4.00\)
3. The cost of the peaches: \(6 \times \$0.75 = \$4.50\)

Now, we add up the costs of all the fruits:
\[
\$4.50 + \$4.00 + \$4.50 = \$13.00

Therefore, the change Verna received is \(\$7.00\)."
"To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we need to calculate the total earnings for each and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate Jairus's total earnings:
- Jairus gets $0.8 per task.
- He completed 20 tasks.

So, Jairus's total earnings = $0.8 * 20 = $16.

Next, let's calculate Jenny's total earnings:
- Jenny gets $0.5 per task.
- She also completed 20 tasks.

So, Jenny's total earnings = $0.5 * 20 = $10.

Now, we find the difference between Jairus's and Jenny's earnings:
- Difference = Jairus's earnings - Jenny's earnings
- Difference = $16 - $10 = $6.

Therefore, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny."
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. Each round of calls multiplies the number of families notified by a factor of 3.

1. In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.
2. In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 more families, so \(3 \times 3 = 9\) new families are notified.
3. In the third round, each of the 9 families calls 3 more families, so \(9 \times 3 = 27\) new families are notified.
4. In the fourth round, each of the 27 families calls 3 more families, so \(27 \times 3 = 81\) new families are notified.

Therefore, during the fourth round of calls, 81 families will be notified.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to determine the number of toys in James's play set. According to the problem, James's play set has 80 toys.

2. Jonathan wants to have a sorted play set that is five times larger than James's play set. Therefore, the number of toys Jonathan wants to have is:
   \[
   5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys}

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 398 toys."
"To calculate the total cost Daniel has to spend, we first need to find the cost of each item he wants to buy without the discount, then apply the 10% discount to the total.

1. Cost of five notebooks: \(5 \times \$1.50 = \$7.50\)
2. Cost of two pens: \(2 \times \$0.25 = \$0.50\)
3. Cost of one calculator: \(1 \times \$12 = \$12.00\)
4. Cost of one geometry set: \(1 \times \$10 = \$10.00\)

Now, we add these amounts to get the total cost before the discount:
\[ \$7.50 + \$0.50 + \$12.00 + \$10.00 = \$30.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$30.00 = 0.10 \times \$30.00 = \$3.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ \$30.00 - \$3.00 = \$27.00 \]

Therefore, Daniel has to spend \(\$27.00\) on all the items he wants to buy."

"When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does in cold water. So, we calculate the time for a mile in warm water as follows:

Twice the time in cold water: \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes
Plus 2 more minutes: \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes

So, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes on a hot day.

To find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day, we calculate the time for 3 miles in both conditions:

Cold water: \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes
Warm water: \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes

The difference in time is:
\(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the movement of the sun relative to the pyramid and how this affects the angle from the ground to the sun.

1. The initial angle of the pyramid from the ground is 32 degrees.
2. The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which means the initial angle from the ground to the sun is also 32 degrees.
3. The sun moves 5 degrees an hour straight upward. Over 10 hours, the sun will move \(5 \times 10 = 50\) degrees upward.
4. Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid (32 degrees from the ground), after 10 hours, the angle from the ground to the sun will be the initial angle plus the upward movement: \(32 + 50 = 82\) degrees.

Next, we need to find out how many candles James needs. Since he needs one candle for each year of age, he needs 12 candles for the older son and 8 candles for the younger son, which totals 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Now, we need to figure out how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Since each pack contains 5 candles, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: 20 / 5 = 4 packs.

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pack costs $3, so for 4 packs, the total cost is 4 * $3 = $12.

James spends $12 on candles."
"First, let's calculate how many minutes Judy read each night in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, the total reading time in the first week is:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pages she read in the first week. Given that she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she reads per minute by dividing 2 pages by 1.5 minutes:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages she read in the first week by multiplying the reading time by the reading rate:

\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages she read in two weeks is the sum of the pages read in the first and second weeks:

\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

So, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

\[ 240 \]"
"Cody ate a third of the 12 sandwiches, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Trevor ate a quarter of the 12 sandwiches, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Together, they ate:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Therefore, the number of sandwiches left is:
\[ 12 - 7 = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \]

5 sandwiches are left."
"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so \( S = 44 \).
2. In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, in 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \) and his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \).

The relationship given in the problem can be expressed as:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substituting \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Dividing both sides by 3:
\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Subtracting 7 from both sides:
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

Final numerical answer:
10"
"The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.

For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave $1.00 per tooth. So, for three teeth, the total is:
\[ 3 \times \$1.00 = \$3.00 \]

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of money per tooth as for the previous three teeth. Since the previous amount was $1.00, half of that is $0.50. So, for two teeth, the total is:
\[ 2 \times \$0.50 = \$1.00 \]

Adding all these amounts together:
\[ \$5.00 + \$3.00 + \$1.00 = \$9.00 \]

The tooth fairy left Sharon a total of $9.00."
"Given that Richie scored 80 goals, and he scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can determine the number of goals Mark scored as follows:

\[ \text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Next, since Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, we can determine the number of goals Anna scored as follows:

\[ \text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:

\[ \text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} \]
\[ \text{Total goals} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

Therefore, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is 175."
"To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we first need to calculate how much money each of them made.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each. So, the total amount of money Mitchell made is:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Liam made $63.

Now, to find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:
\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Mitchell made 21 more dollars than Liam that weekend."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into a few steps:

1. Calculate how much Peter spends each day from Sunday through Wednesday.
2. Determine how much money Peter has left after Wednesday.
3. Calculate how many plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining money from Thursday through Sunday.
4. Sum the total number of action figures he buys.

First, let's find out how much Peter spends each day from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spends an equal amount each day and he has $70 for the week, we divide $70 by 7 days:

\[ \frac{70}{7} = 10 \]

So, Peter spends $10 each day. From Sunday through Wednesday, he spends:

\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

This means he has:

\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

left after Wednesday.

Next, we need to find out how many plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining $40. Each plastic action figure costs $2, so he can buy:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

plastic action figures from Thursday through Sunday.

Now, we need to calculate the total number of action figures he buys. From Sunday through Wednesday, he buys:

\[ 3 \times \frac{10}{5} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

wooden action figures (since each wooden action figure costs $5).

Adding the wooden and plastic action figures together, we get:

\[ 6 + 20 = 26 \]

So, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"To find out how much the kitten has cost Leah so far, we need to add up the costs of the spaying, the vaccines, and the broken vases.

1. Spaying cost: $200
2. Cost of 3 vaccines: $20 each, so 3 * $20 = $60
3. Cost of 4 broken vases: $12 each, so 4 * $12 = $48

Now, we add these amounts together:

$200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (vases) = $308

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total revenue and the total cost, then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.
   - Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Cost of bread: Each loaf costs $3.00 and makes 10 sandwiches.
     - Cost of bread for 10 sandwiches = $3.00
   - Cost of cheeses and condiments: $30.00 for 10 sandwiches.
     - Cost of cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches = $30.00
   - Total cost for 10 sandwiches = Cost of bread + Cost of cheeses and condiments
     - Total cost for 10 sandwiches = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

3. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day, we first need to calculate the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

Here's the breakdown:

- Days one and two: 50 birds
- Day three: 0 birds
- Days four and five: 120 birds
- Day six: 20 birds
- Day seven: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

Number of days = 7

Average number of birds per day = Total number of birds / Number of days
= 280 / 7
= 40

So, on average, Mack saw 40 birds in a day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Diane starts with a number, which is 20.
2. She adds half of this number to it, which is \(20 + \frac{20}{2} = 20 + 10 = 30\).
3. She then divides this result by 5, which is \(\frac{30}{5} = 6\).
4. Finally, she multiplies this result by the starting value minus 12, which is \(20 - 12 = 8\). So, \(6 \times 8 = 48\).

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees.

First, let's calculate the percentage error in the temperature setting:

\[ \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Temperature} - \text{Set Temperature}}{\text{Set Temperature}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Error} = 0.04 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Error} = 4\% \]

Now, we know the oven is 4% too hot. To find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to set the oven to a temperature that is 4% lower than 520 degrees.

Let \( T \) be the temperature Maggie should set her oven to. The relationship can be expressed as:

\[ T = 520 \times (1 - 0.04) \]
\[ T = 520 \times 0.96 \]
\[ T = 499.2 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 499.2 degrees."
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, the first movie is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours into minutes gives:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]
Adding the 5 minutes gives:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 125 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the durations of the two movies together:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 125 \text{ minutes} = 215 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate how much 30% of Herb's house price is, and then subtract that from Herb's house price.

1. Calculate 30% of $76,000:
\[ 30\% \times 76,000 = 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

2. Subtract that amount from Herb's house price to find the value of Juan's house:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

So, Juan's house is worth $53,200.

3. Now, add the value of both houses to find the combined value:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy brought, which means her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups brought by both Judy and her friend is 12 + 40 = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes brought by both is 24 + 44 = 68 dishes.

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two is 52 + 68 = 120.

"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount. 

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per contact when buying 2 boxes is $1.00. However, the question asks for the cost per pair of contacts. Since the problem does not specify that contacts are sold in pairs, we assume the cost per contact is the relevant measure. If we interpret ""pair"" as a unit of two contacts, the cost per pair would be:
\[ 1.00 \times 2 = 2.00 \]

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \boxed{2.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours worked by Jill and John.

Jill worked:
- 2 hours on Saturday
- 1 hour on Sunday
Total hours for Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

John worked:
- Twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday
- Three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday
Total hours for John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours

Now, let's calculate the earnings for each.

Jill's earnings:
- $10 per hour * 3 hours = $30

John's earnings:
- $10 per hour * 7 hours = $70

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:
- John's earnings - Jill's earnings = $70 - $30 = $40

John earned $40 more than Jill.

Therefore, John earned $40 more than Jill."
"First, let's calculate the total calories Hannah burns from aerobics and running.

- Aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
- Running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Now, according to the given ratio, Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. So, we can calculate the total amount of water she needs to drink as follows:

Total water needed = (Total calories burned / 200 calories) * 100 ml
Total water needed = (1600 calories / 200 calories) * 100 ml
Total water needed = 8 * 100 ml
Total water needed = 800 ml

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the note on the jar:
- The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as \( 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- Red jelly beans: \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Green jelly beans: \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

The difference between the number of green and red jelly beans is:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."

3. **Difference in weight change:**
   - Weight change with donuts: +8.75 pounds
   - Weight change with Cheerios: -6.25 pounds
   - Difference: \(8.75 \, \text{pounds} - (-6.25 \, \text{pounds}) = 8.75 \, \text{pounds} + 6.25 \, \text{pounds} = 15 \, \text{pounds}\)

The difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating donuts and Cheerios for breakfast is 15 pounds."
"To determine the total number of seats Alex will need, we need to account for all the people who will be attending the event.

1. Alex initially invites 100 people via email.
2. Each of these 100 people will also invite 2 friends. So, the number of additional people invited by email invites is \(100 \times 2 = 200\).
3. Alex also calls 10 of her friends and invites them. So, there are 10 more people invited this way.
4. Out of these 10 friends, 8 will bring their spouses. So, there are 8 additional people (spouses) coming.

Now, let's sum up all the attendees:
- Initial email invites: 100
- Additional people from email invites: 200
- Friends invited by phone: 10
- Spouses: 8

Total number of seats needed = \(100 + 200 + 10 + 8 = 318\)

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats."

"To determine how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we need to calculate the total cost for each platform and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the boots on Amazon:
- Cost of boots: $16
- Shipping cost: $4
- Total cost on Amazon: $16 + $4 = $20

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the boots on eBay:
- Cost of boots: $13
- Shipping cost: Twice the cost of Amazon's shipping, so $4 * 2 = $8
- Total cost on eBay: $13 + $8 = $21

Now, we find the difference in total cost between eBay and Amazon:
- Total cost on eBay: $21
- Total cost on Amazon: $20
- Difference: $21 - $20 = $1

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to grow taller than 20 feet, given that it doubles its height every day and starts at 4 feet tall.

Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk day by day:

- Day 0: 4 feet
- Day 1: 4 feet * 2 = 8 feet
- Day 2: 8 feet * 2 = 16 feet
- Day 3: 16 feet * 2 = 32 feet

On Day 3, the beanstalk reaches 32 feet, which is taller than the 20 feet required to be taller than Mark's window.

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the weekly protein intake based on daily consumption.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, 200 grams (which is double the amount) would contain double the protein:

\[ 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} \times \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

So, John gets 6 grams of protein from 200 grams of mushrooms each day.

Next, to find out how much protein he gets in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ 6 \text{ grams of protein/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein/week} \]

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms daily."
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
Subtract \( 2J \) from both sides:
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

1. The base price for 2 implants is $2000 each, so:
   \[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

2. For one of the implants, there is an additional cost for a porcelain crown, which is $500. So, the total cost for the dental work is:
   \[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

3. George has already put down a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
   \[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

4. George makes $15 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
   \[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:

\[ x = 30 \]

Now, we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees."
"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has in nickels. Each gumball costs a nickel, so we need to find out how many nickels he can get from his other coins.

1. Convert all his coins to nickels:
   - 8 quarters: \(8 \times 5 = 40\) nickels
   - 6 dimes: \(6 \times 2 = 12\) nickels
   - 14 nickels: \(14\) nickels
   - 15 pennies: \(15 \div 5 = 3\) nickels

2. Add all the nickels together:
   \[40 + 12 + 14 + 3 = 69\] nickels

3. Since each gumball costs 1 nickel, the number of gumballs Colby can buy is equal to the total number of nickels he has.

Therefore, Colby can buy \(\boxed{69}\) gumballs."
"To find the total number of legs the pets in the store have, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

- Dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- Cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- Birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:

\(20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}\)

Therefore, the total number of legs the pets in the store have is 48."
"Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He increases the weight by 50%, so the new weight is:

\[ 8 \text{ pounds} + (0.50 \times 8 \text{ pounds}) = 8 \text{ pounds} + 4 \text{ pounds} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, he uses a weight that is two pounds lighter than 12 pounds:

\[ 12 \text{ pounds} - 2 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

The weight that he now uses is 10 pounds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Games**: Steve gets 5 games for his birthday.
2. **First Year**: He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so he buys 12 games.
3. **Second Year**: He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so he buys 24 games.
4. **Third Year**: He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, so he buys 48 games.
5. **Christmas Gifts**: He gets 5 games every year for 3 years, so he gets 15 games in total.

Now, let's add all these up:

- Initial games: 5
- First year: 12
- Second year: 24
- Third year: 48
- Christmas gifts: 15

Total games = 5 + 12 + 24 + 48 + 15 = 104

So, after 3 years, Steve has 104 games."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The speed can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Given that the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, the speed of the plane is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate.

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolate Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds of chocolate Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds as Ruiz in an hour:

\[ 60 \times \frac{3}{4} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we find out how many pounds of chocolate Ruiz and Marissa can make together in one hour:

\[ 60 + 45 = 105 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Since they worked for 12 hours in a day, we multiply the total amount they can make in one hour by 12:

\[ 105 \times 12 = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together in 12 hours is:

\[ 1260 \text{ pounds} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Howard spends each day and then subtract the total from his original amount of $100.

1. On Monday, Howard spends $8.
2. On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
3. On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as on Tuesday, which is \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, let's add up the total amount spent over the three days:
\[ 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \]

Howard originally had $100. After spending $88, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 100 - 88 = 12 \]

Therefore, Howard has $12 left."
"To calculate the total money Patrick earned, we need to break down the earnings into two parts: the first four hours and the next two hours.

For the first four hours:
- He sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Therefore, in one hour, he earned 15 cups * $0.50 = $7.50.
- Over four hours, he earned 4 hours * $7.50 = $30.

For the next two hours:
- He sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Therefore, in one hour, he earned 10 cups * $0.60 = $6.00.
- Over two hours, he earned 2 hours * $6.00 = $12.

Adding the earnings from both periods:
- Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42.

Patrick earned a total of $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations per tire for Jeremy's monthly driving.
2. Determine the total number of rotations per tire over a year.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations per tire for Jeremy's monthly driving.**

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
\[ \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/rotation cycle}} \times 725 \text{ rotations/cycle} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of rotations per tire over a year.**

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of rotations per tire in a year is:
\[ 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.**

To find out how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations, we divide the total number of rotations by the number of rotations per year:
\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the tire will need to be replaced in \(\boxed{6}\) years."
"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of washings per pump.
2. Determine the cost per washing.
3. Calculate the cost per pump.

First, we know that 2 pumps of shampoo give 120 washings. Therefore, 1 pump would give half of that number of washings:

\[ \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per washing. The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, and it provides 120 washings:

\[ \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{24.00}{120} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \]

Since 0.20 dollars is equivalent to 20 cents, the cost per washing is 20 cents. Now, we need to find the cost per pump. Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost per pump is:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = 60 \times 0.20 = 12 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost per pump is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's calculate the discount on the items Joe wants to buy. The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35. The total cost before the discount is:

\[ 25 + 35 = 60 \]

Since there is a 30% off sale, Joe will only pay 70% of the total cost. The discount amount is:

\[ 60 \times 0.30 = 18 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:

\[ 60 - 18 = 42 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After buying the shirt and shorts, the amount of money he will have left is:

\[ 50 - 42 = 8 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the amount of butter needed for the total number of dozens of croissants.

First, Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days. So, the total number of dozens of croissants he will make in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we know that it takes \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, for 28 dozen croissants, the amount of butter needed is:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make these croissants."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we first need to calculate the cost of repaving each street.

1. Calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:
   - Cost per meter = $194
   - Length of Monica's street = 150 meters
   - Cost for Monica's street = $194 * 150 = $29,100

2. Calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:
   - Cost per meter = $194
   - Length of Lewis' street = 490 meters
   - Cost for Lewis' street = $194 * 490 = $95,060

3. Find the difference in cost between Lewis' street and Monica's street:
   - Difference in cost = Cost for Lewis' street - Cost for Monica's street
   - Difference in cost = $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

The final numerical answer is:
$65,960"
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining 5 months.

1. **Cost for the first 5 months:**
   - Initial funding: $100,000

2. **Cost for the remaining 5 months:**
   - The research took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so the remaining period is \(10 - 5 = 5\) months.
   - Each of these months cost 50% more than the previous month. This means the cost for each of these months is 1.5 times the cost of the previous month.

Let's calculate the cost for each of the remaining 5 months:

- Month 6: \(100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000\)
- Month 7: \(150,000 \times 1.5 = 225,000\)
- Month 8: \(225,000 \times 1.5 = 337,500\)
- Month 9: \(337,500 \times 1.5 = 506,250\)
- Month 10: \(506,250 \times 1.5 = 759,375\)

Now, we sum up the costs for the remaining 5 months:

\[150,000 + 225,000 + 337,500 + 506,250 + 759,375 = 1,978,125\]

Finally, we add the cost of the first 5 months to the cost of the remaining 5 months:

\[100,000 + 1,978,125 = 2,078,125\]

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is $2,078,125."
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to add up the ounces of meat each player ate.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, this is 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these together:

6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 20 + 16 = 36 ounces

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 36 ounces."
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days in March.
2. Calculate the total number of posts per day for the entire group.
3. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in March.

March typically has 31 days.

Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day. With 1000 members, the total number of posts per day for the group is:
\[ 1000 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ posts/member/day} = 3000 \text{ posts/day} \]

Now, to find the total number of posts in March:
\[ 3000 \text{ posts/day} \times 31 \text{ days} = 93000 \text{ posts} \]

So, the total number of posts that the group will have in March is:

Therefore, after 3 weeks, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall."
"To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of meat from the bull.
2. Determine how much meat Prince sells in one day.
3. Calculate the number of days required to sell all the meat.

First, the total amount of meat from the bull is 750kg.

Next, Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day. Therefore, the amount of meat he sells in one day is:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Now, to find out how many days it will take Prince to sell 750kg of meat, we divide the total amount of meat by the amount he sells per day:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

"First, let's calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, so the total number of seats is:

\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \]

Next, we need to find out how many seats were occupied by the administrators. Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \]

This means 18 seats were occupied by the administrators. Now, we need to find out how many seats were left after the administrators took their seats:

\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \]

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

This means 18 seats were occupied by the parents. Now, we need to find out how many seats were left for the students. We subtract the number of seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats:

\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is:

3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow to the required height.

First, let's convert Adam's current height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide Adam's height by 12:

\[ \text{Adam's current height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how much taller Adam needs to be to meet the 4 feet requirement:

\[ \text{Height difference} = 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:

\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, we can calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet:

\[ \text{Years required} = \frac{\frac{2}{3} \text{ feet}}{\frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year}} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.
2. Calculate the total cost to the company for acquiring the cars.
3. Determine the profit.
4. Calculate James's commission on the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.**

James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost to the company for acquiring the cars.**

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
\[ \text{Cost per car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000 \]

**Step 3: Determine the profit.**

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

**Step 4: Calculate James's commission on the profit.**

James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
\[ \text{Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

**Final Answer:**
\[ \boxed{17500} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many of the 100 riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate:

\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \]

So, 25 riders can stay upright.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are men. We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, which means 40% are men. Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is:

\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Given:
- The price of a diamond jewel is $2000.
- The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel.
- The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.

First, calculate the price of the gold jewel:
\[ \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \]

Next, calculate the price of the silver jewel:
\[ \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200 \]

Now, find the total price for all three jewels:
\[ \text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800 \]

The total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and then sum them up.

1. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so the number of truck stamps is \(16 + 3 = 19\).
3. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so the number of rose stamps is \(19 - 9 = 10\).

Now, we add up all the stamps:
\[16 \text{ (snowflake)} + 19 \text{ (truck)} + 10 \text{ (rose)} = 45\]

Therefore, Max bought a total of 45 stamps."
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob. 

Bob is driving at 55 mph, and Tom is driving at 70 mph. The difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, we can find the time it takes for Tom to catch up by dividing the distance by the relative speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"Naomi caught 17 fish.

Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, so Darren caught:
17 - 6 = 11 fish.

Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so Tommy caught:
11 + 3 = 14 fish.

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we first need to calculate the maximum total cost that would still allow the cost per class to be $10 or less.

Given:
- Total cost for 10 classes = $60
- Cost per class if 10 classes are attended = $60 / 10 = $6
- Maximum cost per class allowed = $10

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as \( x \). If he misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class in this scenario would be \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \).

We need to find the maximum \( x \) such that the cost per class does not exceed $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes and still have the cost per class be $10 or less. If he misses 5 or more classes, the cost per class will exceed $10.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel. Since Jewel processes 50 customers per day, Julie would process \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers per day.

Together, they process \(50 + 100 = 150\) customers per day.

Since they work all days of the week, the total weekly production for the two of them would be \(150 \times 7 = 1050\) customers.

Total weekly production for the two: 1050"
"Paisley ran 4 miles.

Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran \(5 \times 4 = 20\) miles.

Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so Lynn ran \(20 - 3 = 17\) miles.

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles."
"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

1. **Cost of one apple:**
   - Four apples cost $5.20.
   - Therefore, the cost of one apple is \( \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of one orange:**
   - Three oranges cost $3.30.
   - Therefore, the cost of one orange is \( \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost for 5 apples:**
   - Since one apple costs $1.30, 5 apples will cost \( 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \) dollars.

4. **Total cost for 5 oranges:**
   - Since one orange costs $1.10, 5 oranges will cost \( 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \) dollars.

5. **Total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:**
   - Adding the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we get \( 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \) dollars.

Therefore, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) it will take him to dig the hole is:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price of the truck to the cost of each of the additional features.

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so \( \frac{1}{3} \times 7500 = 2500 \) dollars
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so \( 2500 - 500 = 2000 \) dollars
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1500

Now, we add all these costs together:

\[ 30000 + 7500 + 2500 + 2000 + 1500 = 43500 \]

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"First, let's calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise:

\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \text{Original Monthly Salary} + (\text{Original Monthly Salary} \times \text{Raise Percentage}) \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$20000 + (\$20000 \times 0.05) \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$20000 + \$1000 \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$21000 \]

Next, we add the bonus, which is half a month's salary:

\[ \text{Bonus} = \frac{\text{New Monthly Salary}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Bonus} = \frac{\$21000}{2} \]
\[ \text{Bonus} = \$10500 \]

Now, we calculate Tim's total monthly earnings including the bonus:

\[ \text{Total Monthly Earnings} = \text{New Monthly Salary} + \text{Bonus} \]
\[ \text{Total Monthly Earnings} = \$21000 + \$10500 \]
\[ \text{Total Monthly Earnings} = \$31500 \]

Finally, to find out how much money Tim will make in a year, we multiply his total monthly earnings by 12:

\[ \text{Annual Earnings} = \text{Total Monthly Earnings} \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Annual Earnings} = \$31500 \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Annual Earnings} = \$378000 \]

Therefore, Tim will make $378,000 in a year."
"To find the total cost of everything James bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of suits:**
   - James buys 10 suits.
   - Each suit costs $750.
   - Total cost for suits = 10 suits * $750/suit = $7500.

2. **Cost of dress pants:**
   - James buys 10 dress pants.
   - Each dress pant costs 1/5 the cost of a suit.
   - Cost of one dress pant = $750 / 5 = $150.
   - Total cost for dress pants = 10 dress pants * $150/dress pant = $1500.

3. **Cost of dress shirts:**
   - James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
   - He has 10 suits, so he buys 10 * 3 = 30 dress shirts.
   - Each dress shirt costs $60.
   - Total cost for dress shirts = 30 dress shirts * $60/dress shirt = $1800.

4. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of suits + Cost of dress pants + Cost of dress shirts.
   - Total cost = $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

The final numerical answer is:
$10800."
"To calculate the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to follow these steps:

"To find the total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley, we first calculate the distance each person biked individually and then sum these distances.

For Alisa:
- Speed: 12 miles per hour
- Time: 4.5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles

For Stanley:
- Speed: 10 miles per hour
- Time: 2.5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances together to get the total miles biked:
- Total distance = Distance biked by Alisa + Distance biked by Stanley = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

Therefore, the total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To calculate the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to determine the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add these times together.

First, let's calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He has to dig 24 feet of soil.
- Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.

Next, let's calculate the time to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs half as fast through clay, which is 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour.
- He has to dig 8 feet of clay.
- Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

Now, we add the time to dig through the soil and the time to dig through the clay:
- Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

Therefore, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well."

Therefore, the total number of Instagram likes is 162000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost Clara paid for her pomegranates on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the voucher was:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She got a $2 discount, so the final amount she paid was:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost Sheila paid for her pomegranates on Wednesday.

The price per pomegranate on Wednesday was $30, so the total cost before the discount was:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

Sheila got a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount was:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final amount she paid was:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \text{ dollars} \]

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - Ariadne's sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
   - The sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from green hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month were \( 400 \times 2 = 800 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first month:**
   - Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total sales in the first month = \( 400 + 800 = 1200 \) dollars.

3. **Determine the sales for the second month:**
   - The sales in the second month were \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total sales of the first month.
   - Therefore, the sales in the second month = \( 1200 \times \frac{3}{4} = 900 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total sales for the two months:**
   - Total sales for two months = Sales in the first month + Sales in the second month
   - Total sales for two months = \( 1200 + 900 = 2100 \) dollars.

"James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he is charged for 3 hours.

The first paid hour costs $15. Each hour after that is twice the cost, so the second hour costs $15 * 2 = $30, and the third hour costs $30 * 2 = $60.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of each hour:
$15 (first hour) + $30 (second hour) + $60 (third hour) = $105.

Therefore, James paid $105."
"Sally's bank account increased from $200 to $420 during the week. This means she received an additional $220 in the week. Since her weekly wage should be $300, the amount withheld from her wage is the difference between her expected wage and the additional money in her account.

To find the amount withheld, we subtract the additional money in her account from her expected weekly wage:

$300 (expected wage) - $220 (additional money) = $80

The amount withheld from Sally’s wage is $80."

"To calculate the total cost for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly hanger rental cost, and the monthly fuel cost.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane**: $150,000
2. **Monthly Hanger Rental Cost**: $5,000
3. **Monthly Fuel Cost**: Twice the hanger rental cost, which is $5,000 * 2 = $10,000

Now, let's calculate the total monthly cost for maintaining the plane:
\[ \text{Total Monthly Cost} = \text{Hanger Rental Cost} + \text{Fuel Cost} = \$5,000 + \$10,000 = \$15,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the first year:
\[ \text{Total Yearly Cost} = \text{Total Monthly Cost} \times 12 = \$15,000 \times 12 = \$180,000 \]

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the yearly maintenance cost:

"Given that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, we can use this information to find out the cooking times for the other ingredients.

1. **Cooking time for rice (R):** 30 minutes
2. **Cooking time for pork (P):** It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. So, \( P = R + 20 \). Substituting the value of R, we get \( P = 30 + 20 = 50 \) minutes.
3. **Cooking time for beans (B):** Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. So, \( B = \frac{1}{2} (P + R) \). Substituting the values of P and R, we get \( B = \frac{1}{2} (50 + 30) = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \) minutes.

Now, to find the total cooking time for all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans:

\[ \text{Total cooking time} = R + P + B = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \]

So, it took Finley 120 minutes to cook all the food."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):

- Cost of 1/2 pound almonds: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars
- Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars
- Total cost of the first mixture: \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):

- Cost of 1/5 pound almonds: \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars
- Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars
- Total cost of the second mixture: \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:
1. The total number of heads is 20, so:
\[ S + G = 20 \]

2. The total number of legs is 70, so:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To solve for \( S \) and \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the cost of the other items Gus bought from the total amount he spent.

1. Cost of 2 bags of chips: \(2 \times \$2.00 = \$4.00\)
2. Cost of the bucket of fried chicken: \$8.00
3. Cost of the bottle of soda: \$1.00

Total cost of these items: \(\$4.00 + \$8.00 + \$1.00 = \$13.00\)

Gus spent a total of \$20.00. So, the cost of the apple pie is:

\(\$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00\)

The apple pie cost \$7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

Total newspapers delivered in a day = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers - (Newspapers to District A + Newspapers to District C)

Let's calculate:

Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - (198 + 209)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 407
Newspapers delivered to District B = 193

James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."
"To determine how many recipes John learns, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours John spends in the class.
2. Determine how many recipes he learns based on the total hours of class time.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours John spends in the class:

- The class meets 4 times a week.
- Each session is 2 hours long.
- The class runs for 6 weeks.

So, the total number of hours is:
\[ 4 \text{ sessions/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/session} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how many recipes he learns. He learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. Therefore, we divide the total hours by 1.5:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ hours}}{1.5 \text{ hours/recipe}} = 32 \text{ recipes} \]

So, John learns 32 recipes."
"First, let's determine the number of history teachers on the basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

So, there are 90 history teachers. Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ 60 \text{ teachers} \times 6 \text{ hours/teacher} = 360 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours."
"First, let's determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's amount as follows:

\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, we know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's amount as follows:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, we add together the amounts of money that Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia have:

\[ \text{Total money} = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360 \]

If they decide to share the money equally, each person would get:

\[ \text{Each person's share} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \]

So, if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them, each would have \(\boxed{120}\) dollars."
"The game originally consists of 4 quarters, each 12 minutes long. So, the total time for the 4 quarters is:

4 quarters * 12 minutes/quarter = 48 minutes

Since there was a tie in the last quarter and the game was extended for an additional 5 minutes, we add this to the original time:

48 minutes + 5 minutes = 53 minutes

The entire game lasted 53 minutes."
"First, we calculate the number of employees who are in management. Since 20% of the 50 employees are management, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 management employees.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 10 management employees oversee the entire company. Since 30% of the management employees oversee the entire company, we calculate:

\[ 30\% \times 10 = 0.30 \times 10 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of employees who oversee the company is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To calculate the total tablespoons of dry ingredients Svetlana would need for 16 muffins, we first need to determine the total amount of flour, sugar, and salt required for one muffin, and then multiply by 16.

For one muffin:
- Flour: 5 tablespoons
- Sugar: 3 tablespoons
- Salt: 0.25 tablespoon

Total dry ingredients for one muffin = 5 + 3 + 0.25 = 8.25 tablespoons

For 16 muffins:
Total dry ingredients = 8.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 132 tablespoons

Therefore, Svetlana would need 132 tablespoons of dry ingredients to make 16 muffins."
"To find out how much candy each person would have if they share equally, we first need to calculate the total amount of candy they have together.

Robert has 3 pounds, Cindy has 5 pounds, and Aaron has 4 pounds. So, the total amount of candy is:

\[ 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to divide this total amount equally among the three of them. So, we divide 12 pounds by 3:

\[ \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, if they share the candy equally, each of them would have:

\[ \boxed{4 \text{ pounds}} \]"
"To find out how much change Adam got, we first need to calculate the total cost of the candies he bought.

1. Calculate the cost of type A candies:
   - Adam bought 7 candies of type A.
   - Each candy of type A costs $0.5.
   - Total cost for type A candies = 7 * $0.5 = $3.5.

2. Calculate the cost of type B candies:
   - Adam bought 10 candies of type B.
   - Each candy of type B costs $0.75.
   - Total cost for type B candies = 10 * $0.75 = $7.5.

3. Calculate the total cost of all candies:
   - Total cost = Cost of type A candies + Cost of type B candies
   - Total cost = $3.5 + $7.5 = $11.

4. Calculate the change Adam received:
   - Adam paid $15.
   - Total cost of candies = $11.
   - Change = $15 - $11 = $4.

Therefore, Adam got $4 in change."
"Christina had a total of 30 days of mood records. Out of these, 12 were good, 8 were bad, and the rest were neutral. 

First, let's calculate the number of neutral days:
- Total days = 30
- Good days = 12
- Bad days = 8
- Neutral days = Total days - Good days - Bad days
- Neutral days = 30 - 12 - 8 = 10

Now, let's account for the next three days:
- The next three days are good, neutral, and good.
- This adds 2 more good days to her record.

So, the total number of good days now is:
- Original good days = 12
- Additional good days = 2
- Total good days = 12 + 2 = 14

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 14."
"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To find the number of books Sally has, we need to solve for \( S \):
\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches.
2. Calculate the total height increase needed for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.
3. Determine how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow the required additional height.

Step 1: Convert the current height from feet to inches.
- 1 foot = 12 inches
- Current height = 20 feet = 20 * 12 inches = 240 inches

Step 2: Calculate the total height increase needed.
- Target height = 600 inches
- Current height = 240 inches
- Height increase needed = 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Step 3: Determine the number of days required.
- Growth rate = 30 inches per day
- Number of days = Height increase needed / Growth rate = 360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches.

12 days"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are 8 more dogs, so now there are 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
3. James buys toys for these 12 dogs, so he now has 12 toys.
4. When he returns, there are twice as many dogs as before, so there are 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.
5. To accommodate these 24 dogs, James needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys.
6. After buying these toys, there are 12 + 12 = 24 toys in total.
7. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs toys for those 3 dogs.
8. Therefore, he no longer needs 3 toys.

Now, let's calculate the total number of toys James needs:

- Initially, he had 4 toys.
- He bought 12 more toys for the 8 additional dogs.
- He then bought 12 more toys to accommodate the increase to 24 dogs.
- He no longer needs 3 toys because 3 dogs are gone.

So, the total number of toys he needs is 4 (initial) + 12 (first purchase) + 12 (second purchase) - 3 (dogs gone) = 25 toys.

Total number of toys James needs: 25."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The total initial investment is $1200.

2. Dylan invests 2/5 of the total amount:
   \[
   \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = 480
   \]

3. After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 1200 - 480 = 720

"First, let's determine how much Karen earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many hours Karen works in two days. If she works 3 hours per day, then in two days she works:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate Karen's earnings for those 6 hours:

\[ 20 \times 6 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Karen earns \(\boxed{120}\) dollars in two days."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple proportion based on the given information.

If 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, then the ratio of potatoes to hash browns is 6:36, which simplifies to 1:6. This means that for every potato, you can make 6 hash browns.

Now, if you have 96 potatoes, you can calculate the number of hash browns as follows:

\[ \text{Number of hash browns} = 96 \times 6 = 576 \]

So, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes."
"To find out by how much the group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we first need to calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults.

1. The weight of one adult is 80 kg.
2. The total weight of 8 adults is \(80 \, \text{kg/adult} \times 8 \, \text{adults} = 640 \, \text{kg}\).
3. Adding Jack's weight to the total, we get \(640 \, \text{kg} + 80 \, \text{kg} = 720 \, \text{kg}\).

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. Therefore, the excess weight is:

\(720 \, \text{kg} - 700 \, \text{kg} = 20 \, \text{kg}\).

They will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"Given that Katarina has 68 cookies, we can work backwards to find out how many cookies Max and the Cookie Monster have.

1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has \(68 + 5 = 73\) cookies.
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has \(73 - 12 = 61\) cookies.
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has \(73 + 23 = 96\) cookies.

Now, to find the total number of cookies they have, we add up the cookies each person has:

\[68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298\]

Therefore, they have a total of 298 cookies."
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the extension is \( 0.5x \) cm. Additionally, she adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom. Therefore, the total length of the dress after these modifications is:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 \]

We know that the final length of the dress is 140 cm. So, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, we divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]

\[ x = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

Final answer: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's find the mowing rates for both modes:
- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour, which is 60 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""turtle"" mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} \).
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""rabbit"" mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} \).

Now, we calculate the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode:
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes} \).
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes} \).

Finally, we add the times together to find the total time it took Chris to mow the entire lawn:
- Total time = 30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes.

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn."
"John and Jack have 30 minutes in total to walk to school. They have already spent 6 minutes to get to the corner and another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. 

First, we add the time spent so far:
6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

Now, we subtract the time already spent from the total time they have:
30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes

So, they have 11 minutes longer to get to school without being late."

$4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14

Therefore, Catherine pays a total of $14."
"Greta bakes 30 cookies. Celinda bakes twice as many, which means Celinda bakes \(30 \times 2 = 60\) cookies.

Together, they have \(30 + 60 = 90\) cookies.

They eat 10 of the cookies, so the number of cookies left is \(90 - 10 = 80\).

Therefore, there are 80 cookies in the box."
"Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as \( x \). Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of this twin would be \( x + 7 \).

The other triplet and the other twin would be the same age as the younger triplet and the younger twin, respectively, because they are part of a set of twins and a set of triplets. Therefore, the age of the other triplet is also \( x \), and the age of the other twin is \( x + 7 \).

The combined ages of all four individuals are given as 44. So, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 7) + x + (x + 7) = 44 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 4x + 14 = 44 \]

Subtract 14 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 7.5 \]

So, the age of the younger triplet is 7.5 years. The age of one of the twins, who is 7 years older than the younger triplet, is:

\[ x + 7 = 7.5 + 7 = 14.5 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is 14.5 years old."
"To determine how many minutes John has to nap, we first need to calculate the total time he spends on his homework.

John's homework times are:
- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Adding these times together:
20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Converting 3 hours into minutes:
3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner to find out how many minutes John has to nap:
180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that each lollipop costs $0.40. Manolo bought five lollipops, so the cost for the lollipops is:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

Next, we know that the total cost for four candies and the five lollipops is $3.20. We already calculated that the lollipops cost $2.00, so the cost for the four candies is:
\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

Now, we can find the cost of one candy by dividing the total cost of the candies by the number of candies:
\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

So, each candy costs $0.30. Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost for 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost for 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many coins Rong saves per month and then how many Neil saves per month.

Rong saves 20 coins per month.

Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong, so we calculate Neil's monthly savings as follows:
\[ \text{Neil's monthly savings} = 20 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \right) \]
\[ \text{Neil's monthly savings} = 20 + 8 = 28 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of coins saved by both Rong and Neil over ten years.

There are 12 months in a year, so over ten years, there are:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong's total savings over ten years:
\[ 20 \times 120 = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings over ten years:
\[ 28 \times 120 = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding both totals together gives us the combined total:
\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

Therefore, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:
5760"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and the dog needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:

\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Let the total bill be \( x \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:

\[ 0.60x \]

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:

\[ x = 40 + 0.60x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. Subtract \( 0.60x \) from both sides:

\[ x - 0.60x = 40 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 0.40x = 40 \]

Now, divide both sides by 0.40:

\[ x = \frac{40}{0.40} = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:

\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, John leaves with $25."
"To find the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - Therefore, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = \$1.0\).
   - There are 5 bananas in a crate.
   - The total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = \$5.0\).

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in a crate.
   - The total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = \$6.0\).

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - Oranges cost three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1.0.
   - Therefore, one orange costs \(3 \times 1.0 = \$3.0\).
   - There are 7 oranges in a crate.
   - The total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = \$21.0\).

4. **Total Cost of the Crate:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges.
   - Total cost = Cost of bananas + Cost of apples + Cost of oranges
   - Total cost = \$5.0 + \$6.0 + \$21.0 = \$32.0

The price for such a crate of fruit is \(\$32.0\)."
"To determine the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter, we need to calculate the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares**: The problem states there are 14 red squares.
   \[
   \text{Red squares} = 14
   \]

2. **Blue Squares**: There are 4 more blue squares than red squares.
   \[
   \text{Blue squares} = 14 + 4 = 18
   \]

3. **Green Squares**: There are 6 more green squares than blue squares.
   \[
   \text{Green squares} = 18 + 6 = 24
   \]

4. **White Squares**: There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares.
   \[
   \text{White squares} = 24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares in the comforter:
\[
\text{Total squares} = \text{Red squares} + \text{Blue squares} + \text{Green squares} + \text{White squares}
\]
\[
\text{Total squares} = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

"To determine the number of great-grandbabies at the family reunion, we can break down the family structure step by step.

1. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.
2. Each of her children has 3 children of their own, so the number of grandchildren is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).
3. Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies of their own, so the number of great-grandbabies is \(9 \times 3 = 27\).

Therefore, the number of great-grandbabies at the family reunion is 27."
"First, let's calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400 paycheck into her retirement account:

\[ 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

So, she puts $1200 into her retirement account.

Next, we calculate how much she uses for her monthly car payment. She uses 20% of her $2400 paycheck for her car payment:

\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

So, she uses $480 for her car payment.

Now, we subtract the amounts she has spent from her total paycheck to find out how much she has left to spend:

\[ 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Therefore, Greta has $720 left to spend."

"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person saves a seat and buys enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats. Since each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks, and there are 20 people, the group will buy:

- \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) drinks
- \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) snacks

Each drink and snack costs $2, so the total cost for the drinks is:

\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

And the total cost for the snacks is:

\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount spent on drinks and snacks:

\[ 80 + 120 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the group has spent a total of:

\[ \boxed{200} \] dollars on snacks and drinks."
"Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so:
\[ 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 \text{ pounds} \]

When Gary's truck joins, the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel. So, the amount Gary's truck can haul is:
\[ 11,600 - (4,000 + 4,800) = 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 \text{ pounds} \]

Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Number of Females and Males:**
   - There are 6 females.
   - There are 8 males, including Larry.

2. **Dumplings Eaten by Females:**
   - Each female ate 3 dumplings.
   - Total dumplings eaten by females = 6 females * 3 dumplings/female = 18 dumplings.

3. **Dumplings Eaten by Males:**
   - Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female.
   - Therefore, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.
   - Total dumplings eaten by males = 8 males * 4 dumplings/male = 32 dumplings.

4. **Total Dumplings Cooked:**
   - Total dumplings = Dumplings eaten by females + Dumplings eaten by males
   - Total dumplings = 18 dumplings + 32 dumplings = 50 dumplings.

Therefore, Larry cooked a total of 50 dumplings."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much money Gerald and Julia each received when they divided $100 in the ratio 3:2.

The total parts of the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Each part is worth $100 / 5 = $20.

Since Gerald's share is 3 parts, he received 3 * $20 = $60.

If Gerald spent $10 on a book, the amount of money he has left is $60 - $10 = $50.

Therefore, Gerald has $50 left."
"First, we need to determine the speed of Martha's turtle. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and the cat can run at 15 feet/second, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we need to calculate how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We do this by multiplying the turtle's speed by the time.

\[ \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find out how many more hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first need to determine how much more money they need to raise. 

The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount they need to raise is:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money they raise per hour. They raised $2100 in the first 3 hours, so the amount raised per hour is:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Now, to find out how many more hours they need to fundraise to raise the remaining $4200, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

So, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours. 

Therefore, the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal is:

\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]

**Final Answer: 9**"
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract the industrial usage from the total city usage to find the non-industrial usage.

Step 1: The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. So, the industrial usage is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 \text{ or } 32\% \]

Step 2: Subtract the industrial usage from the total city usage to find the non-industrial usage:
\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

Therefore, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

8%"
"To find out how much Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days in 2 weeks.
2. Multiply the number of days by the daily rate.

Step 1: There are 7 days in a week, so in 2 weeks, there are \(7 \times 2 = 14\) days.

Step 2: Alex charges $12 per day, so for 14 days, the total charge is \(12 \times 14 = 168\).

Therefore, Alex charges $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring."
"To determine the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we first need to calculate the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream.

For chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Next, we calculate the total production in 48 hours for each type of ice cream.

For chocolate ice cream in 48 hours:
- \( 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).

For vanilla ice cream in 48 hours:
- \( 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Finally, we add the total production of both types of ice cream to get the total production in 48 hours:
- \( 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \).

Therefore, the total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 3000 quarts."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Marcus ordered:

- Croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each = 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each = 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 muffins at $1.00 each = 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost before the discount:

Total cost = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off, we need to calculate 10% of $50.00 and subtract it from the total:

10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Subtract the discount from the total cost:

Total bill after discount = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is $45.00."
"Erin has $6.00 and each scoop of ice cream costs $1.50. With the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. 

First, let's calculate how many scoops she can buy with her $6.00 without considering the deal:
\[ \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

Now, let's see how the deal works with these 4 scoops. For every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. So, with 4 scoops, she can get 2 scoops free (since 4 divided by 2 is 2).

Therefore, the total number of scoops she will get is:
\[ 4 \text{ (bought)} + 2 \text{ (free)} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

So, Erin should buy 4 scoops to get a total of 6 scoops of ice cream."
"Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she will have eaten:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy eats 3 pieces of candy a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she will have eaten:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Both started with 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, Ginger will have:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

And Amy will have:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

To find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger after two weeks, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks."
"To find out how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the area that needs to be covered: two thirds of the 36 square feet bathroom.
2. Determine the number of tiles needed for that area, given that 24 tiles are required per square foot.

First, let's calculate the area to be covered:
\[ \text{Area to be covered} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \, \text{sq ft} = 24 \, \text{sq ft} \]

Next, we calculate the number of tiles needed for 24 square feet:

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 square foot bathroom."
"To determine how much James saved, we need to calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries and compare it to the cost of buying the same amount at the store.

1. **Cost of picking the blueberries:**
   - Initial cost to go picking: $20
   - Cost per pound: $1.5
   - Pounds of blueberries picked: 30

   Total cost for picking = Initial cost + (Cost per pound * Pounds picked)
   Total cost for picking = $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
   Total cost for picking = $20 + $45
   Total cost for picking = $65

2. **Cost of buying the blueberries at the store:**
   - Cost per pound at the store: $2.5
   - Pounds of blueberries: 30

   Total cost at the store = Cost per pound * Pounds
   Total cost at the store = $2.5 * 30
   Total cost at the store = $75

3. **Savings:**
   - Savings = Total cost at the store - Total cost for picking
   - Savings = $75 - $65
   - Savings = $10

James saved $10 compared to buying the blueberries at the store.

"First, let's calculate the new price of each computer after the 10% increase.

The original planned price per computer was $700. A 10% increase on $700 is calculated as follows:

\[ 700 \times 0.10 = 70 \]

So, the new price per computer is:

\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money the company paid to buy 500 computers at the new price, we multiply the new price per computer by the number of computers:

\[ 770 \times 500 = 385,000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:

\[ 385,000 \]"
"To calculate the total calories in John's omelet, we need to consider the calories from each component:

1. **Eggs**: John uses 6 eggs. Each egg is 75 calories.
   - Total calories from eggs = 6 eggs * 75 calories/egg = 450 calories

2. **Cheese**: John uses 2 oz of cheese. Each ounce of cheese is 120 calories.
   - Total calories from cheese = 2 oz * 120 calories/oz = 240 calories

3. **Ham**: John uses an equal amount of ham as cheese, which is 2 oz. Each ounce of ham is 40 calories.
   - Total calories from ham = 2 oz * 40 calories/oz = 80 calories

Now, we add up the calories from all components to get the total calories in the omelet:
- Total calories = Calories from eggs + Calories from cheese + Calories from ham
- Total calories = 450 calories + 240 calories + 80 calories = 770 calories

The omelet has a total of 770 calories."

"First, let's calculate the total number of pizzas ordered. Since there are 5 people (Bryce and his four friends) and each ordered one pizza, the total number of pizzas is 5.

Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends. Each of these three people ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizza. Therefore, the number of slices each of them ate is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \]
Since there are three of them, the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends is:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we calculate the number of slices eaten by the two remaining friends. Each of these two friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizza. Therefore, the number of slices each of them ate is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \]
Since there are two of them, the total number of slices eaten by the two remaining friends is:
\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

The total number of slices eaten by all five friends is:
\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \]

Finally, the number of slices left is the total number of slices minus the number of slices eaten:
\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \]

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"The cat eats nine sausages in 30 minutes.

The dog eats the same nine sausages in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes. So, the time the dog takes is:
\[ 30 \times \frac{2}{3} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the average time the two take to eat the sausages, we add the time the cat takes and the time the dog takes, and then divide by 2:
\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

The average time the two take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe into inches, and then use the given relationship to find the length of Bobby's shoe.

1. Convert the length of Topher's shoe to inches:
   - Topher's shoe length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches.
   - Since 1 foot = 12 inches, 8 feet = 8 * 12 = 96 inches.
   - Therefore, Topher's shoe length in inches is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

2. Use the given relationship to find the length of Bobby's shoe:
   - The length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe.
   - Let \( B \) be the length of Bobby's shoe in inches.
   - According to the problem, \( 100 = 9B + 10 \).

3. Solve for \( B \):
   - Subtract 10 from both sides: \( 100 - 10 = 9B \)
   - Simplify: \( 90 = 9B \)
   - Divide both sides by 9: \( B = \frac{90}{9} = 10 \)

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."
"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for both students' cars and teachers' cars separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each student's car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The number of students' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 64 = 16 \]

Since each of these 16 cars has 4 windows, the total number of windows smashed for the students' cars is:
\[ 16 \times 4 = 64 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teacher's car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows.

The number of teachers' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 32 = 24 \]

Since each of these 24 cars has 2 windows, the total number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars is:
\[ 24 \times 2 = 48 \]

Finally, we add the number of windows smashed for both students' cars and teachers' cars to get the total number of windows smashed:
\[ 64 + 48 = 112 \]

Therefore, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:
\[ \boxed{112} \]"
"To find the percentage of spools that are blue, we first need to determine the total number of spools and the number of blue spools.

Candy has:
- 15 light blue spools
- 45 dark blue spools
- 40 light green spools
- 50 dark green spools

The total number of spools is:
15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 spools

The number of blue spools is:
15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60 blue spools

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\% \]

Therefore, 40% of her spools are blue."
"At 8:00, there were 5000 people in line to vote.

By midday (12:00), 2/5 of the people had voted. So, the number of people who had voted by midday is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \]

The number of people remaining in line by midday is:
\[ 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \]

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. So, the number of people who had voted by 16:00 from the remaining 3000 is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \]

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:
\[ 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."

1. **Calculate the total number of smores needed:**
   - **Kids:** 9 kids want 2 smores each, so \(9 \times 2 = 18\) smores.
   - **Adults:** 6 adults will eat 1 smore each, so \(6 \times 1 = 6\) smores.
   - **Total smores needed:** \(18 + 6 = 24\) smores.

2. **Determine how many smores can be made from one box of graham crackers:**
   - Each sleeve makes 8 smores.
   - There are 3 sleeves in a box, so \(3 \times 8 = 24\) smores per box.

3. **Calculate the number of boxes needed:**
   - Since one box can make 24 smores and we need 24 smores, we need \( \frac{24}{24} = 1 \) box.

Therefore, they will need **1 box** of graham crackers."
"Given that Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate the ages of her father and mother as follows:

1. Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we calculate her father's age as:
\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

2. Dora's mother is four years younger than her father. So, we calculate her mother's age as:
\[ \text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Now, we add the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother to find the total combined age:
\[ \text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

Therefore, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87."
"To solve this problem, we need to divide the total amount of money Greg found by the number of people who will share it, including Greg himself and his 3 younger siblings. This means there are a total of 4 people.

The total amount of money is $20, and it needs to be split equally among 4 people.

\[ \text{Amount each person gets} = \frac{\text{Total amount of money}}{\text{Number of people}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

"Cindy's math and science books each weigh 2 pounds, so together they weigh:
2 pounds + 2 pounds = 4 pounds

Her French book weighs 4 pounds.

Her English book weighs 3 pounds.

Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book, so it weighs:
2 * 3 pounds = 6 pounds

Now, we add up the weights of all her books:
Math and science books: 4 pounds
French book: 4 pounds
English book: 3 pounds
History book: 6 pounds

Total weight = 4 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17 pounds

The total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds."
"Candidate A got 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, we can calculate the number of votes for candidate A as follows:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate A} = 20\% \times 100 = 20 \]

Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. Therefore, we calculate the number of votes for candidate B as follows:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + (50\% \times 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

The total number of votes is 100. The votes for candidate C can be found by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (\text{Votes for candidate A} + \text{Votes for candidate B}) = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Therefore, candidate C got 50 votes."
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, Beck has:

\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \text{ apples} \]

Next, if Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Boris will have:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \text{ apples} \]

And Beck will have:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \text{ apples} \]

Now, to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this exchange, we subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris.

"To determine how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract that from the initial 32 ounces.

1. **Giant Cubes:**
   - Each giant cube uses 4 ounces.
   - Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   - Total water used for giant cubes: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) ounces.

2. **Medium Cubes:**
   - Each medium cube uses 2 ounces.
   - Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   - Total water used for medium cubes: \(7 \times 2 = 14\) ounces.

3. **Small Cubes:**
   - Each small cube uses 1/2 ounce.
   - Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   - Total water used for small cubes: \(8 \times \frac{1}{2} = 4\) ounces.

Now, we add up the total water used for all the cubes:
\[12 \text{ ounces (giant cubes)} + 14 \text{ ounces (medium cubes)} + 4 \text{ ounces (small cubes)} = 30 \text{ ounces}\]

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial 32 ounces:

"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

1. **Weekday Rentals:**
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays.
   - Since 60 chairs are rented each weekday, the total number of chairs rented during weekdays in one 4-week month is \(60 \times 20 = 1200\) chairs.

2. **Weekend Rentals:**
   - There are 2 weekend days in a week.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.
   - Since 100 chairs are rented each weekend day, the total number of chairs rented during weekends in one 4-week month is \(100 \times 8 = 800\) chairs.

3. **Total Rentals in One 4-Week Month:**
   - The total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month is the sum of weekday and weekend rentals, which is \(1200 + 800 = 2000\) chairs.

4. **Total Rentals in Two 4-Week Months:**

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers and Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.
   - A small sticker is worth one small button.
   - A large button is worth three small stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.
   - Each small button can be exchanged for a large button, so 27 small buttons = 27 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left and 40 + 27 = 67 large stickers.

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 67 large stickers = 0.5 * 67 = 33.5. Since we can't have half a sticker, we'll assume she trades 33 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button, so 33 large stickers = 33 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 67 - 33 = 34 large stickers left and 67 + 33 = 100 large buttons.

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 34 large stickers left.
   - Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so 34 large stickers = 34 * 3 = 102 small buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 102 small buttons.

5. **Total Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 102 small buttons and 100 large buttons.

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3.5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 3.5:
\[ x = \frac{250}{3.5} = \frac{2500}{35} = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases of shingles, so:

"To make 1 liter of juice, Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges. Therefore, to make 4 liters of juice, Sam would need:

\[ 5 \, \text{kg/liter} \times 4 \, \text{liters} = 20 \, \text{kg} \]

Each kilogram of oranges costs $3. So, for 20 kilograms of oranges, the cost would be:

\[ 20 \, \text{kg} \times \$3/\text{kg} = \$60 \]

Sam would have to spend \(\boxed{60}\) dollars to make 4 liters of juice."
"Ezra read 300 books in one hour and decided to read 150 more. So, the total number of books Ezra read is:

300 + 150 = 450 books

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour, Ahmed read half the number of books Ezra read in that hour:

300 / 2 = 150 books

Together, they have read:

450 (Ezra's total) + 150 (Ahmed's total) = 600 books

They have read a total of 600 books altogether."
"To calculate Tanya's earnings for the two days, we need to break down her earnings for each day and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour, so for 5 hours, she earns \(5 \times 15 = 75\) dollars.
- Since she taught more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5, making her total for Monday \(75 + 5 = 80\) dollars.

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour, so for 2 hours, she earns \(2 \times 15 = 30\) dollars.
- Since she did not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5.

Now, we sum up her earnings for both days:
- Monday: $80
- Wednesday: $30

Total earnings: \(80 + 30 = 110\) dollars.

**Final numerical answer:**
110"
"To determine how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents, we need to calculate the total sales for each type of scent and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total sales for vanilla scents:
- They sell 5 of each of the 4 vanilla scents.
- Total vanilla scents sold = 5 * 4 = 20

Next, let's calculate the total sales for fruity scents:
- They sell 2 of each of the 8 fruity scents.
- Total fruity scents sold = 2 * 8 = 16

Now, we find the difference in the number of scents sold:
- Difference = Vanilla scents sold - Fruity scents sold
- Difference = 20 - 16 = 4

Therefore, 4 more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents."
"First, let's calculate how much money Bennet makes from selling the eggplants.

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

So, Bennet makes $60 from the eggplants.

Next, we need to determine how much more money Bennet needs to make to reach his goal of $135:
\[ 135 - 60 = 75 \]

Bennet needs to make $75 from selling the 25 ears of corn. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the total amount he needs by the number of ears of corn:
\[ \frac{75}{25} = 3 \]

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of time Tatiana has for her weekend activities:

Total time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Next, we subtract the time she spends reading:

Time left after reading = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

Now, she plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time:

Time spent on video games = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

So, the time left for playing soccer is:

Time for soccer = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time for soccer}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{12 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

Therefore, Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer."
"Anthony initially had 50 pencils.

First, he gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]
So, Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon, leaving him with:
\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \]

Next, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15 \]
So, Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie, leaving him with:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils."
"To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time he spends driving to the museum, the time he spends driving back, and the time he spends at the museum.

1. **Time to the museum:**
   - Distance to the museum: 150 miles
   - Speed: 75 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

2. **Time back from the museum:**
   - The distance back is the same, 150 miles, and the speed is the same, 75 mph.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

3. **Time spent at the museum:**
   - Jack spends 6 hours at the museum.

Now, we add up all the times:
- Time to the museum: 2 hours
- Time at the museum: 6 hours
- Time back from the museum: 2 hours

Total time = 2 hours + 6 hours + 2 hours = 10 hours

Therefore, Jack is gone from home for 10 hours."
"To find out how many wheels Henry will need to assemble all the toys, we can calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles separately, and then sum them up.

For the cars:
- Henry needs 57 cars.
- Each car requires 4 wheels.
- Total wheels for cars = 57 cars * 4 wheels/car = 228 wheels.

For the motorcycles:
- Henry needs 73 motorcycles.
- Each motorcycle requires 2 wheels.
- Total wheels for motorcycles = 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels/motorcycle = 146 wheels.

Now, we add the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles to find the total number of wheels required:
- Total wheels required = 228 wheels (for cars) + 146 wheels (for motorcycles) = 374 wheels.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling all the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the number of wheels in the box:
- Wheels left = 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels.

Therefore, the number of wheels that will be left is 276."
"To calculate the price after a 20% discount, you first find 20% of $1000 and then subtract that from the original price.

20% of $1000 is calculated as:
\[ 1000 \times \frac{20}{100} = 1000 \times 0.20 = 200 \]

Subtract the discount from the original price:
\[ 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

So, after a 20% discount, you have to pay $800."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Mike has a total of 600 movies.
2. A third of these movies are in series, so the number of series movies is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \) movies.
3. The cost for series movies is $6 each, so the total cost for series movies is \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \) dollars.

4. The remaining movies are \( 600 - 200 = 400 \) movies.
5. 40% of these remaining movies are older movies, so the number of older movies is \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \) movies.
6. The cost for older movies is $5 each, so the total cost for older movies is \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars.

7. The remaining movies are \( 400 - 160 = 240 \) movies, and these are normal movies.
8. The cost for normal movies is $10 each, so the total cost for normal movies is \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \) dollars.

9. The total cost to replace the movies is the sum of the costs for series movies, older movies, and normal movies:
   \[
   1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400
   \]

Therefore, the total cost to replace the movies is $4400."

Therefore, Winston spent \(\$38.00\) on fruit."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the Llesis family, which is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked.

1. **Calculate the distance driven:**
   - They drove for 4.5 hours (since the total time was 6 hours and they hiked for 1.5 hours).
   - Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour.
   - Distance driven = Speed * Time = 50 miles/hour * 4.5 hours = 225 miles.

2. **Calculate the hiking speed:**
   - Their hiking speed was 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
   - Half of their driving speed = 50 miles/hour / 2 = 25 miles/hour.
   - Hiking speed = 25 miles/hour - 5 miles/hour = 20 miles/hour.

3. **Calculate the distance hiked:**
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours.
   - Distance hiked = Speed * Time = 20 miles/hour * 1.5 hours = 30 miles.

4. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked = 225 miles + 30 miles = 255 miles.

The total distance to their vacation spot is 255 miles."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( E_e \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( A_e \) be the number of enemies Ava jumps on.
- Let \( E_b \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( A_b \ be the number of berries Ava collects.
- Let \( E_t \) be the time left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.
- Let \( A_t \) be the time left on the timer when Ava finishes the level.

From the problem, we know:
- \( A_e = E_e + 8 \)
- \( A_b = E_b + 3 \)
- \( A_t = E_t + 4 \)

The points are calculated as follows:
- Points for enemies: \( 10 \times \text{number of enemies} \)
- Points for berries: \( 5 \times \text{number of berries} \)
- Points for time: \( 30 \times \text{time left on the timer} \)

So, the total score for Emma is:
\[ \text{Score}_E = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \]

And the total score for Ava is:
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10A_e + 5A_b + 30A_t \]

Substituting the values of \( A_e \), \( A_b \), and \( A_t \) in terms of \( E_e \), \( E_b \), and \( E_t \):
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(E_b + 3) + 30(E_t + 4) \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120 \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215 \]

Now, we can find the difference between their scores:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Score}_A - \text{Score}_E \]
\[ \text{Difference} = (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215) - (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 215 \]

So, the difference between their two scores is:
\[ \boxed{215} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The total cost of the four pizzas is $64.
2. Two of the pizzas cost $30 in total.
3. We need to find the cost of each of the other two pizzas, which cost the same amount.

First, we calculate the total cost of the other two pizzas:
\[ \text{Total cost of four pizzas} - \text{Total cost of two pizzas} = \text{Total cost of other two pizzas} \]
\[ 64 - 30 = 34 \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of these two pizzas by 2:
\[ \text{Cost of each of the other two pizzas} = \frac{34}{2} = 17 \]

So, each of the other two pizzas cost $17.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 17 \]"

3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides

On the two other days, they ride twice the times they do on the usual days, so:

2 rides/day * 2 days = 4 rides

Adding these together gives the total number of rides in a week:

15 rides + 4 rides = 19 rides

They ride their bikes 19 times a week."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond: 3 orange and 4 white.
2. He bought 17 more fish from the pet store, and after adding them, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote:
- \( O \) as the number of orange fish Bob bought.
- \( W \) as the number of white fish Bob bought.

After buying the fish, the total number of orange fish in the pond is \( 3 + O \), and the total number of white fish is \( 4 + W \).

According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This can be expressed as:
\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

We also know that the total number of fish he bought is 17:
\[ O + W = 17 \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:
1. \( 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

First, simplify the first equation:
\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]
\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

Now we have:
1. \( O - 2W = 5 \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

We can solve these equations simultaneously. From the second equation, express \( O \) in terms of \( W \):
\[ O = 17 - W \]

Substitute this into the first equation:
\[ 17 - W - 2W = 5 \]
\[ 17 - 3W = 5 \]
\[ -3W = 5 - 17 \]
\[ -3W = -12 \]
\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Andy travels to work in a week.
2. Determine the amount of fuel used for this distance.
3. Calculate the cost of the fuel used.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance traveled in a week.**

Andy travels 5 miles one way to work. Therefore, the round trip distance is:
\[ 5 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

Since he works from Monday to Friday, the total distance for the week is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ miles} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount of fuel used.**

Andy's car has a fuel efficiency of 10 miles per gallon. Therefore, the amount of fuel used for 50 miles is:
\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the fuel used.**

The price of regular gas is $3 per gallon. Therefore, the cost of 5 gallons of gas is:
\[ 5 \text{ gallons} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received from her aunt.

Carrie was given ten twenties, which is:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

She was also given 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount from the quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Carrie received is:
\[ 200 + 35 = 235 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she spent. She spent 3/5 of the twenties and all the quarters.

The amount spent on the twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount spent on the quarters is:
\[ 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money she paid for the lunch is:
\[ 120 + 35 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

Final answer:
\[ 155 \]"
"To find out how many fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo has 5 tomato plants.
- Therefore, the total number of tomatoes is \(22 \times 5 = 110\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants.
- Therefore, the total number of eggplants is \(4 \times 8 = 32\).

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:
- Total number of fruits = Total number of tomatoes + Total number of eggplants
- Total number of fruits = \(110 + 32 = 142\).

Therefore, Ricardo can get 142 fruits from his plants."

"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total cost of the trip.
2. Calculate the amount the school will cover.
3. Calculate the amount John still needs to raise.

The total cost of the trip is $300. The school will cover half of this cost, so the school will contribute:
\[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

This means John needs to raise the other half of the cost, which is also $150. John currently has $50, so the amount he still needs to raise is:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the amount of money John is missing is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, we need to determine the temperature during the night. If it's 33 degrees colder at night compared to the day, and the day temperature was 45 degrees, then the night temperature would be:

\[ 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, we need to find out how much the temperature needs to be raised to prevent the pipes from freezing. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. So, we need to raise the temperature from 12 degrees to 32 degrees:

\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Since each log of wood burns raises the temperature by 5 degrees, we need to calculate how many logs are required to raise the temperature by 20 degrees:

\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing."
"First, we need to determine the number of 9-person groups that can be formed from 90 people. This is calculated by dividing the total number of people by the group size:

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups are part of the 3/5 of the total groups. This is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Number of groups bringing seashells} = \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]

Each of these 6 groups brings back 2 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is:

\[ \text{Total seashells} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the changes in the number of people on the train step by step.

1. Initially, there are 172 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 47 people get off, so we subtract 47 from 172:
   \[
   172 - 47 = 125
   \]
3. Then, 13 more people get on the train, so we add 13 to 125:
   \[
   125 + 13 = 138
   \]
4. At the next stop, 38 people get off, so we subtract 38 from 138:

Therefore, the final number of people on the train is 100."
"To calculate how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many bottle caps Damien finds in a day.
2. Calculate the value of the bottle caps he finds in a day.
3. Multiply the daily value by the number of days in the month.

Step 1: Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day.

Step 2: Each bottle cap is worth $0.25, so the value of the bottle caps he finds in a day is:
\[ 10 \text{ bottle caps/day} \times \$0.25/\text{bottle cap} = \$2.50/\text{day} \]

Step 3: To find out how much money he makes in a 30-day month, we multiply the daily value by 30:
\[ \$2.50/\text{day} \times 30 \text{ days} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, Damien makes \(\$75.00\) in a 30-day month."
"Jamie's regular hourly rate is $20 per hour. For the additional hours worked beyond her regular 8-hour day, she is paid at a rate of 150% of her regular hourly rate.

First, calculate the special hourly rate for the additional hours:

"The zookeeper counts 12 female lions. There are half as many male lions, which means there are 12 / 2 = 6 male lions. Additionally, there are 14 lion cubs.

To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and cubs together:

12 (female lions) + 6 (male lions) + 14 (cubs) = 32 lions

So, there are 32 lions in the enclosure."
"First, we need to calculate the discount on the jeans. The original price of the jeans is $40, and they are advertised at 25% off.

To find the discount amount, we calculate 25% of $40:
\[ 25\% \times 40 = 0.25 \times 40 = 10 \]

So, the discount is $10. Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

The sale price of the jeans is $30. Mike pays with a $50 bill, so we subtract the cost of the jeans from the $50 bill to find out how much money Mike will have left over:
\[ 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Mike will have left over is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"The company hires 20 new employees every month. Over three months, the total number of new hires is:

20 employees/month * 3 months = 60 new employees

The initial workforce is 200 employees, and with the addition of 60 new employees, the total workforce after three months is:

200 initial employees + 60 new employees = 260 employees

Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month. Therefore, the total monthly payroll for 260 employees is:

260 employees * $4000/employee = $1,040,000

To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we multiply the monthly payroll by 3:

First, let's calculate the cost of 3 loaves of bread:
- Each loaf of bread costs $2.
- Therefore, 3 loaves of bread cost \(3 \times 2 = 6\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of 2 bagels:
- Each bagel costs $1.
- Therefore, 2 bagels cost \(2 \times 1 = 2\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference between the cost of 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels:
- The difference is \(6 - 2 = 4\) dollars.

So, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels."
"First, let's calculate how many points Nikita scored. We know that Nikita scored 11 more than half as many points as Pierson. Pierson scored 278 points.

Half of Pierson's points is:
\[ \frac{278}{2} = 139 \]

Nikita scored 11 more than this amount:
\[ 139 + 11 = 150 \]

Now, to find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we add their scores together:
\[ 278 + 150 = 428 \]

Therefore, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is:
428"
"To calculate the total number of trees planted, we need to consider both the students and the teachers' contributions.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students:
- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has 25 students.
- Therefore, the total number of students is \(40 \times 25 = 1000\).
- Each student plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by students is \(1000 \times 1 = 1000\).

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has 3 teachers.
- Therefore, the total number of teachers is \(40 \times 3 = 120\).
- Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by teachers is \(120 \times 2 = 240\).

Finally, we add the number of trees planted by students and teachers to get the total number of trees planted:
- Total trees = Trees planted by students + Trees planted by teachers
- Total trees = \(1000 + 240 = 1240\).

Therefore, at the end of the campaign, they will have planted 1240 trees."
"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 stuffed animals

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy as \( x \). After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

Final numerical answer:

"Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, so:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \text{ hour/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:

\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the hours from both periods:

\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. To find out how many more hours she needs to play:

\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. The first car travels at 60 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it will travel:
   \[
   60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. The second car travels at 70 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it will travel:
   \[
   70 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 140 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. The difference in distance between the second car and the first car after 2 hours is:
   \[
   140 \text{ miles} - 120 \text{ miles} = 20 \text{ miles}
   \]

So, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car."
"To find out how much James paid for the ring, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the materials (diamond and gold).
2. Calculate the 30% premium on the total cost of the materials.
3. Add the premium to the total cost of the materials to get the final amount James paid.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the materials.
The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300.
Total cost of materials = $600 + $300 = $900

Step 2: Calculate the 30% premium.
30% of $900 = 0.30 * $900 = $270

Step 3: Add the premium to the total cost of the materials.
Final amount paid = Total cost of materials + Premium
Final amount paid = $900 + $270 = $1170

Therefore, James paid $1170 for the ring."
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students, then divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students.

First, let's calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders, so it's \(2 \times \frac{40}{100} = \frac{80}{100} = 0.8\). Therefore, 400 fifth-graders had \(400 \times 0.8 = 320\) pass.

Now, let's sum up the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total students who passed: \(340 + 40 + 320 = 680\)
- Total students: \(500 + 100 + 400 = 1000\)

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students:

\[
\text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{680}{1000} = 0.68
\]

Expressing this as a percentage:

\[
0.68 \times 100 = 68\%
\]

Therefore, the school's overall pass rate is 68%."
"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of the mosaic he can make with the total number of chips.
3. Calculate the length of the mosaic given its height.

First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has in total. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, we multiply:

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12:

\[ 144 \text{ chips} \div 12 \text{ chips/square inch} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Now, we know the mosaic will be 3 inches tall. To find the length of the mosaic, we divide the total area by the height:

\[ 12 \text{ square inches} \div 3 \text{ inches} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of the mosaic Milo can make is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find out how many gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party, we need to first calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students and then add the remaining tea to find the initial amount.

1. Calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the four students:
   - Each of the four students drank 1.5 quarts.
   - Total for four students: \(4 \times 1.5 = 6\) quarts.

2. Calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the sixteen students:
   - Each of the sixteen students drank 2 quarts.
   - Total for sixteen students: \(16 \times 2 = 32\) quarts.

3. Calculate the total amount of tea consumed by all the students:
   - Total consumed: \(6 + 32 = 38\) quarts.

4. Add the remaining tea to the total consumed to find the initial amount:
   - Remaining tea: 10 quarts.
   - Initial amount: \(38 + 10 = 48\) quarts.

5. Convert the initial amount from quarts to gallons (since there are 4 quarts in a gallon):
   - Initial amount in gallons: \(48 \div 4 = 12\) gallons.

Final numerical answer:
12 gallons"
"Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 butterscotch candies, which means he needed to order more to meet the demand. He then ordered an additional 100 candies. 

To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and then subtract the number of candies he has already sold.

Total candies = Initial candies + Additional candies ordered
Total candies = 100 + 100 = 200

Candies sold = 150

Candies still to be sold = Total candies - Candies sold
Candies still to be sold = 200 - 150 = 50

Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month, starting from the beginning of the year, and then find the difference between the number of students at the end of May and the initial number of students.

1. **Beginning of the year (January):** 10 students
2. **End of January:** The number of students doubles, so \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
3. **End of February:** The number of students doubles again, so \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
4. **End of March:** The number of students doubles again, so \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
5. **End of April:** The number of students doubles again, so \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
6. **End of May:** The number of students doubles again, so \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

Now, we need to find the additional students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year.

The number of students at the beginning of the year is 10, and at the end of May, it is 320. The additional students are:

\[320 - 10 = 310\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

310"
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. During the week, he made $105. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = 420 \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches climbed per day:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = 60 \]

Therefore, on average, Felix climbed 60 branches per day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picked:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\]

Next, we account for the flowers that are dropped. She drops 1 of each type of flower, so she drops:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\]

Subtracting the petals of the dropped flowers from the initial total gives:
\[101 - 22 = 79\]

So, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:
\[79\]"
"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they make:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ S'mores} \]

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they used 18 marshmallows to make these S'mores. Additionally, they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. So, the total number of marshmallows that are no longer available is:

\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ marshmallows} \]

The bag originally had 35 marshmallows. After using and dropping some, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is:

\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Since John and DeSean are sharing the remaining marshmallows equally, each of them can have:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Therefore, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

"Let's denote the amount of citrus zest used as \( z \) ounces. Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.

The amount of salt used is \( s \) ounces. According to the problem, the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, so the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.

The amount of oil used is \( 2s \) ounces, as it is twice the amount of salt.

The total amount of ingredients used is the sum of the amounts of salt, oil, fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar. This total is equal to 10 ounces, the capacity of the jar. So we can write the equation:

\[ s + 2s + z + z + s = 10 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 4s + 2z = 10 \]

We know that \( z = s \), so we can substitute \( z \) with \( s \):

\[ 4s + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 6s = 10 \]
\[ s = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Now, the amount of oil used is \( 2s \):

\[ 2s = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

So, the amount of oil used is \(\frac{10}{3}\) ounces.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{10}{3}}

"To find out how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows, then add these two amounts together.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John bought 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John bought 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the total amount of money John spent:
- Total cost of goats: $1500
- Total cost of cows: $3000
- Therefore, the total amount of money John spent is \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:

63 (total needed) - 48 (already has) = 15

Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"First, let's determine how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. So, the number of cars he gives away is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of cars Joe has sold and given away:

\[ 8 + 16 = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Finally, to find out how many cars Joe remains with, we subtract the total number of cars sold and given away from the initial number of cars Joe had:

\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Joe remains with 16 cars after selling and giving some to his mother."
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount raised by the students.
2. Divide this amount by the number of students.

First, we know the total amount raised for the charity is $175,000. Out of this, $50,000 comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to divide this amount by the number of students, which is 20:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\)."
"Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as many hours, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we add the hours from both days together: 8 + 4 = 12 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total hours into minutes: 12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes.

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars entered, making the total:

Therefore, the total number of cars left in the parking lot during lunch break is:

70 - 35 = 35 cars

The total number of cars he counted during lunch break is 35."
"To calculate how much John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tasks John does in a day.
2. Calculate the total number of tasks John does in a week.
3. Calculate the total earnings based on the number of tasks and the pay per task.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of tasks per day.
John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 tasks.
So, the total number of tasks per day is \(30 \times 5 = 150\).

Step 2: Calculate the total number of tasks per week.
Since John works 7 days a week, the total number of tasks per week is \(150 \times 7 = 1050\).

Step 3: Calculate the total earnings.
Each task pays $1.20, so the total earnings for the week are \(1050 \times 1.20 = 1260\).

Therefore, John makes \(\boxed{1260}\) dollars in a full 7-day week."
"In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her scores from each game: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

Total points Sasha scored during both games: 18."

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have:
\[ \text{Smendrick's cards} = 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \]
\[ \text{Becca's cards} = 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards."
"To find out how many eggs Cindy had altogether, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.
3. She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs:
- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

Total number of eggs = \(5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27\)

Therefore, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the refund she will receive and the cost of shipping the book back. Then, we'll subtract the refund from the original cost of the book to find the net loss.

1. **Calculate the refund:**
   - The book's purchase price is $32.
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price.
   - Refund = 75% of $32 = 0.75 * $32 = $24.

2. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds.
   - The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
   - Shipping cost for weight = 4 pounds * $0.35 per pound = $1.40.
   - The book needs to be returned 20 miles away.
   - The shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
   - Shipping cost for distance = 20 miles * $0.08 per mile = $1.60.
   - Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - Original cost of the book = $32.
   - Refund = $24.
   - Net loss = Original cost - Refund - Shipping cost = $32 - $24 - $3 = $5.

Milly will lose $5."
"Mulan starts with $40 and her father gives her an additional $100, so she has:

$40 + $100 = $140

She then buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, which costs:

2 * $30 = $60

And she buys a bag for $20. So the total cost of her purchases is:

$60 + $20 = $80

Subtracting the total cost of her purchases from her total money gives:

$140 - $80 = $60

Mulan has $60 left."
"Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. Let's break down the production for each week:

- First week: 8,000 bars
- Second week: Half of the first week, which is \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars
- Third week: Three times the first week, which is \( 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \) bars

Now, let's calculate the total production for the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars} \]

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, the production for the fourth week is:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars} \]

Therefore, the production for the fourth week is 14,000 bars."

   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - Weekly makeup time = 15 minutes/day * 6 days = 90 minutes.
   - Monthly makeup time = 90 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 360 minutes.

Now, we sum up all the time spent on these activities in a month:
- Total monthly time = Recording time + Writing time + Makeup time
- Total monthly time = 288 minutes + 480 minutes + 360 minutes = 1128 minutes.

Therefore, Britany spends 1128 minutes on TikTok in a month with four weeks."
"To calculate the total cost for Angela, we need to break down the charges based on the information provided.

1. **Base Installation Cost**: The base cost for hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures is $129.00.

2. **Additional Items**:
   - Angela needs 6 mirrors, but the base cost already includes 4 mirrors. So, she needs 2 additional mirrors.
   - Angela needs 2 chandeliers, but the base cost already includes 1 chandelier. So, she needs 1 additional chandelier.
   - Angela needs 20 pictures, but the base cost already includes 10 pictures. So, she needs 10 additional pictures.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - Additional mirrors: 2 mirrors * $15.00 per item = $30.00
   - Additional chandeliers: 1 chandelier * $15.00 per item = $15.00
   - Additional pictures: 10 pictures * $15.00 per item = $150.00

4. **Total Additional Cost**: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

5. **Total Cost**: Base installation cost + Total additional cost = $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00

**Final Answer**: $324.00"
"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Anthony has saved.
2. Use Anthony's savings to find out how much Roy has saved.

First, we know that Eva has saved $20.00. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so:

\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Next, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:

\[ 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \]

So, Roy's savings are:

\[ \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 12 = 30 + 12 = 42 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Roy has is:

\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to work through the relationships step by step.

1. **Pompei's lifting capacity**: Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.

2. **Saskay's lifting capacity**: Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain:
   \[
   12 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Kagiyami's lifting capacity**: Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain:
   \[
   4 \times 12 \text{ inches} = 48 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Naruto's lifting capacity**: Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain:
   \[
   10 \times 48 \text{ inches} = 480 \text{ inches}
   \]

5. **Convert inches to feet**: Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 480 inches to feet:
   \[
   \frac{480 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 40 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high."
"Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour. 

For the first part of his journey, he travels for 4 hours. The distance covered in this part is:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

After resting, he travels for another 6 hours. The distance covered in this part is:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the distances from both parts of his journey gives the total distance:
\[ 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for four turtles to travel the same distance that three kangaroos travel in 18 hours, given that each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo.

First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos. If three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel a certain distance, then the speed of the kangaroos can be represented as the distance divided by the time. Let's denote the distance as \(D\) and the speed of one kangaroo as \(S\). The total speed of the three kangaroos combined is \(3S\). Since they travel the distance \(D\) in 18 hours, we can write:

\[3S \times 18 = D\]

From this, we can solve for \(S\):

\[S = \frac{D}{54}\]

Now, we need to find the speed of the turtles. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is:

\[ \frac{S}{2} = \frac{D}{108} \]

Since we have four turtles, their combined speed is:

\[4 \times \frac{D}{108} = \frac{4D}{108} = \frac{D}{27}\]

Now, we need to find the time it takes for the four turtles to travel the distance \(D\). Using the formula \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \), we get:

\[ \text{time} = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{27}} = 27 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take the four turtles 27 hours to travel the same distance. 

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"Kora made 20 dishes.

Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora, so Rory makes:
20 (Kora's dishes) + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada makes:
2 * 40 (Rory's dishes) = 80 dishes.

Together, they make:
20 (Kora's dishes) + 40 (Rory's dishes) + 80 (Jada's dishes) = 140 dishes.

Final numerical answer:
140"
"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the reduced price of the laptop after the trade-in.
2. Determine the total amount of money Erika has, excluding the money in her purse.
3. Use the information that she still needs $50 to find out how much she has in her purse.

Step 1: The reduced price of the laptop after the trade-in is:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Step 2: The total amount of money Erika has, excluding the money in her purse, is the sum of the money she has been paid for her part-time job and the money her mom gave her:
\[ 150 + 80 = 230 \]

Step 3: Since Erika still needs $50 to buy the laptop, the amount of money she has in her purse is the difference between the reduced price of the laptop and the total amount of money she has (excluding her purse):
\[ 400 - 230 = 170 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:
\[ \boxed{170} \]"
"To determine how many apple slices are left, we first need to calculate the total number of slices Adam has after slicing the apples.

Adam slices 3 large apples, and each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces. Therefore, the total number of slices from the large apples is:
\[ 3 \text{ large apples} \times 5 \text{ slices per large apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Next, Adam slices 5 small apples, and each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces. Therefore, the total number of slices from the small apples is:
\[ 5 \text{ small apples} \times 3 \text{ slices per small apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Adding the slices from the large and small apples together, we get the total number of slices:
\[ 15 \text{ slices from large apples} + 15 \text{ slices from small apples} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam then eats 15 slices. To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the number of slices he ate from the total number of slices:
\[ 30 \text{ slices} - 15 \text{ slices eaten} = 15 \text{ slices left} \]

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is:
\[ 15 \]"
"The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk a day from one cow. Therefore, with 3 cows, he extracts:

\[ 5 \, \text{liters/cow} \times 3 \, \text{cows} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, he needs:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters a day, the number of additional cows needed is:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and then sum these lengths.

1. The first glue stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left, so \( \frac{5}{6} \) is not used. Since the original length of each glue stick is 12 millimeters, the unused length of the first glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left, so \( \frac{1}{3} \) is not used. The unused length of the second glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left, so \( \frac{1}{2} \) is not used. The unused length of the third glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we sum the unused lengths of all three glue sticks:
\[
10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \text{ millimeters}
\]

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:
20 millimeters"
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the car and the phone, and then subtract the amount of money he already has.

The total cost of the car and the phone is:
$10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800

Gabriel has:
$5000 (from working on weekends) + $200 (from his brother) = $5200

Now, we subtract the amount Gabriel has from the total cost:
$10800 (total cost) - $5200 (amount Gabriel has) = $5600

Gabriel still needs $5600."
"Thea gave the craftsman four $20 bills, which totals:

4 * $20 = $80

The hat cost $70, so the change Thea received is:

$80 - $70 = $10

Therefore, Thea got $10 in change."
"Craig starts with 2 twenty dollar bills, which amounts to:

2 * $20 = $40

He spends $2 on each of the six squirt guns, so the total spent on squirt guns is:

6 * $2 = $12

He also spends $3 on each of the three packs of water balloons, so the total spent on water balloons is:

3 * $3 = $9

The total amount spent is the sum of the money spent on squirt guns and water balloons:

$12 + $9 = $21

To find out how much money Craig has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money he had:

$40 - $21 = $19

Therefore, Craig has $19 left."
"Given:
- Jack collected 60 dishes.
- Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) socks.
- Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
- Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
- Jack's total: \( 30 \) socks + \( 60 \) dishes = \( 90 \)
- Peter's total: \( 60 \) socks + \( 30 \) dishes = \( 90 \)

Total number of socks and dishes together: \( 90 + 90 = 180 \)

Final numerical answer:

"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

- 5 students are good at math only.
- The rest of the students are good at both math and English. Since there are 20 students in total and 5 are good at math only, the number of students who are good at both subjects is \(20 - 5 - 8 = 7\).

So, the total number of students good at math is the sum of those good at math only and those good at both subjects:
\[5 + 7 = 12\]

Therefore, the number of students good at math is 12."
"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group takes and then see how many such intervals fit into the total concert time, including the intermission.

First, let's calculate the total time each group takes:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Performance time: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Total time per group = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

Next, we need to account for the intermission:
- Intermission time: 10 minutes

The total concert time is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. We need to subtract the intermission time from the total concert time to find out how much time is available for the groups to perform:
- Total concert time: 120 minutes
- Intermission time: 10 minutes

Time available for groups = 120 - 10 = 110 minutes

Now, we divide the available time by the time each group takes to find out how many groups can perform:
- Time available for groups: 110 minutes
- Time per group: 10 minutes

Number of groups = 110 / 10 = 11

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
11 groups can perform in the concert."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the simple interest earned over 3 years and then add it to the original investment.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Principal (P) = $300
- Rate (R) = three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year. However, the rate is actually 75% or 0.75 in decimal form.
- Time (T) = 3 years

Now, let's calculate the simple interest:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3 \]
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \]
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 675 \]

The total amount after 3 years will be the original principal plus the simple interest:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 675 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 975 \]

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $975."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **White Shirts with Collars:**
   - The store has 40 white shirts.
   - Half of the white shirts have collars.
   - Therefore, the number of white shirts with collars is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).

2. **White Shirts with No Collars:**
   - Since there are 40 white shirts in total and 20 have collars, the number of white shirts with no collars is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

3. **Floral Shirts with Buttons:**
   - The store has 50 floral shirts.
   - 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.

4. **Floral Shirts with No Buttons:**
   - Since there are 50 floral shirts in total and 20 have buttons, the number of floral shirts with no buttons is \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

5. **Difference Between Floral Shirts with No Buttons and White Shirts with No Collars:**
   - We need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars.
   - The number of floral shirts with no buttons is 30.
   - The number of white shirts with no collars is 20.
   - The difference is \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

Therefore, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars."

"Initially, Mr. Smith has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y.

He sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is:
55 - 10 = 45 goats

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y.

So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
45 - 20 = 25 goats

Altogether, the number of goats left in the two farms is:
45 (from Farm X) + 25 (from Farm Y) = 70 goats

70 goats"
"James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month. There are 12 months in a year, so he buys:

\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, on average, James pays $110 for each pair of shoes."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food.
2. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount applied.
3. Add the two amounts together to get the total cost.

Step 1: Cost of 3 baskets of green food
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- Therefore, 3 baskets of green food cost \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

Step 2: Cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount
- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- With a $2 discount for each basket, the cost per basket of red food is \(18 - 2 = 16\) dollars.
- Therefore, 3 baskets of red food cost \(3 \times 16 = 48\) dollars.

Step 3: Total cost
- Add the cost of the green food and the red food together: \(75 + 48 = 123\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount you will have to pay is $123."

"Let's define the variables for the ages of the individuals mentioned in the problem:

- Let \( B \) be the age of your brother.
- Let \( A \) be your age.
- Let \( S \) be the age of your sister.
- Let \( M \) be the age of your mom.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( A = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( A = S + 2 \) or \( S = A - 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( A + B + S + M = 87 \).

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( A \), \( S \), and \( M \) in terms of \( B \) into the sum equation:

\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 3 - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:

\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:

\[ B = 16 \]

Now, we can find your age \( A \):

\[ A = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

So, you are 13 years old."
"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.
2. Determine how many packs are required to meet this need, considering he can only buy whole packs and wants to have some extra glue sticks.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.
- There are 27 students.
- Each student needs 2 glue sticks.
- Total glue sticks needed = 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks.

Step 2: Determine the number of packs required.
- Glue sticks come in packs of 8.
- To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack and round up to the nearest whole number because he can only buy whole packs and wants to have some extra glue sticks.
- 54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs.
- Since he can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number, which is 7 packs.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks."

6 oranges (to daughters) + 3 oranges (to son) = 9 oranges

Therefore, the number of oranges Jennifer remained with is:
12 oranges (initially bought) - 9 oranges (given away) = 3 oranges

Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"Claire earns 1 badge every month. In a year, which has 12 months, Claire will earn:

\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so in the same 12 months, Amber will earn:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ badges}}{2} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so in 12 months, Wendy will earn:

\[ 12 \text{ badges} \times 3 = 36 \text{ badges} \]

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1 year time frame, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:

\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame."

2. Add the number of burritos Mr. George ate to the total consumed by the students.
3. Subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students.
- There are 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos.
- Total burritos for students = 50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos.

Step 2: Add the number of burritos Mr. George ate.
- Mr. George ate 20 burritos.
- Total burritos consumed = 500 burritos (students) + 20 burritos (Mr. George) = 520 burritos.

Step 3: Subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered.
- Initial number of burritos ordered = 600 burritos.
- Total burritos consumed = 520 burritos.
- Leftover burritos = 600 burritos - 520 burritos = 80 burritos.

The total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 80."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. There are 12 red cars.
2. There are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so there are \(12 - 2 = 10\) green cars.
3. There are 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so there are \(3 \times 10 = 30\) blue cars.

Now, let's add up the red, green, and blue cars:
\[12 + 10 + 30 = 52\]

The total number of cars in the rink is 75. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:
\[75 - 52 = 23\]

Therefore, the number of yellow cars is 23."
"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as \( F \), Anne has as \( A \), and Sofie has as \( S \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \)
2. \( S = A + 25 \)
3. \( A = F - 12 \)

First, we can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation to find \( F \).

From the third equation, we can express \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ A = F - 12 \]

From the second equation, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( A \):
\[ S = A + 25 \]
Substituting \( A = F - 12 \) into this equation, we get:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \]

Now, we substitute \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \( 28 \) books.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{28} \]"

\[ 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots."
"To determine how much Greg will spend on jello, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.
2. Determine how many boxes of jello are required.
3. Calculate the total cost.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.**

Greg wants each of the 30 kids to have 4 jello cups. So, the total number of jello cups needed is:
\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups per kid} = 120 \text{ cups} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many boxes of jello are required.**

Each box makes 10 small jello cups. To find out how many boxes are needed to make 120 cups, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups per box:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost.**

Each box of jello costs $1.25. Therefore, the total cost for 12 boxes is:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

So, Greg will spend \(\boxed{15}\) dollars on jello."

5 phones * $700/phone = $3500

The seller gives $4000 in dollar bills. To find out how much change the seller will give back, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given:

$4000 - $3500 = $500

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To determine how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to calculate the total amount each person pays per month and then divide that by 4 to find the weekly amount.

1. Calculate the total amount Madeline pays per month:
   - Madeline pays 60% of the total cost.
   - Total cost per month = $400.
   - Amount Madeline pays = 60% of $400 = 0.60 * $400 = $240.

2. Calculate the total amount Keenan pays per month:
   - Since the total cost is $400 and Madeline pays $240, Keenan pays the remaining amount.
   - Amount Keenan pays = Total cost - Amount Madeline pays = $400 - $240 = $160.

3. Calculate the amount Keenan spends per week:
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Amount Keenan spends per week = Amount Keenan pays per month / 4 = $160 / 4 = $40.

Keenan spends $40 per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pizza pieces Tobias ate each day and then sum them up.

1. **First Day:**
   Tobias ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 pieces.
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ pieces}
   \]

2. **Second Day:**
   Tobias ate 10 pieces.

3. **Third Day:**
   After the first two days, the remaining pieces are:
   \[

\]

So, Tobias has eaten a total of 48 pizza pieces so far."
"To find out how much David will spend, we first need to determine the cost per bottle for both soda and water.

1. **Cost per bottle of soda:**
   - 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00.
   - Cost per bottle of soda = $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

2. **Cost per bottle of water:**
   - 4 bottles of water cost $8.00.
   - Cost per bottle of water = $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we calculate the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.

3. **Total cost for soda:**
   - 3 bottles of soda at $3.00 each = 3 * $3.00 = $9.00.

4. **Total cost for water:**
   - 2 bottles of water at $2.00 each = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

5. **Total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:**

Therefore, the total cost for David to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $13.00."
"To find out how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 16 bolts.
2. Subtract the total cost from David's initial amount of money.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of 16 bolts.
Each bolt costs $0.03, so the total cost for 16 bolts is:
\[ 16 \times 0.03 = 0.48 \]

Step 2: Subtract the total cost from David's initial amount of money.
David initially has $12.48. After spending $0.48 on the bolts, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the profit to find the cost price of the chickens.

First, calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell:
\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \]

Next, calculate the total revenue from selling these chickens:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, so the total cost of the chickens he took to the market is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Profit} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for:

"Julie sold 14 glasses of lemonade. The total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32. Since the boys (Micah and Mitchell) sold an equal number of glasses, we can find out how many glasses each of them sold by subtracting the number of glasses Julie sold from the total and then dividing by 2.

First, we calculate the total number of glasses sold by the boys:
32 (total glasses) - 14 (Julie's glasses) = 18 glasses

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide this number by 2:
18 / 2 = 9 glasses each for Micah and Mitchell.

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold:
14 (Julie's glasses) - 9 (Micah's glasses) = 5

Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"To solve this problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age. If in 10 years she will be 18 years old, we can calculate her current age as follows:

\[ \text{Current age} = 18 - 10 = 8 \]

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Let's denote the number of years from now when this will happen as \( x \). At that time, her age will be \( 8 + x \), and we want this to be three times her current age, which is 8. So we set up the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]
\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item category:

1. **Bacon**: Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total. So, the cost per pack of bacon is:
   \[
   \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]

2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. So, the cost per packet of chicken is:
   \[
   2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet}
   \]
   Since she has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost for chicken is:
   \[
   6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4. Since she has 3 packs, the total cost for strawberries is:
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Apples**: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. So, the cost per pack of apples is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]
   Since she has 7 packs of apples, the total cost for apples is:
   \[
   7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[
10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. Therefore, the amount of money she has left in her budget is:

"Let's denote the usual length of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, plus a 15-minute encore, and the total runtime is 65 minutes. We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes.

"The Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. On Fridays, they make twice as many as on a Tuesday, which means they make 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas on Fridays.

To find the total number of chimichangas made on these three days, we add the number of chimichangas made each day:

125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday) = 500 chimichangas.

Therefore, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"First, we need to determine how many microphones will not find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. Given that 20% of the 50 microphones won't fit, we calculate:

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 microphones

This means 10 microphones will not be paired, and the remaining microphones will be paired up. So, we subtract the 10 microphones that won't fit from the total:

50 - 10 = 40 microphones

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of microphones can be made from the 40 microphones that can be paired. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we divide 40 by 2:

40 / 2 = 20 pairs

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage."

"To find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we first need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower.

For the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the orchids is \(5 \times 5 = 25\).

For the African daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the daisies is \(4 \times 10 = 40\).

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of orchid petals from the total number of daisy petals:
- The difference in the number of petals is \(40 - 25 = 15\).

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids."
"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants:

\[ \text{Outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. To find the number of flowering plants, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, 25% of the plants are flowering plants."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed of a whirligig based on the given information about the speeds of a thingamabob and a whatchamacallit.

1. Let's denote the speed of a thingamabob as \( S \) meters per second.
2. According to the problem, a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a whatchamacallit is \( 11S \) meters per second.
3. We are given that the speed of a whatchamacallit is 121 meters per second. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   11S = 121
   \]
4. Solving for \( S \):
   \[
   S = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second}
   \]
5. Now, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a whirligig is:

   \]

The whirligig spins at 55 meters per second."
"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot every day, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the cost of one carrot as \( C \).

From the problem, we know:
- The cost of the salad is $6.
- The cost of the yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) dollars.
- Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day, and the total cost is $11.

So, the equation for the total cost per day is:
\[ 2C + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2C + 9 = 11 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 2C = 2 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 1 \]

Therefore, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( J \).
2. According to the problem, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. So, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
3. In the following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's. So, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.
4. Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work each week. Therefore, the total amount Tasha earned from mowing Joe's lawn over the two weeks is \( 6J + 6J = 12J \).
5. The total earnings from mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns are \( 6 \times 3J + 6 \times 5J = 18J + 30J = 48J \).
6. The total earnings from mowing lawns and selling lemonade is $80. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   12J + 48J + \text{(earnings from lemonade)} = 80
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   60J + \text{(earnings from lemonade)} = 80
   \]
7. Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for each mowing session, and we know the total earnings from mowing lawns is \( 60J \), we can solve for \( J \) by recognizing that the total earnings from mowing lawns is $60 (since \( 60J = 60 \) when \( J = 1 \)). This means Tasha mowed Joe's lawn once each week, Kamala's lawn three times, and Alba's lawn five times.
8. Substituting \( J = 1 \) into the equation, we get:
   \[
   60 \times 1 + \text{(earnings from lemonade)} = 80
   \]
   \[
   60 + \text{(earnings from lemonade)} = 80
   \]
   \[
   \text{(earnings from lemonade)} = 80 - 60 = 20
   \]

So, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is \(\boxed{20}\)."

Therefore, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is 110 miles."
"Susan originally made 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies for himself, leaving 96 cookies to be divided among her 6 nephews.

To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews:

96 cookies ÷ 6 nephews = 16 cookies per nephew

Each of Susan’s nephews will get 16 cookies."
"Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages.

Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today.

So, the total number of pages Denise read is 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.

Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and 0 pages today, so he read a total of 13 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages Daniel read from the total pages Denise read:

28 (Denise's total) - 13 (Daniel's total) = 15 pages.

Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the total amount of soup Calvin has in terms of bowls.

Calvin's pot can fill:
- 4 adult bowls
- 8 child bowls

Since Calvin and his wife are both adults, they will each have 1 adult bowl, which totals 2 adult bowls for the adults. This leaves us with 2 adult bowls worth of soup for the children (since 4 - 2 = 2).

Calvin has 2 children, and each child's bowl is 1/4 the size of an adult's bowl (since 8 child bowls = 4 adult bowls, 1 child bowl = 1/2 adult bowl).

So, the 2 adult bowls of leftover soup can be divided into:
- 2 adult bowls * 4 child bowls/adult bowl = 8 child bowls

Since Calvin has 2 children and there are 8 child bowls of soup available, each child can have:
- 8 child bowls / 2 children = 4 bowls of soup

Therefore, each child will be able to have 4 bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

"William bought five notebooks at $1.50 each and one ballpen at $0.50.

The cost of the notebooks is:
5 notebooks * $1.50/notebook = $7.50

The cost of the ballpen is:
1 ballpen * $0.50/ballpen = $0.50

The total amount William spent is:
$7.50 + $0.50 = $8.00

He spent a total of $8.00."
"To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can calculate the material required for each type of mask separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 small mask, she needs \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards of material.
- For 20 small masks, she would need \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards of material.

Next, let's calculate the material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 large mask, she needs \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards of material.
- For 8 large masks, she would need \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards of material.

Now, we add the material needed for the small and large masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

Therefore, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tickets Deepa has seen.
2. Divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets to find the average price per ticket.

First, let's calculate the total number of tickets Deepa has seen. Since there are 9 Fast and the Furious movies and she has seen each one 3 times, the total number of tickets is:

\[ 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ tickets} \]

Next, we know that she spent $216 in total. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

\[ \frac{216 \text{ dollars}}{27 \text{ tickets}} = 8 \text{ dollars per ticket} \]

So, the average price she paid per ticket is:

\[ 8 \]"
"To determine Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his activities and subtract that from the total hours in a day.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up the time spent on these activities:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Walk: 1 hour

Total time spent on activities = 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours

There are 24 hours in a day. To find the free time, we subtract the total time spent on activities from the total hours in a day:
24 - 19 = 5 hours

Therefore, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day."
"Tim starts with 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes.

He uses 3 blue shoe boxes for fishing, so the number of blue shoe boxes left is:
7 - 3 = 4 blue shoe boxes.

He uses 1/3 of his red shoe boxes for fishing. Since he has 9 red shoe boxes, 1/3 of 9 is:
9 * (1/3) = 3 red shoe boxes.

So, the number of red shoe boxes left is:
9 - 3 = 6 red shoe boxes.

Therefore, the total number of shoe boxes left in Tim's box is:
4 blue shoe boxes + 6 red shoe boxes = 10 shoe boxes.

Final numerical answer:
10 shoe boxes."
"Sarah has 9 books. Joseph had twice the number of Sarah’s books, so Joseph originally had \(9 \times 2 = 18\) books. Joseph lost 2 of them, so he currently has \(18 - 2 = 16\) books.

Joseph currently has 16 books."
"Dean starts with 30 marbles.

First, he gives 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie:
1/5 of 30 = 30 / 5 = 6 marbles

So, after giving 6 marbles to Jamie, Dean has:
30 - 6 = 24 marbles

Then, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald:
24 - 10 = 14 marbles

Therefore, the number of marbles left for Dean is:
14 marbles"
"To solve this problem, let's first set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( D \) be Duncan's current age and \( A \) be Adam's current age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).
2. Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago.

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 \), and four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).

So, the equation based on the given information is:
\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ 26 = A - 4 \]

Add 4 to both sides to solve for \( A \):
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam is currently 30 years old. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years."
"Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is 2 * 200 = 400 acres.

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Together, the two farms have 200 + 500 = 700 acres.

"Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, which means he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

He gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes. Therefore, for 40 packages, he earns 40 * $0.20 = $8 per hour.

In an eight-hour workday, he would earn 8 * $8 = $64.

Therefore, Colby earns $64 in a typical eight-hour workday."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle:**
   - A normal sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes.
   - An extreme sudoku puzzle takes 4 times that long.
   - Therefore, the time for an extreme sudoku puzzle is \(45 \times 4 = 180\) minutes.

2. **Calculate how many bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes:**
   - John drinks a bottle of water every half hour.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 180 minutes, there are \(180 / 60 = 3\) half-hour intervals.
   - Therefore, John drinks 3 bottles of water in 180 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as \( y \).

From the problem, we know:
- Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
- Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
- There are 20 red balloons.

First, we calculate the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons:
\[ 20 \text{ red balloons} \times 2 \text{ pieces per red balloon} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we know the total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58, so the number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons is:
\[ 58 \text{ total pieces} - 40 \text{ pieces for red balloons} = 18 \text{ pieces} \]

Since each yellow balloon gets 3 pieces of bologna, we can find the number of yellow balloons by dividing the total bologna pieces for yellow balloons by 3:
\[ y = \frac{18 \text{ pieces}}{3 \text{ pieces per yellow balloon}} = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of yellow balloons is \( 6 \).

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, which totals:

100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the interval for a tune-up:

3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time."
"Bruce works 5 hours on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which is \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

To find the total hours Bruce works in all these three days, we add the hours from each day:

\(5 + 10 + 8 = 23\)

Bruce works a total of 23 hours in these three days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: Since 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons would be:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each would cost:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to cover these expenses, the total amount they had together is $28. Since they had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total by 2 to find out how much each girl received:
\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14."

"To calculate the profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Step 1: Total number of lollipops sold
- Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops.
- Total lollipops sold = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops.

Step 2: Total revenue from selling the lollipops
- Each lollipop was sold for $0.8.
- Total revenue = 300 lollipops * $0.8/lollypop = $240.

Step 3: Total cost of buying the lollipops
- Each lollipop was bought for $0.5.
- Total cost = 300 lollipops * $0.5/lollypop = $150.

Step 4: Calculate the profit
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $240 - $150 = $90.

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To find out how many pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and then sum them up.

1. **Cats**: Larry has 3 cats.
2. **Dogs**: He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of dogs} = 3 \times 3 = 9
   \]
3. **Rabbits**: He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of rabbits} = 9 - 2 = 7

"Lana has 27 cups in total and divides them into 3 rows. This means each row has:

\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. Therefore, in each row, there are 4.5 cups of chamomile and 4.5 cups of mint tea. However, since we can't have half a cup in practical terms, we should consider the problem in terms of whole numbers, which implies the division is even in a practical sense, and thus, each row has 4.5 cups of each type of tea, but in practical terms, it would be 4 or 5 cups of each type, but the problem asks for the numerical answer.

So, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:

"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to calculate the number of trips the sloth can make in that time and then divide the total number of berries by the number of trips.

1. First, we calculate the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours. Since each trip takes 4 hours, the number of trips in 8 hours is:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many berries the sloth needs to pick per trip to collect 24 berries in total. We divide the total number of berries by the number of trips:
   \[
   \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}

"First, we need to determine how much water is in the tank after Anthony and his father fill it. The tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water.

\[ \text{Water in the tank} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water is used from the tank over 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day.

\[ \text{Water used in 6 days} = 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank to find out how much water remains.

\[ \text{Water remaining in the tank} = 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

"To find the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the calories in one mini cinnamon roll.
2. Calculate the total calories for all mini cinnamon rolls.
3. Calculate the calories in one mini blueberry muffin.
4. Calculate the total calories for all mini blueberry muffins.
5. Add the total calories from both types of pastries to get the final answer.

Step 1: A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. Since a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, the calories in one mini cinnamon roll are:
\[ 600 \times \frac{1}{3} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Step 2: Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories for the mini cinnamon rolls are:
\[ 200 \times 200 = 40,000 \text{ calories} \]

Step 3: A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. Since a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, the calories in one mini blueberry muffin are:
\[ 450 \times \frac{1}{3} = 150 \text{ calories} \]

Step 4: Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories for the mini blueberry muffins are:
\[ 300 \times 150 = 45,000 \text{ calories} \]

Step 5: Adding the total calories from both types of pastries gives:
\[ 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 \text{ calories} \]

Therefore, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is:

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the week and then divide by the number of days.

1. On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
2. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, so:
   - Tuesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\)
   - Wednesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\)
3. On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
4. On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's sum up the total number of Junebugs removed:
\[ 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 \]

Adding these together:
\[ 39 + 78 = 117 \]
\[ 117 + 78 = 195 \]
\[ 195 + 48 = 243 \]
\[ 243 + 57 = 300 \]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{300}{5} = 60 \]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: \( P + Pa + J = 100 \).
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: \( Pa = J + 10 \).
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: \( P = Pa + J \).

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we have \( J \), we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is \( 50 \) years.

  - Widgets per hour: 45
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days per month: 30
  - Total widgets per month = 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 32,400 widgets

**Step 2: Calculate the revenue generated by each machine.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Total revenue = 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Total revenue = 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

**Step 3: Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.**

- Difference in revenue = Revenue from Widgeteer 3000 - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000
- Difference in revenue = $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

Therefore, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. This means he will stay for a total of 17 hours.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron pays for 24 hours:
\[ 24 \text{ hours} \times \frac{1600 \text{ pesos}}{24 \text{ hours}} = 1600 \text{ pesos} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron pays for the first 12 hours and then adds 70 pesos for each additional hour:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times \frac{1000 \text{ pesos}}{12 \text{ hours}} + (17 - 12) \text{ hours} \times 70 \text{ pesos/hour} \]
\[ = 1000 \text{ pesos} + 5 \times 70 \text{ pesos} \]
\[ = 1000 \text{ pesos} + 350 \text{ pesos} \]
\[ = 1350 \text{ pesos} \]

Now, let's find out how much Cameron would save by choosing the latter option:
\[ 1600 \text{ pesos} - 1350 \text{ pesos} = 250 \text{ pesos} \]

Cameron would save 250 pesos."
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, twice that amount is 10 pounds. Subtracting 3 pounds from 10 pounds gives us 7 pounds for each sheep.

Next, we calculate the total hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each needs 5 pounds of hay. So, the total hay for the goats is:
\[ 15 \text{ goats} \times 5 \text{ pounds/goat} = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we calculate the total hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each needs 7 pounds of hay. So, the total hay for the sheep is:
\[ 12 \text{ sheep} \times 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:
\[ 75 \text{ pounds} + 84 \text{ pounds} = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay."
"First, let's calculate how much John earned in the week:

John earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the amount he spent on gas:
\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John then deposits $100 in the bank:
\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the 5 pencils:
\[ 5 \text{ pencils} \times 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we determine how many $25 pens he can buy with the remaining $100:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ dollars}}{25 \text{ dollars/pen}} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled out. Craig has spelled out 20 words, each with 15 letters. So, the total number of letters Craig has spelled is:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Next, we know that Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled is:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the number of letters Craig has spelled to the number of letters his brother has spelled:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

So, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

\[ 650 \]"
"To find the total number of children in the drill, we need to calculate the number of children in one row and then multiply that by the total number of rows.

Each row has 8 children, and there are 7 rows per school. Since there are 5 different schools, the total number of rows is:

\[ 7 \text{ rows/school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 35 \text{ rows} \]

Now, since each row has 8 children, the total number of children is:

\[ 8 \text{ children/row} \times 35 \text{ rows} = 280 \text{ children} \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the drill is 280."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming all her coupons. Since each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice and she has 9 coupons, the total number of bottles is:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself."
"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing job, we need to consider the following components:

1. The visit charge: $40
2. The labor charge: $35 per hour for 2.25 hours
3. The parts charge: $60

First, we calculate the labor charge. Since the charge is $35 per hour, and the job took 2.25 hours, we multiply 2.25 by $35:

\[ 2.25 \times 35 = 78.75 \]

Next, we add the visit charge, the labor charge, and the parts charge:

\[ 40 + 78.75 + 60 = 178.75 \]

Therefore, the total charge for the job is:

\[ \boxed{178.75} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount:

10 CDs * $15/CD = $150

Now, let's apply the 40% discount:

40% of $150 = 0.40 * $150 = $60

So, the discounted price for all 10 CDs is:

$150 - $60 = $90

Next, we need to account for the 5 CDs that James decides he doesn't like and sells them for $40 each:

5 CDs * $40/CD = $200

Now, we subtract the money he got from selling the 5 CDs from the total amount he spent:

$90 - $200 = -$110

Since the result is negative, it means James was not out any money but actually gained $110 from the sale of the CDs.

Final numerical answer:
James was out $110."
"To calculate how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to multiply the quantity of each type of root crop by its respective price and then sum up the totals.

1. For yams: 6 yams * $1.5 each = $9
2. For sweet potatoes: 10 sweet potatoes * $2 each = $20
3. For carrots: 4 carrots * $1.25 each = $5

Now, we add up the totals from each type of root crop:

$9 (from yams) + $20 (from sweet potatoes) + $5 (from carrots) = $34

Therefore, if Jen sells everything, she will earn $34."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. Calculate the distance James swims initially.
2. Determine the time it takes to swim that distance.
3. Calculate the rest time.
4. Determine the remaining distance.
5. Calculate the time to swim the remaining distance at the reduced speed.
6. Sum up all the times to get the total time.

Let's go through each step:

1. **Distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Time to swim the initial distance:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Rest time:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Remaining distance:**
   The remaining distance is the total distance minus the distance already swum.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Time to swim the remaining distance at the reduced speed:**
   James swims the remaining distance at half the original speed, which is 1 mile per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Total time:**
   Sum up all the times.
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours."
"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many loaves Sam had last Friday.
2. Calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had.
3. Subtract 40 from the result to find out how many loaves the bakery has.

Given that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday, we can calculate:

1. Seven times the number of loaves Sam had: \(7 \times 70 = 490\)
2. Subtract 40 from 490: \(490 - 40 = 450\)

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the commission from the New York Times.
2. Calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal.
3. Add the two amounts to get the total commission.

**Step 1: Commission from the New York Times**
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy of the New York Times.
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- He sells 6 copies.

The commission per copy of the New York Times is:
\[ 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \]

The total commission from 6 copies is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]

**Step 2: Commission from the Wall Street Journal**
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy of the Wall Street Journal.
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- He sells 10 copies.

The commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \]

The total commission from 10 copies is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \]

**Step 3: Total Commission**
- Add the commission from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.

The total commission is:
\[ 3.00 + 12.00 = 15.00 \]

"Deanna is 26 years old.

Since Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, Marcus is:
26 - 5 = 21 years old.

Marcus is also half of Leo’s age, so Leo’s age is:
21 * 2 = 42 years old.

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \) (the total points scored by the team)
2. \( B = A + 20 \) (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)
3. \( B = D + 10 \) (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)

We can use the second equation to express \( A \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]

And the third equation to express \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Now, substitute these expressions into the first equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 25 \) back into the equation for \( A \):
\[ A = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

Final numerical answer:

"To determine the number of pages in the book, we can follow these steps:

1. We know that 100 pages are printed on each inch of paper.
2. The book is 1.5 inches thick.
3. Therefore, the total number of pages is the number of pages per inch multiplied by the thickness in inches.

\[ \text{Total pages} = 100 \, \text{pages/inch} \times 1.5 \, \text{inches} \]

\[ \text{Total pages} = 150 \]

So, the book has 150 pages."
"To determine how many reports Vince stapled, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Vince spent stapling.
2. Determine how many 15-minute intervals are in that total time.
3. Multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports he can staple in each interval.

First, let's find the total time Vince spent stapling. He started at 8:00 AM and stopped at 11:00 PM. The time from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we convert 15 hours into minutes:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
\[ \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince can staple 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and then subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Calculate the usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - Convert 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Determine the actual wake-up time:**
   - Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m., but this day she woke up 5 minutes earlier.
   - So, her wake-up time on this day was 5 minutes before 6 a.m., which is 5:55 a.m.

3. **Calculate the time Kim was awake before sleepwalking:**
   - From 2:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 3 hours and 40 minutes.
   - Convert 3 hours and 40 minutes to minutes: \(3 \times 60 + 40 = 220\) minutes.

4. **Calculate the time Kim was sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is 23 minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time Kim was awake (not sleeping):**
   - Total awake time = Time awake before sleepwalking + Time sleepwalking
   - Total awake time = 220 minutes + 23 minutes = 243 minutes

6. **Calculate the time Kim was actually asleep:**
   - Usual sleep duration = 480 minutes
   - Subtract the total awake time from the usual sleep duration
   - Time asleep = 480 minutes - 243 minutes = 237 minutes

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 237 minutes that day."
"Jonathan has two dozen measuring cups, which is 24 cups.

Given that he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons he initially has:

\[
\text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16
\]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[
16 - 6 = 10
\]

Now, we add the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has:

\[
24 \text{ (cups)} + 10 \text{ (spoons)} = 34
\]

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 34."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Occupancy:**
   - The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds.
   - Initially, 1/5 of the beds are occupied.
   - Number of occupied beds initially = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.
   - Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds initially = \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) beds.

2. **Daily Admissions:**
   - 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of admissions = \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Initially, 200 beds are occupied.
   - After 2 weeks, an additional 700 patients are admitted.
   - Total occupied beds after 2 weeks = \( 200 + 700 = 900 \) beds.

4. **Total Unoccupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - The hospital's total capacity is 1000 beds.
   - Total unoccupied beds after 2 weeks = \( 1000 - 900 = 100 \) beds.

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."

"If Courtney overstated the number of people by 20%, we can set up the following relationship:

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people who attended the concert.

According to Courtney, the number of people was 48, which is 120% (or 1 + 20%) of the actual number of people. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]

\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"To solve this problem, let's define the number of balls each boy carried based on the information given.

Let \( J \) represent the number of balls Jeffrey carried. According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by all three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each boy:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

Now, we can find the number of balls each boy carried:
- Jeffrey carried \( J = 1 \) ball.
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls is:

"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes by the end of the third day after filling in two holes.
3. Use the information that the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

Let's start with the first step:

- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes.

So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29 \]

By the end of the third day, they had 29 holes. After the fourth day, the number of holes is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day is 10, so four times this is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \]

So, the pirates dug \(\boxed{11}\) holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure."

"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \).

According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, so we can express the number of Pokemon caught by Stan as \( 4A - 13 \).

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokemon caught by Alex can be expressed as \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \).

The total number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe is 339. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Adding 21 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 9A = 360 \]

Dividing both sides by 9:

\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we can find the number of Pokemon caught by Stan:

\[ 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

Final numerical answer:

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird flew in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction.

1. The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 10 \, \text{hours} \times 30 \, \text{miles/hour} = 300 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. The bird then flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 2 \, \text{hours} \times 18 \, \text{miles/hour} = 36 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 5 \, \text{hours} \times 22 \, \text{miles/hour} = 110 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Now, we sum the distances flown in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction:
\[
\text{Total distance south} = 300 \, \text{miles} + 110 \, \text{miles} = 410 \, \text{miles}
\]
\[
\text{Total distance north} = 36 \, \text{miles}
\]
\[
\text{Net distance} = 410 \, \text{miles} - 36 \, \text{miles} = 374 \, \text{miles}
\]

The distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles."
"Greta initially made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 12 brownies.

At her office party, she received an additional 1/2 dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.

When she arrived home, there were 4 dozen brownies waiting, which is 48 brownies.

So, the total number of brownies Greta had before the surprise party is:
12 (initial batch) + 6 (from office) + 48 (from friends) = 66 brownies.

During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. Since 1 dozen is 12 brownies, 1 1/2 dozen is 18 brownies.

The number of brownies left over is:
66 (total) - 18 (eaten) = 48 brownies.

Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day."

His brother is twice Nani's age, so the brother is \(8 \times 2 = 16\) years old.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find 25% of Nani's age, we calculate \(8 \times 0.25 = 2\). So, the sister is \(8 - 2 = 6\) years old.

The total age of all three family members is \(8 + 16 + 6 = 30\).

30"
"To determine the total time it will take Andy to restring all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of stringing and then sum these times.

1. For the 3 racquets strung with synthetic gut:
   - Time per racquet: 15 minutes
   - Total time: 3 * 15 = 45 minutes

2. For the 5 racquets strung with polyester string:
   - Time per racquet: 22 minutes
   - Total time: 5 * 22 = 110 minutes

3. For the 4 racquets strung with a hybrid set (half synthetic gut, half polyester string):
   - Time per racquet: 18 minutes
   - Total time: 4 * 18 = 72 minutes

Now, we add up the total time for all racquets:
- Total time = 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes

Therefore, it will take Andy 227 minutes to restring all the racquets."
"John is buying phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which makes a total of 4 phones.

The first 2 phones are at full price, which is $600 each. So, the cost for the first 2 phones is:
2 phones * $600/phone = $1200

The remaining 2 phones are at half price, which is $600 / 2 = $300 each. So, the cost for the remaining 2 phones is:
2 phones * $300/phone = $600

Adding the cost of the first 2 phones and the remaining 2 phones together gives the total cost:
$1200 + $600 = $1800

Therefore, John paid $1800 for all the phones."
"To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. 

Given that Carlton's team has 13 players and Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = \text{Number of players on Carlton's team} + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 13 + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 20 \]

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

\[ \text{Total number of players} = \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} + \text{Number of players on Carlton's team} \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 20 + 13 \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is 33."
"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of slats} = 100 \]

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"Mrs. Harrington initially bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave away 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes given away. Therefore, she had 12 - 4 = 8 boxes left.

She then kept 1/4 of the remaining 8 boxes for herself. So, she kept 8 * 1/4 = 2 boxes.

This means she sold the rest, which is 8 - 2 = 6 boxes.

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the number of oranges she sold is 6 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 120 oranges.

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges."
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, the number of states in India can be expressed as \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India, which is \( x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \).

Simplifying the expression, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \).

Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is 79."
"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford the books, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books.

The cost of the dictionary is $18.
The cost of the dinosaur book is $13.
The cost of the children's cookbook is $8.

Adding these together gives us the total cost of the books:
\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

Next, we need to find out how much more money Tyler needs to buy the books. He has already saved $14, so we subtract this from the total cost:
\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:
\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler has to work \(\boxed{5}\) hours to afford his books."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Robert has 30 cherries.
2. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard. Therefore, Richard has \(30 - 10 = 20\) cherries.
3. The total number of cherries is 60. If we add up the cherries that Robert and Richard have, we get \(30 + 20 = 50\) cherries.
4. This means that Jerry must have \(60 - 50 = 10\) cherries.

Now, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:

\[30 - 10 = 20\]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

Final numerical answer:
20"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine the number of boxes sold for each type of baked good on both days.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 4 fewer boxes than on Sunday

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 5 more boxes than on Saturday
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Now, let's calculate the number of boxes sold on Sunday:
- Gingerbread on Sunday: 10 (Saturday) + 5 = 15 boxes
- Apple pie on Sunday: 15 boxes (given)

Next, we calculate the total number of boxes sold for each type over the two days:
- Total gingerbread: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes
- Total apple pie: 15 (Sunday) - 4 (Saturday) = 11 boxes

Now, we calculate the earnings from each type of baked good:
- Earnings from gingerbread: 25 boxes * $6/box = $150
- Earnings from apple pie: 11 boxes * $15/box = $165

Finally, we add the earnings from both types of baked goods to find the total earnings:
- Total earnings: $150 (gingerbread) + $165 (apple pie) = $315

Therefore, Sunny earned a total of $315 for the two days."
"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of sunscreen Pamela will use over the 8 days.
2. Determine how many bottles are required based on the total usage.

First, let's find out how much sunscreen Pamela uses in one day. She reapplies 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour and is outside for 4 hours a day. Therefore, the amount of sunscreen she uses in one day is:
\[ 1 \text{ ounce/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 4 \text{ ounces/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use over 8 days:
\[ 4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces} \]

Since each bottle contains 8 ounces of sunscreen, we need to determine how many bottles are required to cover 32 ounces:
\[ \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack \(\boxed{4}\) bottles of sunscreen."
"The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. Given that the blue car costs $100, we can calculate the price of the red car as follows:

1. Calculate 40% of the blue car's price: \( 40\% \times 100 = 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \) dollars.
2. Subtract this amount from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car: \( 100 - 40 = 60 \) dollars.

So, the red car costs $60.

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the blue car and the red car together:

\( 100 + 60 = 160 \) dollars.

Both cars cost a total of $160."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Current Age of Emil**: Emil is currently 19 years old.

2. **Age of Emil in 5 Years**: In 5 years, Emil will be 19 + 5 = 24 years old.

3. **Age of Emil's Dad in 5 Years**: When Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad. Therefore, Emil's dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old in 5 years.

4. **Current Age of Emil's Dad**: Since Emil's dad will be 48 in 5 years, his current age is 48 - 5 = 43 years old.

5. **Age of Emil's Brother in 5 Years**: When Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother. Therefore, his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old in 5 years.

6. **Current Age of Emil's Brother**: Since Emil's brother will be 12 in 5 years, his current age is 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

7. **Sum of the Ages of Emil's Dad and Brother Now**: The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother is 43 + 7 = 50.

**Final Answer**: The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 50."
"Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.

Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, which means her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.

Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which means her friend gave her 20 * 2 = 40 beads.

To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we add the beads from her mother, sister, and friend:

20 (from mother) + 30 (from sister) + 40 (from friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount of Thursday, which is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is:
\[ 12 \div 2 = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught over the three days, we add the amounts from each day:
\[ 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, the number of servings Joe has is:
\[ 21 \div 3 = 7 \text{ servings} \]

Final numerical answer:
7 servings"
"First, let's calculate the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Since 20% of the class are football players, we can find this number by calculating 20% of 30 students:

\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 football players.

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after accounting for the football players:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We calculate this number as follows:

\[ 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

Now, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is:

12"
"If Sophie wears size five boots, then Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, which means Charlie wears size \(5 \times 5 = 25\) boots.

To find the average size of the shoes worn by the two, we add the sizes together and divide by 2:

\[
\text{Average size} = \frac{5 + 25}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
\]

The average size of shoe worn by the two is 15."
"To determine how many additional flowers Pat needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them. Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Therefore, the total space required for each plant is:

\[1 \text{ foot (plant)} + 1.5 \text{ feet (space)} = 2.5 \text{ feet}\]

Next, we need to find out how many plants can fit in the 111 feet long flower bed. We do this by dividing the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each plant:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means Pat can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional flowers she needs to buy is:

\[44 - 17 = 27\]

Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:

\[27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, Pat will spend \(\boxed{162}\) dollars at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, so we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9 \text{ pretzels per day} \]

To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the plants for all 5 hanging baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost for one basket:
- Each basket contains 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines.
- The cost of 3 petunias is \(3 \times \$3.00 = \$9.00\).
- The cost of 2 sweet potato vines is \(2 \times \$2.50 = \$5.00\).
- Therefore, the total cost for one basket is \(\$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00\).

Now, we need to find the total cost for all 5 baskets:
- The total cost for 5 baskets is \(5 \times \$14.00 = \$70.00\).

So, Katherine will spend \(\$70.00\) filling all 5 hanging baskets."
"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations first, and then subtract that from the total amount of soil they have.

1. Calculate the soil needed for the sunflowers:
   - Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil.
   - They plant 4 sunflowers.
   - Total soil for sunflowers = 4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds.

2. Calculate the soil needed for the carnations:
   - Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil.
   - They plant 10 carnations.
   - Total soil for carnations = 10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds.

3. Calculate the total soil used for sunflowers and carnations:
   - Total soil used = 12 pounds (sunflowers) + 15 pounds (carnations) = 27 pounds.

4. Calculate the remaining soil for planting roses:
   - Total soil available = 30 pounds.
   - Remaining soil = 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds.

5. Calculate the number of roses that can be planted:
   - Each rose needs 1 pound of soil.
   - Number of roses = 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses.

Therefore, they can plant 3 roses."
"First, we need to calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times \$2,000.00 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with the $500.00 she sets aside each month. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

\[ \text{Number of shoes per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \]

Since she can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0.5 pairs per month, which means she can buy 1 pair every 2 months.

Now, we need to find out how many pairs she can buy in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

\[ \text{Number of pairs per year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months per pair}} = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time it takes for Emily to both peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp:
- Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
- To peel 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{6} = 15 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to sauté 90 shrimp:
- Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- To sauté 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{30} \times 10 = 3 \times 10 = 30 \) minutes.

Since peeling and sautéing are sequential tasks, we add the time for both tasks:
- Total time = Time to peel + Time to sauté = 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

45 minutes"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the temperature changes in the room over the given time periods and then sum them up to find the final temperature difference from the starting temperature.

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - Cooling rate: 2 degrees per hour
   - Total cooling: \(2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 6 \, \text{degrees}\)

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - Cooling rate: 3 degrees per hour
   - Total cooling: \(3 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 12 \, \text{degrees}\)

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - Warming rate: 2 degrees per hour
   - Total warming: \(2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{degrees}\)

Now, we sum up the total cooling and total warming:

- Total cooling: \(6 \, \text{degrees} + 12 \, \text{degrees} = 18 \, \text{degrees}\)
- Total warming: \(4 \, \text{degrees}\)

The net change in temperature is the total cooling minus the total warming:

- Net change: \(18 \, \text{degrees} - 4 \, \text{degrees} = 14 \, \text{degrees}\)

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

**Final answer: 14 degrees**"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

3. **Determine the time between the first and second sightings of the comet:**
   - Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time between the first and second sightings is 75 years.

4. **Calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and the time between the first and second sightings is 75 years, then Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each type of payment and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

2. **Gas bill**: Similarly, he writes one check per month for the gas bill, which also results in:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

3. **Church**: He writes two checks per month to the church. Over a year, this amounts to:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ checks}

4. **Pest and lawn service**: He writes one check every quarter (3 months) to the pest and lawn service. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes:
   \[
   4 \text{ checks}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52
\]

Therefore, Buford writes a total of 52 checks per year."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips each day. These trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes, so the first plane makes \(44 \times 2 = 88\) trips each day.

2. Out of these 88 trips, three-quarters of the flights are to Greece. So, the number of flights to Greece is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66\).

3. The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The remaining flights are \(88 - 66 = 22\). Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is \(\frac{22}{2} = 11\).

Therefore, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Tobias' Howl Duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's Howl Duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' Howl Duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - Combined duration of Tobias and Chikote's howls = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.
   - Therefore, Igneous' howl duration = 60 seconds.

4. **Combined Length of All Howls:**
   - Total howl duration = Tobias' howl + Chikote's howl + Igneous' howl
   - Total howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert Seconds to Minutes:**
   - 120 seconds = 120 / 60 minutes = 2 minutes.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and then subtract that from the total cost of the trousers.

1. Adam's mother gave him $6.
2. Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.
3. The total amount of money given by his parents is \(6 + 12 = 18\) dollars.
4. The trousers cost $30.

Now, we subtract the total amount given by his parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings:
\[30 - 18 = 12\]

So, Adam had to contribute \(\boxed{12}\) dollars from his savings."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
- \(A = 3\) (Akbar's age)
- \(B = 4\) (Alessandro's age)
- The total age of the children is 20, so \(A + B + H + W = 20\).
- Helene's age \(H\) is twice the average age of the group.

First, let's express the total age equation with the known values:
\[3 + 4 + H + W = 20\]
\[7 + H + W = 20\]
\[H + W = 13\]

Next, we know that Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[\frac{A + B + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5\]

So, Helene's age \(H\) is:
\[H = 2 \times 5 = 10\]

Now, substituting \(H = 10\) into the equation \(H + W = 13\):
\[10 + W = 13\]
\[W = 3\]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the total amount of money collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund. This is $500 from the neighbors plus $1500 from the online fund, which totals $2000.

Walter's friend then contributes $200. Adding this to the previous total, we get:

$2000 + $200 = $2200

Walter's lawyer is going to donate three times as much as everyone else has donated. Since everyone else has donated $2200, the lawyer's contribution will be:

3 * $2200 = $6600

Therefore, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ 50 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is \( 2 + 4 = 6 \). The total size of the watermelon can be represented as the sum of the sizes of all the slices. Therefore, the total size of the watermelon is:

\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of each adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his activities and subtract this from the nine hours he has available.

1. Time spent on inpatient rounds:
   - He has 9 inpatients.
   - Each round takes 20 minutes.
   - Total time for rounds = 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes.

2. Time spent on appointments:
   - He has 10 appointments.
   - Each appointment takes 30 minutes.
   - Total time for appointments = 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes.

3. Total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments:
   - Total time = 180 minutes (rounds) + 300 minutes (appointments) = 480 minutes.

4. Convert the total time spent into hours:
   - 480 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 8 hours.

5. Subtract the total time spent from the 9 hours available:
   - 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

Therefore, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to work backwards from the time she wants to serve it, which is 5:00 pm.

1. Frosting the cake takes 10 minutes.
2. Cooling the cake takes 2 hours (120 minutes).
3. Baking the cake takes 30 minutes.
4. Making the cake batter takes 20 minutes.

Adding these times together:
- 10 minutes (frosting) + 120 minutes (cooling) + 30 minutes (baking) + 20 minutes (making batter) = 180 minutes

180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours.

Now, subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to have it ready to serve at 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm.

2:00 pm"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter.
2. Use the total number of chocolate bars sold to find the number of bars per box.

First, let's add the number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter:
- Lisa sold 3.5 boxes.
- Peter sold 4.5 boxes.

Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

We know that together they sold 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:

Number of chocolate bars per box = Total chocolate bars / Total boxes
Number of chocolate bars per box = 64 / 8
Number of chocolate bars per box = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per session for the studio.
2. Calculate the total cost per day for the studio.
3. Calculate the total cost per week for the studio.
4. Calculate the total cost per month for the studio.

First, let's calculate the cost per session for the studio:
- The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
- The cost per student per session is $1.50.
- With 10 students, the cost per session for students is \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost per session is \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost per day for the studio:
- The studio is rented 3 days a week.
- So, the total cost per day is \(40 \times 3 = 120\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost per week for the studio:
- Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the total cost per week is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) dollars.

Finally, we calculate the total cost per month for the studio:
- The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is \(480\) dollars.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To solve this problem, we can set up equations based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( P \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( M \).

From the problem, we know:
- Peter has 4 boxes, and the total number of chocolate bars he has is 64. So, \( 4P = 64 \).
- Martha has 7 boxes, and the total number of chocolate bars she has is 56. So, \( 7M = 56 \).

First, we solve for \( P \) and \( M \):

\[ 4P = 64 \]
\[ P = \frac{64}{4} \]
\[ P = 16 \]

\[ 7M = 56 \]
\[ M = \frac{56}{7} \]
\[ M = 8 \]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:

\[ P - M = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

Final numerical answer:

"To find the number of porcupines in the park after a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of female porcupines.
2. Determine the number of baby porcupines born each month.
3. Calculate the total number of baby porcupines born in a year.
4. Add the number of baby porcupines to the initial population to get the final population.

Step 1: Calculate the number of female porcupines.
The number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population.
\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Step 2: Determine the number of baby porcupines born each month.
Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
\[ \text{Number of baby porcupines born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of baby porcupines born in a year.
There are 12 months in a year.
\[ \text{Total number of baby porcupines born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

Step 4: Add the number of baby porcupines to the initial population to get the final population.
\[ \text{Final population} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

Final numerical answer:
1490"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, so we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

So, the volume of the pool is:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"To find the total number of sticks, let's break down the information given:

1. There are 9 red sticks.
2. There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so the number of blue sticks is \(9 + 5 = 14\).
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is \(14 - 3 = 11\).

Now, to find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

\[9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34\]

Therefore, the total number of sticks they have is 34."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

For Matteo:
- Speed = 55 miles per hour
- Time = 4 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

For Shandy:
- Speed = 45 miles per hour
- Time = 10 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance traveled by Matteo from the distance traveled by Shandy:
- Difference in distance = Distance traveled by Shandy - Distance traveled by Matteo = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."

1. **Total number of students**: 3000

2. **Students over 16 years old**: Half of the total students
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

3. **Male students over 16 years old**: One-fourth of the students over 16 years old
   \[
   \frac{1500}{4} = 375
   \]

4. **Female students over 16 years old**: The remaining students over 16 years old
   \[
   1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

5. **Students under 16 years old**: The other half of the total students
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old**: One-half of the students under 16 years old
   \[
   \frac{1500}{2} = 750
   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old**: The remaining students under 16 years old
   \[
   1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total number of female students**: Sum of female students over 16 and under 16
   \[
   1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is **1875**."
"Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ laps} \]

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ laps} \]

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run:
\[ 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ laps} \]

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \text{ laps} \]

Therefore, Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
   - Tank's capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Water filled by Wanda on the first day = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
   - Water filled by Ms. B on the first day = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the first day = \( 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \) gallons.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water pumped by Wanda on the second day = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final charge percentage to the initial charge percentage when Maria left for the park.

Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( C \).

1. **First 5 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour.
   - After 5 hours, the charge remaining is \( C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).

2. **Next 3 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour.
   - After these 3 hours, the charge remaining is \( C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28% of the initial charge. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = 0.28C \]

We can cancel \( C \) from both sides of the equation:

\[ (1 - 0.09)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, let's calculate the values:

\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357 \]

Multiplying these together:

\[ 0.624032 \times 0.804357 \approx 0.5018 \]

So, we have:

\[ 0.5018 \approx 0.28 \]

This equation is not exactly 0.28, but it's close enough for the purpose of this problem. To find the initial charge \( C \), we can rearrange the equation:

\[ C = \frac{0.28}{(0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.5018} \approx 0.558 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 55.8%.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{55.8\%} \]"
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment for the car, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings.
2. Determine the amount she needs to save for the down payment.
3. Calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save the required amount.

**Step 1: Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings.**

Janet earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips. If she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are:
\[ 40 \text{ hours/week} \times (\$10/\text{hour} + \$15/\text{hour}) = 40 \times \$25 = \$1000 \text{ per week} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount she needs to save for the down payment.**

The car costs $10,000, and Janet wants to save 20% of this amount for a down payment. So, the down payment amount is:
\[ 20\% \times \$10000 = 0.20 \times \$10000 = \$2000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save the required amount.**

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount needed by her weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{\$2000}{\$1000 \text{ per week}} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, Janet will need to work for \(\boxed{2}\) weeks to save the down payment."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jamaar has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost of the items already purchased:

\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10, so the amount of money he has left after his purchases is:

\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:

\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums."
"First, let's calculate the total number of sweets Anne has:

Total packs = 15
Sweets per pack = 60

Total sweets = 15 packs * 60 sweets/pack = 900 sweets

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is:

Packs given to friends = Total packs - Packs kept by Anne
Packs given to friends = 15 - 2 = 13 packs

Now, we need to find out how many sweets are in these 13 packs:

Sweets given to friends = 13 packs * 60 sweets/pack = 780 sweets

Anne gave these 780 sweets equally to her 10 friends, so the number of sweets each friend received is:

Sweets per friend = Sweets given to friends / Number of friends
Sweets per friend = 780 sweets / 10 friends = 78 sweets

Each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply the 5% annual increase to the original price of $120 for each of the three years.

1. **First Year:**
   - Original price: $120
   - Increase: 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
   - New price after first year: $120 + $6 = $126

2. **Second Year:**
   - New price: $126
   - Increase: 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
   - New price after second year: $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

3. **Third Year:**
   - New price: $132.30
   - Increase: 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
   - New price after third year: $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounding $138.915 to the nearest integer, we get $139.

Therefore, the price of carrots after three years would be $139."
"Olivia uploaded 72 pictures in total and distributed them equally into 8 albums. To find out how many pictures are in each album, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (L \times x) + (S \times 2x) \]
Substituting the values of \( L \) and \( S \):
\[ 120 = (12 \times x) + (4 \times 2x) \]
\[ 120 = 12x + 8x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]

"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst due to the wind. 

\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]

So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving her with:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of her 12 yellow balloons:

\[ 12 \div 2 = 6 \]

This means she has:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

yellow balloons left. 

As she nears the school, she finds 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and adds 75% of them to her clutch of balloons. 

\[ 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]

So, she adds 6 blue balloons to her collection. 

Now, we sum up all the balloons she has:

\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 6 \text{ (blue)} = 27 \]

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.5
   - If a substitute teacher is present, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. So, the probability that he does not have to turn in his homework in this scenario is 100% or 1.0.

2. **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher being present: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.4
   - If the normal teacher gives an extension, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. So, the probability that he does not have to turn in his homework in this scenario is 0.4.

3. **Normal Teacher without Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher being present: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.6
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension: 20% or 0.2
   - Probability of Marcus not getting a personal extension: 80% or 0.8
   - If the normal teacher does not give an extension and Marcus does not get a personal extension, Marcus has to turn in his homework. So, the probability that he has to turn in his homework in this scenario is 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.48.

Now, we combine these probabilities:

- Probability of having a substitute teacher and not having to turn in homework: 0.5 * 1.0 = 0.5
- Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension and not having to turn in homework: 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2
- Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus not getting a personal extension and having to turn in homework: 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.24

Adding these probabilities together gives the total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

0.5 + 0.2 + 0.24 = 0.94

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 94%."
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats already allocated for graduates and faculty.
2. Subtract this number from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center to find out how many seats are available for guests.
3. Divide the number of available guest seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive.

Each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish the relationship between the different sizes of jelly beans.

1. First, we know that 75 large jelly beans fill Grandpa up.
2. Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large jelly beans. Therefore, the number of medium-sized jelly beans he can eat is:
   \[
   2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium-sized jelly beans}
   \]
3. Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized jelly bean. Therefore, the number of small jelly beans that is equivalent to 150 medium-sized jelly beans is:
   \[
   3 \times 150 = 450 \text{ small jelly beans}
   \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of soda bottles Richard will place.
2. Determine the total time it will take to place all the bottles and drop the candy.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of soda bottles.**

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. This means the number of intervals between the bottles is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per interval}} = 8 \text{ intervals} \]

Since there is a bottle at the start and one at the end of each interval, the number of bottles is one more than the number of intervals:

\[ 8 \text{ intervals} + 1 = 9 \text{ bottles} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total time to place all the bottles and drop the candy.**

Richard takes 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next and drop the candy. Since there are 8 intervals between the 9 bottles, the total time is:

\[ 8 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ seconds per interval} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

40 seconds"
"Uncle Franky ordered two boxes of apples, and each box contains forty apples. Therefore, the total number of apples he has is:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times 40 \text{ apples/box} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

He plans to pack the apples with eight apples in one pack. To find out how many packs he can make, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:

\[ 80 \text{ apples} \div 8 \text{ apples/pack} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese Amor buys and then subtract that from the $50 she starts with.

First, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:
- The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound.
- Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.
- Therefore, the cost of the Parmesan cheese is \(2 \times 11 = 22\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the Mozzarella cheese:
- The price of Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
- Amor buys 3 pounds of Mozzarella cheese.
- Therefore, the cost of the Mozzarella cheese is \(3 \times 6 = 18\) dollars.

Now, let's find the total cost of the cheese:
- The total cost is the sum of the cost of the Parmesan and Mozzarella cheese.
- Therefore, the total cost is \(22 + 18 = 40\) dollars.

Finally, let's determine how much money Amor has left after buying the cheese:
- Amor starts with $50.
- She spends $40 on cheese.
- Therefore, the amount of money she has left is \(50 - 40 = 10\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:
10 dollars."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim borrowed for college, the total income he would have earned without going to college, and the total income he will earn with his college degree. Then, we can determine how long it will take for him to earn back the money he spent on college and the money he lost by not working during those four years.

1. **Calculate the total amount borrowed for college:**
   - Jim borrows $50,000 per year for 4 years.
   - Total amount borrowed = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

2. **Calculate the total income lost from not working during college:**
   - Jim had a job that paid $25,000 per year.
   - Total income lost = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn back:**
   - Total amount to earn back = Total amount borrowed + Total income lost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

4. **Calculate Jim's new income after earning a college degree:**
   - His income tripled, so his new income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year.

5. **Determine how long it will take to earn back the $300,000:**
   - Time to earn back = Total amount to earn back / New annual income = $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces he requires. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece is:
6 feet (bed length) + 2 feet = 8 feet

And the width of each fabric piece is:
8 feet (bed width) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we calculate the area of one fabric piece:
Area = Length × Width
Area = 8 feet × 10 feet = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
Total area = 80 square feet × 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Monday's Delivery:**
   - The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday's Delivery:**
   - One-fifth of Monday's delivery: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)

3. **Wednesday's Delivery:**
   - Twice as many as Tuesday's delivery: \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \)
   - 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery: \( 204 + 5 = 209 \)

4. **Total Delivery from Monday to Wednesday:**
   - Monday: 425
   - Tuesday: 102
   - Wednesday: 209

   - Total cost = $65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.00."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. So, he won \(2 \times 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11\) dollars.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost and won:
- Total loss: $5 (first race) + $16.5 (third race) = $21.5
- Total win: $11 (second race)

Net loss: $21.5 - $11 = $10.5

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races (3):
\[ \text{Average loss} = \frac{10.5}{3} = 3.5 \]

So, the average loss per race is $3.5.

3.5"
"To find the total population of South America based on the given information, we can follow these steps:

2. Determine the population of each city: Each city has 1000 people.
3. Calculate the total population: Multiply the number of cities by the population of each city. So, the total population is \(130 \times 1000 = 130,000\).

Therefore, the total population of South America, based on the given conditions, is 130,000 people."
"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we first need to calculate their current heights.

Xavier was originally 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert Xavier's original height to inches:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
Adding the growth:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was originally 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem, the second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation as:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is $420."
"To determine the total hours of work each painter put in, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days the painters worked.
2. Determine the total fraction of a day worked per day.
3. Convert the fraction of a day to hours.
4. Calculate the total hours worked by the team.
5. Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours each painter worked.

Let's go through each step:

1. The team worked for 3 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days they worked is:
   \[
   3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}
   \]

2. Each painter worked \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day every day.

3. To convert \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day to hours, we know that 1 day is 24 hours. So:
   \[
   \frac{3}{8} \text{ of a day} = \frac{3}{8} \times 24 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. Since there are 4 painters, the total hours worked by the team each day is:
   \[
   4 \text{ painters} \times 9 \text{ hours/painter} = 36 \text{ hours/day}
   \]
   Over 21 days, the total hours worked by the team is:
   \[
   36 \text{ hours/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 756 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. To find the hours each painter worked, we divide the total hours by the number of painters:
   \[
   \frac{756 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ painters}} = 189 \text{ hours/painter}
   \]

So, each painter put in 189 hours of work."
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) + 2(4) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + x + 8 = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, we can find the number of balls he retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is 10."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% of its value each year (100% - 21% = 79%).

The formula to calculate the value after depreciation is:
\[ \text{Value after depreciation} = \text{Initial value} \times (1 - \text{depreciation rate})^{\text{number of years}} \]

Here, the initial value is $20,000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years is 3 (from 2007 to 2010).

Let's calculate the value in 2010:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the price of the car in 2010 is $9861.

Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 is $9861."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of English books.
2. Calculate the number of German books.
3. Subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books.

Step 1: Calculate the number of English books.
Half of the 50 books are in English, so:
\[ \text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of German books.
10% of the 50 books are in German, so:
\[ \text{Number of German books} = 50 \times \frac{10}{100} = 5 \]

Step 3: Subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books to find the number of Spanish books.
\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (\text{Number of English books} + \text{Number of German books}) \]
\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (25 + 5) = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of Spanish books is 20."

"To determine the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of tiles needed.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of tiles and their price.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of tiles needed.**

Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is:
\[ 1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt} \]

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt. Therefore, the number of tiles needed is:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ SqFt}}{1 \text{ SqFt/tile}} = 200 \text{ tiles} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost.**

Each tile costs $12. Therefore, the total cost for 200 tiles is:
\[ 200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12/\text{tile} = \$2400 \]

**Final Answer:**
The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor is \$2400."
"First, we need to calculate the increased monthly cost of the insurance after the accident. The normal cost is $120 a month, and it increased by 60%. 

To find the increased amount, we calculate 60% of $120:
\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the new monthly cost is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Now, to find the annual cost, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for the insurance."
"Greg uses 4 twin beds + 1 king bed = 5 beds per week.

Since he washes 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, he needs to do 2 loads for the twins and 1 load for the king, totaling 3 loads per week.

In a year, there are 52 weeks. Therefore, the number of loads of laundry he does in a year is:

3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year.

156"
"Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend (Saturday and Sunday), they watch a total of 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

If they continue this pattern for 4 weeks, the total number of movies they can watch is 6 movies/weekend * 4 weekends = 24 movies.

24"
"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so his collection increased to:
100 (previous amount) + 50 (collected last year) = 150 stickers.

This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as last year, which is:
2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Adding this year's collection to his last year's total:
150 (last year's total) + 100 (collected this year) = 250 stickers.

So, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection."
"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food consumed per day and then divide the total amount of cat food by this daily consumption.

1. Calculate the daily food consumption for one cat:
   - Each cat is fed 60 grams of food twice a day.
   - Therefore, each cat consumes \(60 \, \text{grams} \times 2 = 120 \, \text{grams}\) per day.

2. Calculate the total daily food consumption for 3 cats:
   - Since there are 3 cats, the total daily consumption is \(120 \, \text{grams} \times 3 = 360 \, \text{grams}\).

3. Determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last:
   - Divide the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption: \(720 \, \text{grams} \div 360 \, \text{grams/day} = 2 \, \text{days}\).

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \(7 \times 2 = 14\) slices. 

To find the total number of slices they ate, we add the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:
\[10 + 7 + 14 = 31\]

Therefore, the total number of slices they ate is 31."
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, we can express Betsy's part as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for the meal is the sum of both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part is 18 minutes longer, we calculate:

\[ Betsy's \ part = D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long."
"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to add up all the individual charges:

1. **Cast**: $200
2. **Doctor's Visit**: The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the charge would be half of $300, which is $150.
3. **Painkillers**: $4 per pill for 30 pills, which totals to $4 * 30 = $120.
4. **Parking**: $6 per hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours, which totals to $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, we add all these charges together:

$200 (cast) + $150 (doctor's visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"First, we need to determine how many emails James receives in a day that require a response. Since 20% of the emails don't require any response, that means 80% of the emails do require a response.

80% of 80 emails is calculated as:
\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \]

So, James responds to 64 emails each day. 

To find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:
\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

Therefore, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to add up the number of classes that visited each day.

- Monday: 32 classes
- Tuesday: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes
- Wednesday: Three times as many as Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes
- Thursday: 30 classes
- Friday: 25 classes

Now, let's add these numbers together:

\[32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25\]

First, add 32 and 64:

\[32 + 64 = 96\]

Next, add 96 and 96:

\[96 + 96 = 192\]

Then, add 30:

\[192 + 30 = 222\]

Finally, add 25:

\[222 + 25 = 247\]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is:

247"
"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we first need to calculate the total score for all tests and then divide by the number of tests.

John's scores are:
- 100 on the first test
- 100 on the second test
- 100 on the third test
- 80 on the fourth test

The total score is:
100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

The average score is the total score divided by the number of tests:
380 / 4 = 95

Therefore, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by both the glee club and the football team, and then subtract these from the total number of pizzas ordered.

1. **Glee Club:**
   - Ordered 20 pizzas.
   - Ate 70% of them.
   - Number of pizzas eaten by the glee club = 20 * 70% = 20 * 0.70 = 14 pizzas.

2. **Football Team:**
   - Ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so 20 * 2 = 40 pizzas.
   - Ate 80% of them.
   - Number of pizzas eaten by the football team = 40 * 80% = 40 * 0.80 = 32 pizzas.

3. **Total Pizzas Eaten:**
   - Total pizzas eaten = 14 (glee club) + 32 (football team) = 46 pizzas.

4. **Total Pizzas Ordered:**
   - Glee club + Football team = 20 + 40 = 60 pizzas.

5. **Pizzas Left:**
   - Total pizzas ordered - Total pizzas eaten = 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

Therefore, the number of pizzas left is 14."
"Anthony is sending out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. 

First, calculate the number of big coupons:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, calculate the cost for the small coupons:
\[ 700 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, calculate the cost for the big coupons:
\[ 1400 \times 15 \text{ cents} = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

Now, add the costs together to find the total cost:
\[ 3500 \text{ cents} + 21000 \text{ cents} = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, convert the total cost to dollars:
\[ 24500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Anthony spends a total of 245 dollars on postage."
"First, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered. The problem states that Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. So, we calculate:

10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So, the number of meatball sub sandwiches remaining after Mark ate is:

7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches.

Then, Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches. So, the total number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney has now is:

3 + 3 = 6 meatball sub sandwiches.

Since each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is:

6 * 4 = 24 meatballs.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

24 meatballs."
"Mr Hezekiah initially had 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. 

First, we calculate the total amount of fertiliser dispatched:
\[ 20 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 400 \text{ tons} \]

Next, we determine the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 \text{ trucks} = 5 \text{ trucks} \]

The number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:
\[ 20 \text{ trucks} - 5 \text{ trucks} = 15 \text{ trucks} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers:
\[ 15 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 300 \text{ tons} \]

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:
\[ 300 \text{ tons} \]"
"Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. Since he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The promotion at the grocery store is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter he buys, he gets a second pound at half the price.

The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound. Under the promotion, the cost for the second pound is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.

For 6 pounds of butter, we can break it down into 3 pairs of pounds. Each pair will cost $4.00 (for the first pound) + $2.00 (for the second pound) = $6.00.

Therefore, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter is 3 pairs * $6.00 per pair = $18.00.

The final numerical answer is:
$18.00"
"First, let's determine the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- 25 classmates
- 7 girls in her dance class
- 13 family members

Total guests invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Since 4 people said they could not come, the actual number of guests attending the party is:

45 - 4 = 41

The cost to rent the theater is $125, and there is an additional $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20. So, the number of additional guests is:

41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is:

21 * $6 = $126

Adding the base rental fee to the cost for the additional guests gives us the total cost:

$125 + $126 = $251

Therefore, the total cost of the party is $251."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine how much money Maggie and Riza each originally had.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money and was left with $60. This means that the remaining three-quarters of her money is $60. We can set up the equation for Maggie as follows:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times \text{Maggie's original money} = 60
\]

To find Maggie's original money, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Maggie's original money} = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
\]

So, Maggie originally had $80.

Next, we determine how much money Riza originally had. Riza spent one-third of her money and was left with $60. This means that the remaining two-thirds of her money is $60. We can set up the equation for Riza as follows:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times \text{Riza's original money} = 60
\]

To find Riza's original money, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Riza's original money} = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
\]

So, Riza originally had $90.

Now, we calculate how much money each of them has left after spending.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20
\]

So, Maggie has:

\[
80 - 20 = 60
\]

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
\]

So, Riza has:

\[
90 - 30 = 60
\]

Finally, we add the amounts of money that Maggie and Riza have left:

\[
60 + 60 = 120
\]

Therefore, the two of them have a total of $120 left."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Bananas and Days**: Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which are enough to feed his three monkeys for a week (7 days).

2. **Bananas per Monkey per Day**:
   - The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
   - The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so it eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.
   - Let's denote the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day as \(x\).

3. **Total Bananas Eaten by All Monkeys in a Day**:
   - The total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in one day is \(10 + 14 + x = 24 + x\).

4. **Total Bananas Eaten in a Week**:
   - Since the total number of bananas is enough for a week, the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week is \(7 \times (24 + x) = 168 + 7x\).

5. **Equation for Total Bananas**:
   - We know the total number of bananas is 315, so we can set up the equation: \(168 + 7x = 315\).

6. **Solve for \(x\)**:
   - Subtract 168 from both sides: \(7x = 315 - 168\).
   - Simplify: \(7x = 147\).
   - Divide both sides by 7: \(x = 21\).

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

**Final Answer**: The third monkey eats 21 bananas each day."
"Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed 250 pieces. Then, he started and finished another 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed all 500 pieces of the second puzzle.

To find the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we add the pieces from both puzzles:

250 pieces (from the first puzzle) + 500 pieces (from the second puzzle) = 750 pieces

Therefore, Teddy placed 750 puzzle pieces during that hour."
"First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for 15 roses is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which totals:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she needs an additional $5 to cover the cost. The florist can only give change in quarters, and since a quarter is worth $0.25, we need to determine how many quarters make up $5:

\[ \$5 \div \$0.25 = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 20 quarters. 

20 quarters"
"To calculate the total money Terry makes, we need to multiply the quantity of each item by its price and then sum up the totals.

1. Milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 each = $33.00
2. Burger platters: 9 platters * $11 each = $99.00
3. Sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 each = $30.00

Now, we add up these amounts to get the total:

$33.00 + $99.00 + $30.00 = $162.00

Therefore, Terry makes a total of $162.00."
"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find the difference between the time Paul boards the fourth train and the time he arrives at the station.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Departs after 30 minutes (10 minutes arrival + 20 minutes stay).

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train departs, which is 60 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Stays for a quarter of the first train's stay time, which is 5 minutes (20 minutes / 4).
   - Departs after 65 minutes (60 minutes arrival + 5 minutes stay).

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train departs, which is 125 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives, so it departs at 125 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train departs, which is 145 minutes after the first train arrives.

Paul will board the fourth train at 145 minutes after he arrives at the station. Since he arrives at the station at the start (0 minutes), he will wait 145 minutes for his train.

**Final Answer:**
145 minutes"
"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to calculate how many toothpicks she has already saved and then figure out how many more she needs to save.

1. Calculate the total number of toothpicks Melanie has saved so far:
   - She saves 10 toothpicks each week.
   - She has been saving for 12 weeks.
   - Total saved = 10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks.

2. Calculate the number of toothpicks Melanie still needs to save:
   - Total required = 200 toothpicks.
   - Toothpicks already saved = 120 toothpicks.
   - Toothpicks still needed = 200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks.

3. Calculate how many more weeks it will take to save the remaining toothpicks:
   - Toothpicks needed = 80.
   - Toothpicks saved per week = 10.
   - Weeks needed = 80 / 10 = 8 weeks.

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price.

Original price of the watch = $2000

Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for = 75% of $2000
= 0.75 * $2000
= $1500

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for = 120% of $1500
= 1.20 * $1500
= $1800

Now, to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to calculate the difference between the original price and the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for, and then find what percentage this difference is of the original price.

Difference in price = Original price - Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for
= $2000 - $1800
= $200

Percentage discount = (Difference in price / Original price) * 100%
= ($200 / $2000) * 100%
= 0.1 * 100%
= 10%

The percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, a single spring creates 1 jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - 1 minute = 60 seconds
   - Therefore, 4 hours = 4 × 60 × 60 = 14,400 seconds

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since 1 jellyfish is created every second, in 14,400 seconds, one spring will create 14,400 jellyfish.

4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14,400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create 5 × 14,400 = 72,000 jellyfish.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
72,000 jellyfish"
"To find Frankie's score, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that Binkie's score is 90, and Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score.

First, we calculate twice Binkie's score:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Next, we add 15 to this result to find Frankie's score:
\[ 180 + 15 = 195 \]

So, Frankie's score is 195."
"James walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles, and then walked back home, another 2 miles. So, he walked a total of 4 miles.

Since he walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it took him to walk 4 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1 hour

It took James 1 hour to reach the store."
"To determine how much money Jenny saved, we need to compare the cost of buying 10 bunches of bananas versus buying 40 individual bananas (since each bunch averages 4 bananas and she bought 10 bunches).

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches of bananas:
- Each bunch costs $3.00.
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Total cost for bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 40 individual bananas:
- Each individual banana costs $0.80.
- Jenny needs 40 bananas.
- Total cost for individual bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00.

Now, we find the difference in cost between buying the bananas individually and in bunches:
- Cost for bunches = $30.00.
- Cost for individual bananas = $32.00.
- Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \).

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total length of the fence is 100 feet.
2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.

We can express these as equations:
\[ S + H = 100 \]
\[ H = S + 60 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]
\[ 2S = 40 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we can first determine the growth rate per year and then apply it to the 13-year period.

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. So, the growth rate per year is:

\[ \text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \]

Now, to find out how much it will grow in 13 years:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of each type of bike sold.
2. Calculate the earnings from each type of bike.
3. Sum up the earnings to get the total.

First, let's find out how many of each type of bike were sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 50% of 300 = 0.50 * 300 = 150 bikes
- BMX bikes: 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45 bikes
- MTB bikes: The rest, which is 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 bikes

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:

- Price of an MTB: $500
- Price of a BMX: $500 / 2 = $250
- Price of a Trekking bike: $450

Now, we calculate the earnings:

- Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 bikes * $500 = $52,500
- Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 bikes * $250 = $11,250
- Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 bikes * $450 = $67,500

Finally, we sum up the earnings:

Total earnings = $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

Marcel earned $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of bales made by the farmer and the number of bales picked up by the truck each hour, and then determine the net number of bales left in the field after 6 hours.

1. The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.
2. The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.
3. The net number of bales left in the field each hour is \(5 - 3 = 2\) bales.

Over a 6-hour day, the number of bales left in the field would be:
\[2 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ bales}\]

So, after 6 hours, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long. Therefore, the total time spent in classes each weekday is:

\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total time spent in classes during the weekdays is:

\[ 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on these days. First, we find \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly class time:

\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he spends this time equally on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time per week is:

\[ 100 \text{ minutes} \times 2 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent in classes and the extra learning time to get the total weekly learning time:

\[ 1600 \text{ minutes} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, John spends 30 hours a week learning."
"To determine how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the height the ball bounces to on the first bounce.
2. Use that height to calculate the height of the second bounce.

First bounce height:
The ball is dropped from a height of 24 feet. Since it bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height, the height after the first bounce is:
\[ 24 \times \frac{2}{3} = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Second bounce height:
The ball then bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height it reached after the first bounce. So, the height after the second bounce is:
\[ 16 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{32}{3} \text{ feet} \]
\[ \frac{32}{3} \approx 10.67 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is \(\frac{32}{3}\) feet or approximately 10.67 feet.

Final numerical answer:
\(\frac{32}{3}\) feet or approximately 10.67 feet."
"The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many bags of apples were sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings based on the price per bag.

First, we know that each bag contains 10 apples. The orchard sold a total of 2000 apples. To find out how many bags were sold, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we know that each bag is sold for $5. To find the total earnings, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the Triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the Triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The Velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which means \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \) kilograms.

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the Triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate."
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are 10 feet by 8 feet, so each wall has an area of \(10 \times 8 = 80\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is \(80 \times 2 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are 5 feet by 8 feet, so each wall has an area of \(5 \times 8 = 40\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is \(40 \times 2 = 80\) square feet.

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[160 + 80 = 240\] square feet.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[\frac{240}{20} = 12\] gallons.

Finally, since each gallon costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[12 \times 12 = 144\] dollars.

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is $144."
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the probability step by step.

1. Ellen starts with a case of 12 sodas and shakes 3 of them.
2. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas in total.
3. Ellen's brother takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. This leaves 2 shaken sodas and 7 unshaken sodas.

Now, we need to find the probability that Ellen's friend gets one of the shaken sodas from the remaining 9 sodas.

The total number of sodas left is 9 (2 shaken + 7 unshaken).

The number of shaken sodas left is 2.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{2}{9} \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ \frac{2}{9} \times 100 = \frac{200}{9} \approx 22.22\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately 22.22%."
"To find out how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

1. The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled:
   \[ 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

2. The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is 30 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled:
   \[ 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles} \]

3. Adding the distances traveled by both trains gives us the total distance between them:
   \[ 180 \, \text{miles} + 90 \, \text{miles} = 270 \, \text{miles} \]

After 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy works, considering he takes 20% of the days off.
3. Calculate the total number of people Billy can help based on his working hours.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of days
- March has 31 days.
- April has 19 days (from the 1st to the 19th).

So, the total number of days is:
\[ 31 + 19 = 50 \text{ days} \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy works
Billy takes 20% of the days off, so he works on 80% of the days.

\[ 50 \times 0.80 = 40 \text{ days} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of people Billy can help
Billy can help 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day.

\[ 2 \text{ people/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 6 \text{ people/day} \]

Now, multiply the number of people he can help per day by the number of days he works:

\[ 6 \text{ people/day} \times 40 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ people} \]

### Final Answer
Billy helps a total of 240 people."
"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry. 

First, let's calculate the number of people that the buses could carry:
- There were 12 buses.
- Each bus carried 35 people.

So, the total number of people carried by the buses is:
\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people/bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of people that the cars could carry:
- There were 20 cars.
- Each car carried 3 people.

So, the total number of people carried by the cars is:
\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people/car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Now, we add the number of people carried by the buses and the cars to find the total number of people inside the church:
\[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people inside the church is:
\[ 480 \]"
"To find out how old Jeff is, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. Mike is 24 years old.
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, so Martha's age is \(24 - 4 = 20\) years old.
3. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so Jeff's age is \(20 + 10 = 30\) years old.

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old."
"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each of the slides and then find the difference between these times.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute

Time to slide down the biggest slide = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute

Time to slide down the second biggest slide = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time:
Difference in time = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

It takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and two 15-minute breaks each day. 

First, let's calculate the total time spent on breaks and lunch each day:
- Lunch: 30 minutes
- Breaks: 2 breaks × 15 minutes each = 30 minutes

Total time spent on breaks and lunch each day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, Bobby spends 1 hour each day on breaks and lunch.

After 5 days, the total time spent on breaks and lunch is:
1 hour/day × 5 days = 5 hours

Final numerical answer:
5 hours"
"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to calculate how many miles Micah ran and then subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles run.

1. Amber ran 8 miles.
2. Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran \(3.5 \times 8 = 28\) miles.
3. The total miles run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles.

Now, we subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total to find out how many miles Ahito ran:
\[52 - 8 - 28 = 16\]

Ahito ran 16 miles."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise.
2. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract this from the initial charge:
   \[
   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]
3. She then bought a frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00. The sale price of the frying pan is:
   \[
   20.00 \times (1 - 0.20) = 20.00 \times 0.80 = 16.00
   \]
4. She also bought a set of towels on sale for 10% off $30.00. The sale price of the towels is:
   \[
   30.00 \times (1 - 0.10) = 30.00 \times 0.90 = 27.00
   \]
5. Adding the sale prices of the frying pan and the towels to the remaining balance after the return:
   \[
   70.00 + 16.00 + 27.00 = 113.00
   \]

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve for \( J \):

\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90."
"If Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris, then Ben is:

\[ 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

Since Caroline is three times older than Ben, Caroline's age is:

\[ 8 \times 3 = 24 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old."
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs for her retirement and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount given her current savings rate.

1. Calculate the annual amount Lauren needs for retirement:
   - She plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   - Her current annual salary is $100,000.
   - Therefore, the annual amount needed for retirement is \( 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000 \) dollars.

2. Calculate the total amount needed for a 20-year retirement period:
   - The total amount needed is \( 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \) dollars.

3. Calculate how much Lauren saves each year:
   - She saves 20% of her current annual salary.
   - Her current annual salary is $100,000.
   - Therefore, the amount saved each year is \( 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000 \) dollars.

4. Calculate the number of years needed to save the total amount for retirement:
   - The total amount needed is $800,000.
   - She saves $20,000 each year.
   - Therefore, the number of years needed is \( \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \) years.

Since Lauren plans to save for a 20-year retirement period, and it will take her 40 years to save the required amount, she needs to work for an additional 20 years beyond her planned retirement period.

Final numerical answer:
40"
"Marty starts with 100 centimeters of ribbon. He needs to cut this ribbon into 4 equal parts first.

1. To find the length of each of these 4 parts, we divide the total length by 4:
   \[
   \frac{100 \text{ cm}}{4} = 25 \text{ cm}
   \]
   So, each of the 4 parts is 25 cm long.

2. Next, each of these 25 cm parts needs to be divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we divide 25 cm by 5:
   \[
   \frac{25 \text{ cm}}{5} = 5 \text{ cm}
   \]

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 cm long."
"To find the total number of students in the school, we start by using the information that 40% of the school population is 240 boys.

Let's denote the total number of students in the school as \( T \).

Given that 40% of \( T \) is 240, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."
"To find out how much money your mom spent at the gardening shop, we need to add the cost of the pots and the cost of the garden soil, and then subtract the amount of the coupon.

The cost of the pots is $19.
The cost of the garden soil is $26.
The coupon is worth $7 off.

So, the total cost before the coupon is:
$19 + $26 = $45

After applying the coupon, the total cost is:
$45 - $7 = $38

Therefore, your mom spent $38 at the gardening shop."
"To find the average height of the heels at the party, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total height of all the heels.

Step 1: Calculate the total height of all the heels.
- Total height from 4-inch heels: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches
- Total height from 2-inch heels: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches
- Total height of all heels: \(12 + 6 = 18\) inches

Step 2: Divide the total height by the number of heels.
- Total number of heels: \(3 + 3 = 6\)
- Average height of heels: \(\frac{18}{6} = 3\) inches

The average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To complete her journey of 9,300 miles in June, we need to determine how many miles per day Soledad must hike if she wants to finish on time.

First, let's calculate the total number of days in June:
- June has 30 days.

Next, let's determine how many miles Soledad plans to hike each day if she walks twice a day, covering 125 miles each time:
- Miles per day = 125 miles * 2 = 250 miles.

Now, let's calculate the total miles she would hike in June if she walks 250 miles each day:
- Total miles in June = 250 miles/day * 30 days = 7,500 miles.

Since Soledad's goal is to hike 9,300 miles, we need to find out how many more miles she needs to hike each day to reach her goal:
- Additional miles needed = 9,300 miles - 7,500 miles = 1,800 miles.

To find out how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we divide the additional miles needed by the number of days in June:
- Additional miles per day = 1,800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles/day.

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

60 miles/day"
"To find out how much the store will have received after all the balls are sold, we need to calculate the total revenue from each color of ball and then sum these amounts.

1. **Red balls:**
   - Number of red balls: 3
   - Cost per red ball: $9
   - Total revenue from red balls: \(3 \times 9 = 27\)

2. **Blue balls:**
   - Number of blue balls: 11
   - Cost per blue ball: $5
   - Total revenue from blue balls: \(11 \times 5 = 55\)

3. **Green balls:**
   - Number of green balls: 25
   - Cost per green ball: $3
   - Total revenue from green balls: \(25 \times 3 = 75\)

Now, we sum the revenues from all the balls:
\[27 + 55 + 75 = 157\]

The store will have received \(\boxed{157}\) dollars after all the balls are sold."
"Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples in total.

Peter wants a quarter of that, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \, \text{kg} \]

Paul wants 1/3 of that, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \, \text{kg} \]

Together, Peter and Paul want:
\[ 3 \, \text{kg} + 4 \, \text{kg} = 7 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, James will have:
\[ 12 \, \text{kg} - 7 \, \text{kg} = 5 \, \text{kg} \]

James will have 5 kilograms of apples left."
"The temperature started at 2 degrees Celsius. It dropped by 8 degrees, so the temperature became:

2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Raymond starts with $21.
2. He saves an additional $11 from his allowance.
3. He spends $5 on a comic book.
4. He spends $19 on a puzzle.

First, we add the money he saved to his initial amount:
\[ 21 + 11 = 32 \]

Next, we subtract the cost of the comic book:
\[ 32 - 5 = 27 \]

Then, we subtract the cost of the puzzle:
\[ 27 - 19 = 8 \]

So, the final amount of money Raymond has left is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To find out how much each of the books cost, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Anna spent in total.
2. Calculate the cost of each book.

First, we know Anna's initial budget was $16 and she has $2 left after her purchase. Therefore, the total amount she spent is:
\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Next, we know she spent $4 before buying the 2 books today. So, the amount she spent on the 2 books is:
\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Since she bought 2 books and they cost the same amount, the cost of each book is:
\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, each of the books cost $5."
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we first need to calculate the 20% increase in the number of students from last year.

Last year's enrollment: 50 students

20% of 50 students = 0.20 * 50 = 10 students

Now, we add this increase to last year's enrollment to find this year's enrollment:

50 students + 10 students = 60 students

This year, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class."
"To determine how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times, we first need to find the rate at which the light blinks. We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. 

First, we calculate the number of blinks per minute:
\[ \text{Blinks per minute} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Next, we use this rate to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times."
"Initially, in Tate's garden pond, there are:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

After Tate buys more fish, the numbers become:
- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes: 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11
- Total female fishes: 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16

To find out how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:
16 (female fishes) - 11 (male fishes) = 5

Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes."
"To solve this problem, let's break down the time each person took to complete their chores:

1. Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.
2. Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog, so Megan took \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.
3. Dior took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia to do laundry, so Dior took \(4 + 4 + 1 = 9\) hours (since ""well over 4 hours"" means at least 5 hours, and the smallest integer over 4 is 5, but to be sure, we can use 9 as a clear example).

Now, we add up the time each person took:

- Amalia: 4 hours
- Megan: 6 hours
- Dior: 9 hours

Total time = \(4 + 6 + 9 = 19\) hours.

Therefore, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 19 hours."
"John drives 2 hours each way at a speed of 70 mph. To find the distance for one way, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

\[ \text{Distance one way} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Since it's a round trip, we double this distance:

\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

John visits his parents twice a month, so the total monthly driving distance is:

\[ \text{Total monthly driving distance} = 280 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 560 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, John drives 560 miles a month when visiting his parents."
"Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. Over 7 days, she will walk:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, the distance Brian will walk in 7 days is:

\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers and then determine how many toys the fifth worker must produce to meet the order.

First, let's calculate the production of the first four workers:

- The first two workers produce 6 toys an hour each. Together, they produce \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.
- The next two workers produce 4 toys an hour each. Together, they produce \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.

So, the total production of the first four workers per hour is \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

Since they work for 10 hours, the total production by the first four workers is \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys.

The order requires 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. This means that the first four workers have produced \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

Since the first four workers have produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked:

\[
\frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys per hour}
\]

Therefore, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog. Since Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds, Elijah's first dog weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog. So, Elijah's second dog weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the total weight of all the dogs, we add the weights of Kory's dog and Elijah's two dogs:

\[ 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is 105 pounds."
"Let's work backwards from the information given:

1. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob. So, Kris originally had \(9 + 7 = 16\) stickers.
2. Luis gave all of his stickers to Kris, so Luis had 16 stickers before giving them to Kris.
3. Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris. This means the 16 stickers Luis had were the other half he didn't use. So, Luis originally had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.
4. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Seth originally had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

Therefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of M&M that John has:

3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces

Next, we need to find out how many M&M he has in total. Since there are 30 M&M in an ounce:

30 ounces * 30 M&M per ounce = 900 M&M

Now, if he puts 10 M&M in each small bag, we can find out how many small bags he can make by dividing the total number of M&M by the number of M&M per small bag:

900 M&M / 10 M&M per small bag = 90 small bags

Therefore, John can make 90 small bags of M&M."
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate half of the circumference of the earth.
2. Divide this distance by the distance Alfie flies each day.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the daily distance:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."
"To find out how fast the fastest car can go, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use that to find the speed of the fastest car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. So, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
\[ 120 \text{ mph} \times 5 = 600 \text{ mph} \]

Next, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, the speed of the fastest car is:
\[ 600 \text{ mph} \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ mph} \]

Therefore, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour."
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old two years ago. Therefore, Vince is now 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

Vince is now 9 years old."
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as \(A\), by Madeline as \(M\), by Camden as \(C\), and by Sarah as \(S\).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \(A = M\).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \(C + S = 30\).
3. Camden painted 12 more than Sarah: \(C = S + 12\).

First, we can substitute the value of \(C\) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[S + 12 + S = 30\]
\[2S + 12 = 30\]
\[2S = 18\]
\[S = 9\]

Now, we can find \(C\):
\[C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21\]

Next, we know that Arnold and Madeline together with Camden and Sarah painted 56 eggs:
\[A + M + C + S = 56\]
Since \(A = M\), we can substitute \(M\) with \(A\):
\[A + A + 21 + 9 = 56\]
\[2A + 30 = 56\]
\[2A = 26\]
\[A = 13\]

Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[C - A = 21 - 13 = 8\]

Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold."
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Since each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box, Nik will need 25 boxes.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we calculate the total weight of the boxes:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives us the total weight:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds."
"First, let's calculate how much of the tree can be turned into logs. John can make logs out of 80% of the 80-foot tree:

\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs can be cut from the 64 feet of usable wood:

\[ \frac{64}{4} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

From each log, John cuts 5 planks. Therefore, the total number of planks he can get from all the logs is:

\[ 16 \times 5 = 80 \text{ planks} \]

If he sells each plank for $1.2, the total amount he makes is:

\[ 80 \times 1.2 = 96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Valerie earns $5000 per month. Her brother earns twice Valerie's salary, which is:

\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Their combined salary is:

\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is:

\[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \]

The total amount of money they all have together is:

\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"Given that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach and the beach portion of the trail is 2 miles, we can determine her speed on the beach. 

First, we calculate her speed on the beach:
\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{\text{Distance on the beach}}{\text{Time on the beach}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we calculate the time spent walking on the sidewalk, which is 1 mile:
\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance on the sidewalk}}{\text{Speed on the sidewalk}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk gives us the total time for the 3-mile walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it takes Grandma 50 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk."
"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate how much Jane has already saved.
2. Determine how much more she needs to save to reach $60.
3. Calculate how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining amount.

Step 1: Calculate how much Jane has already saved.
Jane has saved $4 every week for 8 weeks.
So, her total savings so far = $4/week * 8 weeks = $32.

Step 2: Determine how much more she needs to save to reach $60.
Total amount needed - Amount already saved = $60 - $32 = $28.

Step 3: Calculate how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining amount.
Since she saves $4 each week, the number of weeks needed to save $28 is:
$28 / $4/week = 7 weeks.

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"To find the total number of blue birds in the trees, we need to add up the number of birds in each tree.

First, we calculate the number of blue birds in the 3 trees that each had 7 blue birds:
3 trees * 7 blue birds/tree = 21 blue birds

Next, we calculate the number of blue birds in the 2 trees that each had 4 blue birds:
2 trees * 4 blue birds/tree = 8 blue birds

Finally, we add the number of blue birds in the last tree, which had 3 blue birds:
1 tree * 3 blue birds/tree = 3 blue birds

Now, we add all these numbers together to get the total number of blue birds:
21 + 8 + 3 = 32

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how many marbles Bob originally has. We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. So, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. This means that before receiving the 24 marbles, he had \(60 - 24 = 36\) marbles.

2. Now, we need to find out how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 of his marbles. Since he originally has 36 marbles, if he loses 10, he will have \(36 - 10 = 26\) marbles.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
26"
"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug, we need to consider the final temperature of the water after Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. Since the final temperature is at least 40 degrees, we can use the concept of weighted averages to find the minimum temperature of the second mug.

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \).

The total volume of water in the water bottle after pouring is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces. The total heat content of the water in the bottle is the sum of the heat content from both mugs. The heat content is proportional to the temperature and the volume of water.

The heat content from the 33-degree mug is \( 4 \times 33 \) degrees-ounces.
The heat content from the second mug is \( 1 \times T \) degrees-ounces.

The average temperature of the water in the bottle is given by the total heat content divided by the total volume of water:

\[
\frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiplying both sides by 5 to clear the denominator:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{68}
\]"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over the three-week period and then add these to the initial numbers.

1. **Initial number of cows**: 50
2. **Initial number of chickens**: 20
3. **Cows added per day**: 20
4. **Chickens added per day**: 10
5. **Number of days in three weeks**: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Now, calculate the total number of cows and chickens added over 21 days:

- **Total cows added**: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
- **Total chickens added**: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Now, add the initial numbers to the totals added:

- **Total cows**: 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows
- **Total chickens**: 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

Finally, add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals:

- **Total animals**: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

**Final numerical answer:**
700"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for 4 packs of bagels before the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times \$10.00 = \$40.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total:
\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost per single bagel by dividing the total cost by the number of bagels:
\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \text{ per bagel} \]

So, the cost per single bagel is:
\[ \$1.00 \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means Gomer ate \(23 - 5 = 18\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

2. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means it takes \(6 - 3 = 3\) potatoes to make \(3 - 1 = 2\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we need to determine how many sets of 2 scoops are in 18 scoops.
   - There are \(18 \div 2 = 9\) sets of 2 scoops in 18 scoops.

4. Since each set of 2 scoops requires 3 potatoes, for 9 sets, we need \(9 \times 3 = 27\) potatoes.

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes."
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs he consumes over the 60 days.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs for the first 30 days is:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs for the next 30 days is:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of eggs consumed over the 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of red jellybeans.
2. Calculate the total number of green and red jellybeans.
3. Subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans to find the number of blue jellybeans.

Step 1: Jess can see that there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans. Therefore, the number of red jellybeans is:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Step 2: The total number of green and red jellybeans is:
\[ 17 + 34 = 51 \]

Step 3: The total number of jellybeans in the jar is 60. Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of passengers:

\[ 5x + 9x = 84 \]

Where \( x \) is the common multiplier for the ratio. Combining the terms on the left side, we get:

\[ 14x = 84 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{84}{14} = 6 \]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:

- Number of men: \( 5x = 5 \times 6 = 30 \)
- Number of women: \( 9x = 9 \times 6 = 54 \)

If 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

\[ 54 - 20 = 34 \]

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day.
2. Calculate the number of sunflowers sold in 3 days.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day.**

- Faraday earns $26 per day from selling sunflowers.
- Each sunflower costs $2.

The number of sunflowers sold per day is:
\[ \frac{\text{Daily earnings from sunflowers}}{\text{Price per sunflower}} = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of sunflowers sold in 3 days.**

- Number of sunflowers sold per day = 13
- Number of days = 3

The total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days is:
\[ 13 \times 3 = 39 \]

"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Since each rock costs $5, we divide $100 by $5:

\[ \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Adam can buy 20 rocks.

Next, we need to find out how many rocks he sells. He sells 60% of his inventory, so we calculate 60% of 20:

\[ 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \]

Adam sells 12 rocks.

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling these 12 rocks. Each rock is sold for $7, so:

\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \]

Adam earns $84 from selling the rocks.

To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to subtract the revenue from the initial investment. Adam's initial investment is $100, and his revenue is $84, so:

\[ 100 - 84 = 16 \]

Therefore, Adam loses $16."
"To determine how many days it will take Lauren to create all the picture scenes, we need to calculate the total number of days required for each size of picture scene and then sum these values.

1. **Large-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for large-sized scenes is \( \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) days.

2. **Medium-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for medium-sized scenes is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) days.

3. **Small-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for small-sized scenes is \( \frac{49}{7} = 7 \) days.

Now, we sum the days required for each size of picture scene:

First, let's calculate the total distance:
- Distance for the first part of the trip: 110 miles
- Distance for the second part of the trip: 140 miles
- Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Next, let's calculate the total time:
- Time for the first part of the trip: 2 hours
- Time for the second part of the trip: 3 hours
- Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, we can find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
- Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour

The average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to first determine the probability of winning for the second ticket.

Given:
- The probability of winning the first ticket is 20%, or 0.20.
- The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket.

So, the probability of winning the second ticket is:
\[ 0.20 \times 3 = 0.60 \]

Now, to find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of each event happening:
\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

Expressing this as a percentage:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"First, let's determine how many seashells Carlos collected. We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, Carlos collected:

\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \text{ seashells} \]

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. Therefore, Carrey collected:

\[ \frac{22}{2} = 11 \text{ seashells} \]

Now, we can find the total number of seashells collected by adding the seashells collected by each person:

\[ 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \text{ seashells} \]

They decided to divide all the seashells equally among themselves. Since there are 3 people, each person will get:

\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ seashells} \]

So, each person gets 20 seashells."

"To satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required based on the information given.

1. Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
2. Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required would be:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles they need to produce, we subtract the current production from the total required:
\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce an additional 7300 bottles of juice to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people."

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old."
"Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. If he goes out three times a day, the number of face masks he uses per day is:

\[ 2 \text{ masks/go} \times 3 \text{ go/day} = 6 \text{ masks/day} \]

For 2 days, the total number of face masks he uses is:

\[ 6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks} \]

Therefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen equals 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei: \(5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\) eggs.

To find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs hidden: \(36 - 27 = 9\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
9 eggs are still hidden in the yard."
"First, let's calculate the number of apartments in the third complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have:

\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. So, we calculate 60% of 400:

\[ 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \]

Adding this to the 400 apartments gives us the total number of apartments in the third complex:

\[ 400 + 240 = 640 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of apartments in all three complexes:

\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:

\[ 1040 \times 3 = 3120 \]

He gets paid $0.40 per collection. So, the total amount of money he makes in a week is:

\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \]

2. **6-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. Let's denote the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces as \(x\). Therefore, the 8-year-old tree produces \(x - 200\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old avocado tree**: Doesn't produce any fruit.
6. **10-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we need to find the value of \(x\) (the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces). According to the problem, the 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than the 10-year-old tree, so:
\[ x - 200 = 1000 - 200 = 800 \]
Thus, \(x = 1000\).

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits produced over the 10 years:
\[ 50 + 150 + 350 + (1000 - 200) + 0 + 1000 \]
\[ = 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 \]
\[ = 2450 \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 2450."
"Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100, which is $100 * 1/5 = $20.

Jack originally had $100, so after receiving $20 from Sophia, he now has $100 + $20 = $120.

Final numerical answer:
120"
"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters, and the length of the red rope as \( R \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we can express \( Y \) in terms of \( B \) using the second relationship:
\[ Y = B + 7 \]

Now, we substitute \( R \) and \( Y \) in terms of \( B \) into the third equation:
\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 5 \]

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( R \):
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters."
"First, let's determine how much money Rissa was given. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars. According to the problem, after giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, both Ronnie and Rissa gave $3 to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Initially, Ronnie had $5, and he gave $3 to his little sister, so the amount of money left with Ronnie is:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Given that the mural uses 12 pints of paint in total and that half of the mural is yellow, we can determine the amount of yellow paint used:

\[ \text{Amount of yellow paint} = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Since the mural has equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, and the total amount of paint used for these three colors is the remaining half of the mural:

\[ \text{Total amount of red, white, and purple paint} = 12 - 6 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we divide the total amount of these three colors by 3:

\[ \text{Amount of red paint} = \frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, the number of pints of red paint used is:

2 pints"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:

\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total area of the house is:

\[ 3160 \text{ square feet} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cloud puffs Alice counts each day and then sum them up for the five days.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
2. **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Monday, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the puffs from all five days:
\[3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93\]

At the end of the week, Alice will have counted a total of 93 cloud puffs."
"First, let's determine the number of pods in the special size box. The regular box contains 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods.

\[ 100 \text{ pods} + (20\% \times 100 \text{ pods}) = 100 \text{ pods} + 20 \text{ pods} = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. To find the cost per pod in the special size box, we divide the total cost by the number of pods:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Since the cost per pod is $0.10, the number of dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 is:

\[ \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}} = 10 \text{ pods} \]

Therefore, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1 with the new box."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of 20 dollar bills he withdraws is:
   \[
   \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. So, the number of bills he has left is:
   \[
   50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining 40 bills to pay for a bill. So, the number of bills he uses is:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
   \]
   The amount he uses is:
   \[
   20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   After paying the bill, the number of bills he has left is:
   \[
   40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas then triples his money. The amount of money he has now is:
   \[
   20 \times 20 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   The number of 20 dollar bills he has is:
   \[
   20 \text{ bills}
   \]

5. **Converting to 5 Dollar Bills:**
   To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we need to convert the 20 dollar bills to 5 dollar bills. Since each 20 dollar bill can be converted to 4 five dollar bills (because \(20 \div 5 = 4\)), the total number of 5 dollar bills he has is:
   \[
   20 \times 4 = 80 \text{ bills}
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{80}

"In the first half:
- Team A scores 4 goals.
- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, which is 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half:
- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals.
- Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, which is 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

Total number of goals scored in the match:
- Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
- Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

Total goals = 6 (Team A) + 10 (Team B) = 16 goals

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the length of the chalk after Monday.
2. Calculate how much chalk is used each day.
3. Determine how many days the chalk will last before it needs to be recycled.

**Step 1: Determine the length of the chalk after Monday.**

The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk and used 45% of it on Monday. Therefore, the remaining length of the chalk is:
\[ 5 \text{ inches} \times (1 - 0.45) = 5 \text{ inches} \times 0.55 = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]

**Step 2: Calculate how much chalk is used each day.**

The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. So, the length of chalk used each day is:
\[ \text{Length used each day} = \text{Current length} \times 0.20 \]

**Step 3: Determine how many days the chalk will last before it needs to be recycled.**

The teacher will recycle the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. We need to find out how many days it will take for the chalk to be reduced to less than 2 inches.

Let's denote the number of days as \( n \). The length of the chalk after \( n \) days can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Length after } n \text{ days} = 2.75 \times (0.80)^n \]

We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that:
\[ 2.75 \times (0.80)^n < 2 \]

To solve for \( n \), we can use logarithms:
\[ (0.80)^n < \frac{2}{2.75} \]
\[ (0.80)^n < \frac{8}{11} \]
\[ n \log(0.80) < \log\left(\frac{8}{11}\right) \]
\[ n > \frac{\log\left(\frac{8}{11}\right)}{\log(0.80)} \]

Using a calculator:
\[ \log\left(\frac{8}{11}\right) \approx -0.1549 \]
\[ \log(0.80) \approx -0.0969 \]
\[ n > \frac{-0.1549}{-0.0969} \approx 1.60 \]

Since \( n \) must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number:
\[ n = 2 \]

Therefore, the teacher has 2 days before he has to recycle the piece of chalk.

   - Number of girls on varsity = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \).

2. Calculate the number of boys on varsity:
   - One-fourth of the boys are on varsity.
   - Number of boys on varsity = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \).

3. Calculate the total number of students on varsity:
   - Total students on varsity = Number of girls on varsity + Number of boys on varsity = 4 + 3 = 7.

4. Calculate the total number of students not on varsity:
   - Total students in the class = 12 boys + 12 girls = 24.
   - Students not on varsity = Total students - Students on varsity = 24 - 7 = 17.

Therefore, the number of students not on varsity is 17."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of teeth drilled:**
   - The dentist drills 4 teeth.

2. **Determine the number of teeth capped:**
   - The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills.
   - Therefore, the number of teeth capped = 4 (drilled) + 7 = 11 teeth.

3. **Calculate the total number of teeth fixed:**
   - Teeth fixed = Teeth drilled + Teeth capped = 4 + 11 = 15 teeth.

4. **Calculate the percentage of teeth fixed:**
   - Total teeth = 30
   - Teeth fixed = 15
   - Percentage of teeth fixed = (Teeth fixed / Total teeth) * 100
   - Percentage of teeth fixed = (15 / 30) * 100 = 0.5 * 100 = 50%

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine how much milk Mr. Marcellus returned to the company. He returned 2/5 of the 4000 gallons of milk.

\[ \text{Amount of milk returned} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} \]

\[ \text{Amount of milk returned} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we calculate the refund amount based on the price per gallon, which is $3.5.

\[ \text{Refund amount} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} \]

\[ \text{Refund amount} = \$5600 \]

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600."
"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 5(C + 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7) \]

Next, we'll eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, we'll isolate \( C \) by moving terms involving \( C \) to one side and constants to the other:
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books he can buy per school.

First, we know that Bob can buy 100 books for $500. To find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy with $27000, we divide $27000 by $500:

\[ \frac{27000}{500} = 54 \]

This means Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books. Since each set is 100 books, the total number of books he can buy is:

\[ 54 \times 100 = 5400 \]

Now, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books he can buy per school. Since there are 3 schools, we divide 5400 by 3:

\[ \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \]

So, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

\[ \boxed{1800} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices and pepperoni pizza slices that Kate's friends will eat.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

So, for 6 friends, the total number of slices eaten will be:
- Cheese pizza slices: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices}\)
- Pepperoni pizza slices: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices}\)

Now, we need to determine how many whole cheese and pepperoni pizzas are required to provide these slices.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- Therefore, the number of cheese pizzas needed is \( \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \).

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- Therefore, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is \( \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \).

Adding the number of cheese and pepperoni pizzas together, Kate needs to buy:
- \(3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas}\).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Snowballs Built Per Hour**: Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour.

2. **Snowballs Melted Per 15 Minutes**: 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 fifteen-minute intervals in an hour, the number of snowballs that melt in an hour is \(2 \times 4 = 8\).

3. **Net Snowballs Built Per Hour**: The net number of snowballs Jay builds in an hour is the number he builds minus the number that melt, which is \(20 - 8 = 12\).

4. **Snowballs Needed**: Jay needs 60 snowballs.

5. **Time Calculation**: To find out how many hours it will take to build 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net number of snowballs built per hour. So, \(60 \div 12 = 5\) hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Jim's age at the time Digimon came out and then find out how old he is now.

1. First, we need to find out how many years ago Digimon came out. Since John is 28 now and he was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out, we can set up the following relationship:

Let \( J \) be Jim's age when Digimon came out, and \( 2J \) be John's age at that time. Since John is 28 now, the number of years since Digimon came out is \( 28 - 2J \).

2. We know that John was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out, so we can write the equation:
\[ 2J = 28 - (28 - 2J) \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 2J = 28 - 28 + 2J \]
\[ 2J = 2J \]
This equation is true but doesn't give us a specific value for \( J \). Instead, we can use the fact that John was twice as old as Jim at the time of Digimon's release. So, if we let \( x \) be the number of years ago Digimon came out, then:
\[ 28 - x = 2J \]
And since \( x = 28 - 2J \), we can substitute:
\[ 28 - (28 - 2J) = 2J \]
\[ 28 - 28 + 2J = 2J \]
This is a tautology, so we need to find \( J \) directly. Since John is 28 now and he was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out, we can say:
\[ 28 - x = 2J \]
And since \( x = 28 - 2J \), we can solve for \( J \):
\[ 28 - (28 - 2J) = 2J \]
\[ 28 - 28 + 2J = 2J \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 2J = 14 \]
\[ J = 7 \]
So, Jim was 7 years old when Digimon came out. Since it has been 20 years since then, Jim's current age is:
\[ 7 + 20 = 27 \]

Therefore, Jim is 27 years old now."
"Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

They all ate a total of 6 slices of apple."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - The nurses used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the first day, they had \(50 - 38 = 12\) bandages left.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - At the end of the second day, they had \(12 - 28 = -16\) bandages, but since they can't have a negative number of bandages, this means they needed to order more bandages to cover the deficit. They ordered another bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the second day, they had \(50 - 16 = 34\) bandages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they added \(50 \times 2 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a bulk pack, which is 25 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the third day, they had \(34 + 100 - 25 = 109\) bandages.

However, the problem states that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means we need to adjust our calculation to match this number. The discrepancy is \(109 - 78 = 31\) bandages, which means they must have started with 31 fewer bandages than our initial calculation.

So, if they ended with 78 bandages after starting with the initial amount and going through the usage and ordering, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Initial bandages} + 100 - 25 - 34 = 78 \]
\[ \text{Initial bandages} + 41 = 78 \]
\[ \text{Initial bandages} = 78 - 41 \]
\[ \text{Initial bandages} = 37 \]

Therefore, they started with 37 bandages on the first day."
"To determine the total cost of May's hair cut and color, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut and the cost of the color separately, and then add them together.

1. The cost of the color is given as $40.
2. The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch. Her hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, which means the length of the hair cut was 10 - 8 = 2 inches. Therefore, the cost of the haircut is 2 inches * $30 per inch = $60.

Adding the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut together, we get:
$40 (color) + $60 (haircut) = $100.

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate Jen's earnings for April, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Jen works in April.
2. Calculate her earnings from her hourly rate.
3. Add the additional $10 for complete attendance.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Jen works in April.**

Jen works 7.5 hours a day and 6 days a week. There are 4 weeks in April.

Total hours in April = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks
Total hours in April = 180 hours

**Step 2: Calculate her earnings from her hourly rate.**

Jen's hourly rate is $1.5.

Earnings from hourly rate = 180 hours * $1.5/hour
Earnings from hourly rate = $270

**Step 3: Add the additional $10 for complete attendance.**

Since Jen did not incur any absences, she receives the additional $10.

Total earnings = Earnings from hourly rate + Additional amount for complete attendance
Total earnings = $270 + $10
Total earnings = $280

**Final numerical answer:**

4. For taking the trash to the curb: $0.75 per time, and he did it twice.
   - $0.75 * 2 = $1.50

Now, we add all these amounts together to find the total amount Jason earned:

- $3.00 (dishwasher) + $3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (cleaning room) + $1.50 (trash) = $9.00

Therefore, Jason earned a total of $9.00 in a two-week period."
"Each whale has 40 gallons of blood. A shark has three times as much blood as a whale, so a shark has:

\[ 40 \text{ gallons} \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

If we have ten sharks, the total amount of blood for ten sharks would be:

\[ 120 \text{ gallons/shark} \times 10 \text{ sharks} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

1200 gallons"
"To calculate the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up the number of people who entered at different times.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant, which is 3 * 50 = 150 people.

Now, we add all these numbers together:

50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) + 80 (after 10:00) + 150 (evening) = 320

The total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack contains 5 pens, the total number of red pens is:

5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens

She also bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. So, the number of black pens is:

2 * 25 red pens = 50 black pens

To find the total number of pens, we add the number of red pens and black pens together:

25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens

Therefore, Alain has 75 pens."
"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles for $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Next, John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, which means he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The cost of cognac per bottle is 50% more than the cost of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ 60 + (0.5 \times 60) = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 20 bottles of cognac:

\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount spent:

\[ 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount John spends on everything is:

\[ \boxed{2400} \]"
"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted:
- 20 White Oak trees
- Twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees

On the second day, he planted:
- 10 more White Oak trees than the first day, which is 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees
- 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 40 + (1/4 * 40) = 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days:
- Total White Oak trees: 20 (first day) + 30 (second day) = 50 White Oak trees
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90 Lodgepole Pine trees

Adding these together gives the total number of trees planted:
- Total trees = 50 (White Oak) + 90 (Lodgepole Pine) = 140 trees

Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 140."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Fred initially made 24 gallons of root beer.
2. His children drank 4 gallons, leaving 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.
3. His wife spilled 7 gallons, leaving 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.
4. His friend Ronnie took 5 gallons, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people (including Fred) showed up for the party. The remaining root beer is 8 gallons, which will be shared equally among the 3 people.

To find out how much each person gets, we divide the remaining root beer by the number of people:

8 gallons / 3 people = 8/3 gallons per person

So, each person gets 8/3 gallons of root beer, which is approximately 2.67 gallons.

The final numerical answer is:
8/3 gallons or approximately 2.67 gallons per person."
"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \( 8 \).

Final numerical answer:
8"
"To find the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes, we can break down the problem into steps:

1. Calculate the number of fish with red stripes.
2. Calculate the number of remaining fish after removing the fish with red stripes.
3. Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish.
4. Add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes to get the final answer.

Step 1: Calculate the number of fish with red stripes.
One-third of the fish have red stripes. So, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]
So, there are 22 fish with red stripes.

Step 2: Calculate the number of remaining fish after removing the fish with red stripes.
\[ 66 - 22 = 44 \]
So, there are 44 fish remaining.

Step 3: Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish.
Five-elevenths of the remaining fish have blue stripes. So, we calculate:
\[ \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \]
So, there are 20 fish with blue stripes.

Step 4: Add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes to get the final answer.
\[ 22 + 20 = 42 \]

Therefore, the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 42."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Amy originally had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so that's \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
2. She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so that's \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.
3. In total, before any theft or usage, Amy had \(8 + 18 = 26\) eyeshadow colors.

Now, let's account for the changes:

4. Her sister steals one of the palettes, which had 4 colors. So, \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors left.
5. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each set has 6 colors, half of that is \(6 / 2 = 3\) colors. So, she uses 3 colors from one set, leaving \(18 - 3 = 15\) colors from that set.
6. Adding the remaining colors from the other two sets, we have \(15 + 4 = 19\) colors from the makeup sets.
7. Adding the remaining palette, we have \(19 + 4 = 22\) colors in total.

So, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is 22."
"Mattison is 60 inches tall.

The height of the two-story house is 7 times Mattison's height:
\[ 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The floor to ceiling height on the first floor is thrice Mattison's height:
\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we subtract the first floor's ceiling height from the total height of the house:
\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:
\[ 240 \text{ inches} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many shells team Alphas found. Since they found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

So, team Alphas found 280 shells. This leaves:

\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \]

shells for the other two teams to find.

Next, team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

So, team The finders found 252 shells. This leaves:

\[ 420 - 252 = 168 \]

shells for team Gogetters.

Therefore, team Gogetters found 168 shells."
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

First, we know the total number of dogs is 4, and the average miles walked per day is 3 miles. Therefore, the total miles walked by all dogs combined is:

\[ 4 \text{ dogs} \times 3 \text{ miles/dog} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the miles walked by the first three dogs:
- The first dog walks 1 mile.
- The second dog walks 4 miles.
- The third dog walks 3 miles.

Adding these up gives:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day."
"First, we calculate the amount of the loan John gets by taking 40% of the value of his house:

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, we determine how much of the loan he uses to pay off his debts by taking 60% of the loan amount:

\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Finally, we subtract the amount used to pay debts from the total loan amount to find out how much money he has leftover:

\[ \text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

Therefore, the amount of money John had leftover after paying his debts is:

\[ 40,000 \]"
"To find out how much Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught. 

The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms, the second tuna weighs 46 kilograms, and the last tuna weighs 26 kilograms. Adding these weights together:

\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings from selling 128 kilograms of tuna at a rate of $0.50 per kilogram:

\[ 128 \times 0.50 = 64 \]

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To find Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines. She sells them at 11/8 of the price she bought them for. Given that she bought the magazines at $72, we can calculate the selling price as follows:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11 \times 72}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{792}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the buying price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting = 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.

2. **Medium setting:**
   - Removes twice as much as the low setting, so it removes 2 liters per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting = 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.

3. **High setting:**
   - Removes twice as much as the medium setting, so it removes 4 liters per day.
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on high setting = 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Now, we sum the water removed at each setting:
- Total water removed = 3 liters (low) + 6 liters (medium) + 20 liters (high) = 29 liters.

The total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."
"To find out how many balloons Jolene and her friends threw, we first need to calculate the total number of balloons they started with and then subtract the number of balloons left at the end of the afternoon.

1. Calculate the total number of balloons:
   - They filled up 10 packs of balloons, with 30 balloons per pack.
   - Total balloons = 10 packs * 30 balloons/pack = 300 balloons.

2. Calculate the number of balloons thrown:
   - By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons were left.
   - Balloons thrown = Total balloons - Balloons left = 300 - 12 = 288 balloons.

Therefore, they threw 288 balloons."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to determine the total amount of medicine for one dose.
2. For one dose, Saanvi combines 14 mL of the first medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine.
3. The amount of the second medicine for one dose is 3 * 14 mL = 42 mL.
4. Therefore, the total amount of medicine for one dose is 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL.
5. To find the total amount of medicine for 8 doses, we multiply the amount for one dose by 8.
6. So, 56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

The total amount of medicine in 8 doses is 448 mL."
"First, let's determine the capacity of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, we can calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[ \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:

\[ \text{Total capacity of John's school} = 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, we know the capacity of Ali's class is 120 students. Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is:

\[ \text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students} \]

The combined capacity of both schools is 150 students."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen will owe his sister including the 2% interest.

The principal amount Stephen borrowed is $300. The interest is 2% of $300, which is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen will owe is:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} = 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in 11 months is:

\[ \text{Total Paid in 11 Months} = 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he has already paid from the total amount he owes:

\[ \text{Amount to be Paid in the Twelfth Month} = 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month."
"Jordan has 2 children, and each child requires 5 diaper changes per day. So, the total number of diaper changes per day for both children is:

\[ 2 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ diaper changes/child} = 10 \text{ diaper changes/day} \]

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so she changes:

\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ diaper changes/day} \]

Therefore, Jordan changes the other half, which is:

\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ diaper changes/day} \]

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day."
"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the jar.
2. Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans, considering the packing efficiency.
3. Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.
4. Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans.
5. Compare Tim's guess to the true number of red jelly beans.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.**

The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall. The volume \( V \) of the jar is given by:
\[ V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans.**

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume \( V_{\text{eff}} \) is:
\[ V_{\text{eff}} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 3: Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.**

Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches. The total number of jelly beans \( N \) that can fit in the jar is:
\[ N = \frac{V_{\text{eff}}}{\text{volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans.**

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red. Therefore, the estimated number of red jelly beans \( N_{\text{red}} \) is:
\[ N_{\text{red}} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

**Step 5: Compare Tim's guess to the true number of red jelly beans.**

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between Tim's guess and the true number is:
\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

Therefore, Tim's guess was 36 jelly beans off."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the bus had 20 people on board.
2. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the number of people on the bus is now:
   \[20 + 40 = 60\]
3. At the second stop, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who entered at the first stop entered again. So, the number of people who entered at the second stop is:
   \[\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30\]
   Therefore, the number of people on the bus is now:
   \[60 + 30 = 90\]
4. At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the number of people on the bus is now:
   \[90 \times 2 = 180\]
5. The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find out how many more people are needed to fill the bus, we subtract the current number of people on the bus from the bus's capacity:
   \[200 - 180 = 20\]

The total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is:
\[20\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of visits Pauline made in the first 5 years. Since she visits the museum three times a year, the total number of visits in 5 years is:

\[ 3 \text{ visits/year} \times 5 \text{ years} = 15 \text{ visits} \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of one visit after the increase. The original cost of one visit is $2, and it increased by 150%. An increase of 150% means the cost is multiplied by 2.5 (since 150% is 1.5 times the original cost, and the original cost is 1, so 1 + 1.5 = 2.5):

\[ 2 \times 2.5 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Pauline continued to visit the museum for 3 more years at the new cost. The number of visits in these 3 years is:

\[ 3 \text{ visits/year} \times 3 \text{ years} = 9 \text{ visits} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 9 visits at the new price:

\[ 9 \text{ visits} \times 5 \text{ dollars/visit} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the visits in the first 5 years to the cost of the visits in the next 3 years. The cost for the first 5 years is:

\[ 15 \text{ visits} \times 2 \text{ dollars/visit} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is:

\[ 30 \text{ dollars} + 45 \text{ dollars} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 75 \]"
"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students who can try the escape room.
2. Determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed.
3. Calculate the total time required for all groups to try the escape room.

First, we know that there are 10 students in each of the 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th) who can try the escape room. So, the total number of students is:
\[ 10 \text{ students/grade} \times 4 \text{ grades} = 40 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed from these 40 students:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students/group}} = 5 \text{ groups} \]

Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room. Therefore, the total time required for all groups to try the escape room is:
\[ 5 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 225 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is:
\[ \boxed{225 \text{ minutes}} \]"
"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the wooden tables and the roof frames separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the wooden tables:
- John made 4 wooden tables.
- Each table costs $20.
- Therefore, the total cost for the wooden tables is \(4 \times 20 = 80\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the roof frames:
- John made 2 roof frames.
- Each roof frame costs $10.
- Therefore, the total cost for the roof frames is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the wooden tables and the roof frames to find the total amount Ali has to pay:
- Total cost = Cost of wooden tables + Cost of roof frames
- Total cost = \(80 + 20 = 100\) dollars.

Therefore, Ali has to pay John \(\boxed{100}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we calculate its length as:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine how much of the secret steakhouse seasoning Aiden will need, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of ground beef needed:**
   - Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef.
   - He wants to make 80 meatballs.
   - Therefore, the amount of ground beef needed is \( \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds of ground beef} \).

2. **Calculate the amount of secret seasoning needed:**
   - Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for every pound of ground beef.
   - Since he needs 5 pounds of ground beef, the amount of secret seasoning needed is \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \).

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning to make 80 meatballs."
"First, we need to calculate the total width of the windows. Since there are five windows and each window is 35 inches wide, we multiply the number of windows by the width of each window:

\[ 5 \times 35 = 175 \text{ inches} \]

Next, Luke needs fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. So, we multiply the total width by 2:

\[ 175 \times 2 = 350 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining minutes.

1. For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute:
   \[
   16 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.25/\text{minute} = \$4.00
   \]

2. For the remaining minutes (36 - 16 = 20 minutes), the cost is $0.20 per minute:
   \[
   20 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.20/\text{minute} = \$4.00
   \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost:
\[
\$4.00 + \$4.00 = \$8.00

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly makes as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be written as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

The total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is the sum of the number of cupcakes and the number of brownies. Since each of the 5 people in the class gets 2 treats, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

So, we have:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]
\[ C = 3 \]

Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted price for both a manicure and a pedicure.
2. Calculate the cost of adding nail art to each set of nails.
3. Sum up all the costs to find the total amount Karen would pay.

### Step 1: Calculate the discounted price for both a manicure and a pedicure
- The original price for a manicure is $35.
- The original price for a pedicure is $40.
- The discount is 20%.

The discount amount for the manicure is:
\[ 35 \times 0.20 = 7 \]

So, the discounted price for the manicure is:
\[ 35 - 7 = 28 \]

The discount amount for the pedicure is:
\[ 40 \times 0.20 = 8 \]

So, the discounted price for the pedicure is:
\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \]

The total discounted price for both a manicure and a pedicure is:
\[ 28 + 32 = 60 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of adding nail art to each set of nails

### Step 3: Sum up all the costs
The total amount Karen would pay is the sum of the discounted price for both services and the cost of nail art:
\[ 60 + 60 = 120 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To find out how many magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the total number of issues from each magazine and then sum them up.

1. For the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year each:
   \[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ issues} \]

2. For the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
   \[ 6 \text{ issues} \]

3. For the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
   \[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ issues} \]

Now, we sum up all the issues:
\[ 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 \text{ issues} \]

So, Susan gets a total of 66 issues every year. However, the question asks for the number of magazines, not the number of issues. We need to count the number of magazines:

- 3 magazines that send 12 issues each
- 1 magazine that sends 6 issues
- 1 magazine that sends 24 issues

Therefore, the total number of magazines is:
\[ 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 5 \]"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up the relationships between the number of paintings each person has.

1. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as \( K \).
2. According to the problem, Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, so Shelley has \( K + 8 \) paintings.
3. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and we know Samantha has 27 paintings. So, we can write the equation for Samantha's paintings as \( (K + 8) - 12 = 27 \).

Now, let's solve for \( K \):

\[
(K + 8) - 12 = 27
\]

Simplify the left side:

\[
K + 8 - 12 = 27
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
K - 4 = 27
\]

Add 4 to both sides to solve for \( K \):

\[
K = 27 + 4
\]

\[
K = 31
\]

So, Kim has 31 paintings.

Kim has 31 paintings."
"To find the final price of the toy after the changes in November, December, and January, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Price in November**: $40

2. **Price Increase in December**: The price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.
   - 80% of $40 = 0.80 * $40 = $32
   - New price in December = $40 + $32 = $72

3. **Price Decrease in January**: The price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.
   - 50% of $72 = 0.50 * $72 = $36
   - Final price in January = $72 - $36 = $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"First, let's calculate the amount Charlie makes from the 4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour.

\[ 4 \text{ lessons} \times \$80 \text{ per lesson} = \$320 \]

Next, we need to determine the reduced rate for lessons with a veteran. Since the rate is reduced by 25%, we calculate 25% of $80 and subtract it from the standard rate.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$80 = 0.25 \times \$80 = \$20 \]

So, the reduced rate is:

\[ \$80 - \$20 = \$60 \]

Now, we calculate the amount Charlie makes from the 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran at the reduced rate of $60 per hour.

\[ 2 \text{ lessons} \times \$60 \text{ per lesson} = \$120 \]

Finally, we add the amounts from both types of lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make for the day.

\[ \$320 + \$120 = \$440 \]

The total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."

Eve gave away 15 pomelos."
"First, let's calculate how many apples Walter ate. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 apples:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, let's find out how many apples he had left after eating:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Next, Walter gave 25% of the remaining apples to his sister. To find out how many apples that is, we calculate 25% of 36:

\[ 0.25 \times 36 = 9 \]

So, Walter gave 9 apples to his sister. Now, let's find out how many apples he had left after giving some to his sister:

\[ 36 - 9 = 27 \]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple:

\[ 27 \times 3 = 81 \]

Therefore, Walter received $81."
"To find out how many novels Regina has written this year, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( x \) be the number of novels Regina has written this year. According to the problem, 9 novels are 3 quarters (or 3/4) of the number of novels she has written this year. This can be written as:

\[ \frac{3}{4}x = 9 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{3}{4} \), which is \( \frac{4}{3} \):

\[ x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

\[ x = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

"To determine the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days. Since Michael travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we need to know how many hours he travels in 3 days. Assuming he travels 24 hours a day (excluding any stops), the total travel time in 3 days is:

\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the total distance Michael travels in 72 hours:

\[ 72 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ km/hr} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the 6000 km distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered. We do this by dividing the distance Michael has traveled by the total distance and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:

\[ \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered is:

\[ \boxed{60\%} \]"
"First, let's determine how many grapes Madeline's brother used to make the grape juice. Since he used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, and Madeline ate 6 grapes, we calculate:

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many grapes were used to make the 4 pies. Since each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes, we calculate:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

Now, we add up all the grapes used:

\[ 6 \text{ (Madeline's grapes)} + 30 \text{ (brother's grapes)} + 48 \text{ (grapes for pies)} = 84 \text{ grapes} \]

Therefore, the total number of grapes at the beginning was:

"To determine the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.
2. Determine the total available time in minutes for the custodian over 5 days.
3. Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.
4. Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.**

Time per classroom = 15 minutes
Number of classrooms = 80

Total time required = 15 minutes/classroom * 80 classrooms = 1200 minutes

**Step 2: Determine the total available time in minutes for the custodian over 5 days.**

Working hours per day = 8 hours
Minutes per hour = 60 minutes

Total available time per day = 8 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/day

Total available time over 5 days = 480 minutes/day * 5 days = 2400 minutes

**Step 3: Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.**

Total time required = 1200 minutes
Total available time over 5 days = 2400 minutes

Average time spent cleaning per day = 1200 minutes / 5 days = 240 minutes/day

**Step 4: Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.**

Average time spent cleaning per day = 240 minutes
Total available time per day = 480 minutes

Percentage of the day spent cleaning = (240 minutes / 480 minutes) * 100% = 50%

"To determine how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to calculate the total capacity of one bookcase.

1. Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, we add up the capacity of all the shelves in one bookcase:
- Middle shelves: \(10 + 10 = 20\) books
- Bottom shelf: \(20\) books
- Top shelf: \(15\) books

Total capacity of one bookcase:
\[20 + 20 + 15 = 55 \text{ books}\]

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

Therefore, Elly needs \(\boxed{2}\) bookcases to hold all of her books."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's determine how many eggs Rose has in total. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's calculate how much Rose will earn by selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs. Therefore, the number of sets of 3 eggs in 60 eggs is:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. So, we can write:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break down the time taken for each side of the Rubik's cube:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice the time of the first side, so each of these takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. The last two sides each take half the time of the first side, so each of these takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.
4. The sixth side is not specified, but since the problem states ""once you get the 5th side you have all 6 sides,"" we can assume the sixth side is included in the total time.

Now, let's add up the time for all six sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes
- Sixth side: 2.5 minutes (assuming it's included in the total time as per the problem statement)

Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish."
"To determine the total amount of water Crista needs for her plants every day, we can break down the problem into parts based on the different watering requirements for the plants.

1. **Plants needing half a cup of water:**
   - There are 4 plants.
   - Each plant needs 0.5 cups of water.
   - Total water for these plants = 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups.

2. **Plants needing 1 cup of water:**
   - There are 8 plants.
   - Each plant needs 1 cup of water.
   - Total water for these plants = 8 * 1 = 8 cups.

3. **Plants needing a quarter of a cup of water:**
   - Total number of plants = 20.
   - Plants needing half a cup and 1 cup of water = 4 + 8 = 12.
   - Therefore, the number of plants needing a quarter of a cup of water = 20 - 12 = 8.
   - Each of these 8 plants needs 0.25 cups of water.
   - Total water for these plants = 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Now, we add up the total water needed for all the plants:
- Total water = 2 cups (for half a cup plants) + 8 cups (for 1 cup plants) + 2 cups (for quarter a cup plants) = 12 cups.

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To return home, Phineas Frog needs to cover a total distance of 200 yards. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, he will cover 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop on land:
- Speed on land = 20 yards per minute
- Distance on land = 100 yards
- Time on land = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to swim in water:
- Speed in water = 10 yards per minute
- Distance in water = 100 yards
- Time in water = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Finally, we add the time spent on land and in water to find the total time:
- Total time = Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

Therefore, it will take Phineas Frog 15 minutes to return home."

Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since 1 dozen equals 12 doughnuts, the total number of doughnuts made in a day is:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ doughnuts} \]

Step 2: Determine the number of days in June.
June has 30 days.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
\[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

Step 4: Calculate the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts in June.
Derrick sells each doughnut for $2. Therefore, the total revenue is:
\[ 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \times \$2/\text{doughnut} = \$7200 \]

Therefore, Derrick makes \(\$7200\) in June if he sells all the doughnuts."
"Jade takes 7 photos in one batch and uploads 6 batches each day. So, the number of photos she uploads each day is:

\[ 7 \text{ photos/batch} \times 6 \text{ batches/day} = 42 \text{ photos/day} \]

She has a total of 210 photos to upload. To find out how many days she will need to upload all her photos, we divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads each day:

\[ \frac{210 \text{ photos}}{42 \text{ photos/day}} = 5 \text{ days} \]

So, she will need 5 days to upload all of her photos."
"To calculate the total amount Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks, we need to first determine the cost for one week and then multiply that by 5.

1. Cost for blouses in one week: 5 blouses * $5.00 per blouse = $25.00
2. Cost for pants in one week: 2 pants * $8.00 per pair of pants = $16.00
3. Cost for skirts in one week: 1 skirt * $6.00 per skirt = $6.00

Now, we add these amounts to find the total cost for one week:
$25.00 (blouses) + $16.00 (pants) + $6.00 (skirts) = $47.00

To find the total cost for 5 weeks, we multiply the weekly cost by 5:
$47.00 * 5 = $235.00

Therefore, Alicia spends $235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed after training. His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster:

\[ 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of words John needs to speak. Each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages:

\[ 450 \, \text{words/page} \times 10 \, \text{pages} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we can calculate the time it would take for John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. The time is calculated by dividing the total number of words by his speaking speed:

\[ \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speed."
"On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day, so:
50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so:
2 * 70 = 140 people.

For the rest of the week (days 4, 5, 6, and 7), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Since there are 4 days, the total number of people he saw on these days is:
4 * 60 = 240 people.

Now, to find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we add the number of people from each day:
50 (first day) + 70 (second day) + 140 (third day) + 240 (remaining days) = 500 people.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 500."
"Let's break down the popping process step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds:** 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds:** The popping rate triples, so \(20 \times 3 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Following 30 seconds:** The popping rate quadruples, so \(20 \times 4 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds:** The popping rate is halved from the previous 30 seconds, so \(80 \div 2 = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, let's add up the number of kernels that popped in the first four 30-second intervals:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\]

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. So, a quarter of 40 kernels pop:
\[40 \div 4 = 10\]

Adding these to the total number of popped kernels:
\[200 + 10 = 210\]

Therefore, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:
\[210\]"
"To determine how many lemons Tim will need, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount of lemonade needed:**
   - Tim needs 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.
   - Allen asked for an extra gallon that is twice as tart, which means it will have the same amount of lemon juice as a regular gallon but will be more concentrated.
   - Therefore, Tim needs 4 gallons + 1 gallon = 5 gallons of lemonade in total.

2. **Determine the amount of lemon juice needed:**
   - For 1 gallon of lemonade, Tim needs 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.
   - For 5 gallons of lemonade, he will need 5 cups of lemon juice.

3. **Calculate the number of lemons needed:**
   - 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
   - To get 5 cups of juice, Tim will need 5 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 30 lemons.

Therefore, Tim will need 30 lemons."

2. Calculate the total number of legs from the 4-legged animals:
   - 15 animals × 4 legs/animal = 60 legs

3. Add the legs from both types of animals to get the total number of legs:
   - 20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

4. Divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the number of pairs:
   - 80 legs ÷ 2 = 40 pairs

The total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 40."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know there are 4 blue blocks.
2. There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, so there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) yellow blocks.
3. Let the number of red blocks be \(R\).

The total number of blocks in the tower is the sum of the blue, yellow, and red blocks, which is given as 32. So, we can write the equation:

\[4 \text{ (blue)} + 8 \text{ (yellow)} + R \text{ (red)} = 32\]

Now, we can solve for \(R\):

\[4 + 8 + R = 32\]
\[12 + R = 32\]
\[R = 32 - 12\]
\[R = 20\]

So, there are 20 red blocks in the tower.

   - Distance traveled east: 144 miles
   - Net distance = Distance east - Distance west = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Elvis is now 54 miles from his house."
"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and apply it to the boat's value step by step.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - Initial value: $9000
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700 \)
   - Value after first year: \( 9000 - 2700 = 6300 \)

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the second year: $6300
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890 \)
   - Value after second year: \( 6300 - 1890 = 4410 \)

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the third year: $4410
   - Depreciation rate: 20%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 4410 \times 0.20 = 882 \)
   - Value after third year: \( 4410 - 882 = 3528 \)

The boat is worth $3528 after the three years."
"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to determine the quantities of the other colored candies.

1. Red candies: 54
2. Orange candies: Twice the amount of red candies, so \(2 \times 54 = 108\)
3. Yellow candies: Half as many as red candies, so \(\frac{54}{2} = 27\)

Now, we add up the red, orange, and yellow candies:
\[54 + 108 + 27 = 189\]

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
\[232 - 189 = 43\]

Therefore, the number of pink candies is 43."
"To find out how much Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost for each and then add them together.

1. **Hotel Cost:**
   - Helen booked a hotel for 3 nights.
   - The cost for one night is $80.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the hotel is \(3 \times 80 = 240\) dollars.

2. **Bus Travel Cost:**
   - Helen rode the bus 7 times.
   - Each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel.
   - The cost of one bus trip is \(80 \times 0.10 = 8\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the bus travels is \(7 \times 8 = 56\) dollars.

3. **Total Cost:**

"Mazie initially has 52 marbles. Dallas ends up with 21 marbles after dropping 4, which means before dropping the marbles, Dallas had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles.

Since Mazie gave all her marbles to Dallas and Darla, and Dallas received 25 marbles, the remaining marbles were given to Darla.

So, the number of marbles given to Darla is 52 - 25 = 27.

Therefore, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets and the popcorns separately and then add them together.

1. The cost of the adult tickets: Since there are 2 parents, the cost is \(2 \times \$12 = \$24\).
2. The cost of the child ticket: There is 1 child, so the cost is \(1 \times \$8 = \$8\).
3. The cost of the popcorns: They buy 2 popcorns at $3 each, so the cost is \(2 \times \$3 = \$6\).

Now, we add these amounts together to get the total cost:
\[ \$24 + \$8 + \$6 = \$38 \]

Therefore, the total amount they pay is \$38."
"First, we need to calculate the total weight of the car, luggage, and children. 

The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and each child weighs 75 pounds. Since there are two children, we add the weight of both children together:

\[ 75 \text{ pounds/child} \times 2 \text{ children} = 150 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add all these weights together:

\[ 1200 \text{ pounds} + 250 \text{ pounds} + 150 \text{ pounds} = 1600 \text{ pounds} \]

The force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we calculate:

\[ 1600 \text{ pounds} \times 0.01 = 16 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the force John needs to push the car is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the daily feed consumption for one pig:**
   Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day. So, the daily feed consumption for one pig is:
   \[
   4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the daily feed consumption for all five pigs:**
   Since Dexter has five pigs, the total daily feed consumption is:
   \[
   8 \text{ pounds/day/pig} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weekly feed consumption for all five pigs:**
   There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly feed consumption is:
   \[
   40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 280 \text{ pounds/week}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining feed after a week:**
   Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. After a week, the remaining feed is:
   \[
   300 \text{ pounds} - 280 \text{ pounds} = 20 \text{ pounds}

"First, let's calculate the total number of hot dogs needed for the party. John invited 20 people, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. So, the total number of hot dogs required is:

\[ 20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many more hot dogs John needs to buy, considering he already has 4 hot dogs left over. So, the number of additional hot dogs needed is:

\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Since each pack contains 6 hot dogs, the number of packs required is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pack costs $2, so the total cost for 6 packs is:

\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs."

- Ellen also bought a photo frame for $5.
So, Ellen's total is $100 + $5 = $105.

Next, let's calculate the total amount Lani spent:
- Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30.
- Lani also bought two bathrobes, each costing $100, so the total for the bathrobes is $100 + $100 = $200.
So, Lani's total is $30 + $200 = $230.

Now, we add Ellen's total and Lani's total to find the overall amount spent:
- Ellen's total: $105
- Lani's total: $230
So, the total amount spent by both is $105 + $230 = $335.

Therefore, Ellen and Lani spent a total of $335."
"To calculate the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of the honey and jam mix, we need to first determine the cost of ingredients for one jar and then calculate the total cost for 10 jars. After that, we'll subtract the total cost from the revenue generated by selling 10 jars.

### Cost of Ingredients for One Jar

- **Passion Fruit**: 2 pounds at $6 per pound
  \[
  2 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$12
  \]

- **Jackfruit**: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound
  \[
  1.5 \text{ pounds} \times \$8/\text{pound} = \$12
  \]

- **Special Honey**: 2 pounds at $10 per pound
  \[
  2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10/\text{pound} = \$20
  \]

### Total Cost for One Jar
\[
\$12 + \$12 + \$20 = \$44
\]

### Total Cost for 10 Jars
\[
10 \text{ jars} \times \$44/\text{jar} = \$440
\]

### Revenue from Selling 10 Jars
\[
10 \text{ jars} \times \$50/\text{jar} = \$500
\]

### Profit Calculation
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}
\]
\[
\text{Profit} = \$500 - \$440 = \$60
\]

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{\$60}

"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to convert each type of coin to its dollar value and then sum these values.

1. **Quarters**: Each quarter is worth $0.25. Justin has 32 quarters.
   \[
   32 \times 0.25 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth $0.10. Justin has 95 dimes.
   \[
   95 \times 0.10 = 9.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth $0.05. Justin has 120 nickels.
   \[
   120 \times 0.05 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth $0.01. Justin has 750 pennies.
   \[
   750 \times 0.01 = 7.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add up all the dollar amounts:
\[
8 + 9.50 + 6 + 7.50 = 31 \text{ dollars}
\]

The total dollar amount in the jar is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"To find out how much money Janet has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and then subtract that from the $40 her parents gave her.

First, let's add up her expenses:
- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets (2 tickets at $7.50 each): $7.50 * 2 = $15.00
- Bracelet: $8.50

Total spent = $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00

Now, subtract the total spent from the $40 she was given:
$40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00

Janet has $13.00 left."
"Josh is open 5 days a week (Monday through Saturday). In 2 weeks, he would be open for \(5 \times 2 = 10\) days. He services 3 cars a day, so in 10 days, he services \(3 \times 10 = 30\) cars. Since he gets paid $4 per car, his total earnings in 2 weeks would be \(30 \times 4 = 120\).

Therefore, Josh makes $120 in 2 weeks."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, Randy has:
   - 9 oatmeal cookies
   - 4 chocolate chip cookies
   - 5 sugar cookies

2. Randy ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor:
   - Oatmeal: 9 - 1 = 8
   - Chocolate chip: 4 - 1 = 3
   - Sugar: 5 - 1 = 4

3. He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
   - Oatmeal: 8 - 2 = 6

4. He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
   - Sugar: 4 - 2 = 2

5. He bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner:
   - Oatmeal: 6 + 4 = 10
   - Chocolate chip: 3 + 4 = 7
   - Sugar: 2 + 4 = 6

Now, let's add up the total number of cookies Randy has:
- Oatmeal: 10
- Chocolate chip: 7
- Sugar: 6

Total cookies = 10 + 7 + 6 = 23

Final numerical answer:

"Matthew has a collection of 12 unique toy soldiers. He would sell half of them for $5 each and the other half for $7 each.

Half of 12 is 6, so he would sell 6 toy soldiers for $5 each and 6 toy soldiers for $7 each.

The money earned from selling 6 toy soldiers at $5 each is:
6 * $5 = $30

The money earned from selling 6 toy soldiers at $7 each is:
6 * $7 = $42

The total money earned would be:
$30 + $42 = $72

Matthew would earn $72."
"First, let's calculate the total number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many holes Nate can fill in a day. Since he fills 9 holes a day and the dog digs 6 holes a day, the net reduction in the number of holes each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes for Nate to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes."
"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School, and Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 \]

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = 3000 \]

Now, to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract the average enrollment of Butler High School from that of Norman High School:

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 4000 - 3000 \]

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 1000 \]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School."
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made: 7995
Rainbow cookies: 2595
Oatmeal cookies: 3075

Now, subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total:

7995 - 2595 - 3075 = 2325

The Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which means Igor gathered \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.
2. Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, which means Igor gathered \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.
3. Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, but some were lost, so let's denote the number of beakers Igor actually brought as \( x \).
4. The total number of items on the lab bench is 29.

We can set up the equation for the total number of items:

\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + x \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 8 + x + 16 = 29 \]
\[ 24 + x = 29 \]
\[ x = 29 - 24 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, Igor brought 5 beakers to the lab bench. Since Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, the number of beakers Igor lost is:

\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of legs for all tables:**
   - Each table has 4 legs.
   - James is putting together 4 tables.
   - Therefore, the total number of legs is \(4 \text{ legs/table} \times 4 \text{ tables} = 16 \text{ legs}\).

2. **Calculate the total number of screws needed:**
   - Each leg needs 2 screws.
   - Therefore, the total number of screws needed is \(16 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 32 \text{ screws}\).

3. **Calculate the number of screws left over:**
   - James has 40 screws.
   - He needs 32 screws.
   - Therefore, the number of screws left over is \(40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws}\).

"There are 10 eggs in the first basket. The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first, so it has 2 * 10 = 20 eggs. 

To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket:

10 + 20 = 30

Therefore, there are 30 eggs in both baskets put together."
"First, let's determine how much each person raised:

- Alexandra raises $430.
- Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.
- Sarah raises $300.
- Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add up the amounts raised by all of them:

- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: $750
- Maryam: $700
- Sarah: $300

Total amount raised = $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180

Therefore, the total amount of money they all raised is $2180."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the distance each ran:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Aaron ran half the distance Vanessa ran, so Aaron ran \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.

2. **Determine the speed of each:**
   - Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, so his speed was \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute} \).
   - Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, so Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute} \).

3. **Calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:**
   - Since Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute} \), the time she took to run 4 miles is \( 4 \text{ miles} \div \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ minutes} \).

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race."
"To determine how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line needed for the 200 feet of dock.
2. Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total needed.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of line needed.
Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total line needed is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Step 2: Subtract the amount of line he already has.
He already has 6 feet of new line, so the amount he needs to buy is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, he needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To calculate how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of meals and wine per night.
2. Determine the total cost per night.
3. Calculate the total for the days the restaurant is open in a week.

First, let's calculate the cost per night:
- They order 2 meals at $5 each, so the cost of the meals is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars.
- They also order a $5 bottle of wine.
- Therefore, the total cost per night is \(10 + 5 = 15\) dollars.

Next, we need to find out how much they make in a week. Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, we multiply the daily cost by 2:
- The total weekly cost is \(15 \times 2 = 30\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost price per watermelon.
2. Determine the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost price per watermelon.**

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. So, the cost price per watermelon is:
\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \]

**Step 2: Determine the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit.**

A 25% profit means the selling price is 125% of the cost price. So, the selling price per watermelon is:
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 1.25 = 2.00 \]

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00."
"First, let's determine Dora's current age. If Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

James is twice as old as Dora, so James is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.

Now, we need to find out how old John was when James was born. Since John was 32 when his son James was born, and James is currently 18, John is currently 32 + 18 = 50 years old.

The question asks for the age of John's youngest son in 3 years. Since the youngest son was born when John was 32, and we are not given any information about the youngest son's current age, we can assume the question is referring to James, as he is the only son mentioned in the context of John's age at birth.

So, in 3 years, James will be 18 + 3 = 21 years old.

   - Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

2. **Calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour:**
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

3. **Find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:**
   - Ana peels 20 oranges in an hour.
   - Jane peels 15 oranges in an hour.
   - The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost is $400, and he gets it at 80% off.

The discount amount is:
\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

So, the cost of the radiator after the discount is:
\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost for the mechanic's labor. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

The labor cost is:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total amount Mark paid:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is:
\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of equations. Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( 2C + 4K = 70 \) (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To eliminate \( C \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 20 - 15 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.

Final numerical answer:

"First, we need to determine the total number of pizza slices available. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices as follows:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends. This means the slices need to be divided among 4 people:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices of pizza."
