"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and uses 4 for baking muffins for her friends. So, the total number of eggs used by Janet is:

3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for baking) = 7 eggs

The remainder of the eggs that she sells at the farmers' market is:

16 (total eggs) - 7 (used eggs) = 9 eggs

She sells each egg for $2, so the amount she makes from selling the eggs is:

9 (eggs) * $2 (per egg) = $18

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber, which means it takes 1 bolt of white fiber (since half of 2 is 1).

"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repairs) from the new value to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. This means the value of the house increased by 1.5 times its original value.

The original value of the house is $80,000. So, the increase in value due to repairs is:
\[ 80,000 \times 1.5 = 120,000 \]

Adding this increase to the original value gives us the new value of the house:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost Josh incurred, which is the sum of the purchase price and the repair costs:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, Josh made a profit of:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. He does this 3 times a week. 

First, calculate the total distance he runs in one session:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters

Then, calculate the total distance he runs in a week:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters

So, the total meters James runs a week is 540 meters."
"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken consumes in a day.
2. Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon.
3. Subtract the total morning and afternoon feed from the daily feed requirement to find the amount needed for the final meal.

First, we know each chicken consumes 3 cups of feed per day. With 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we know the chickens are given 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. The total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the morning and afternoon feed from the total daily requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens \(\boxed{20}\) cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of 16 glasses, considering that every second glass is 60% of the regular price.

1. The cost of the first glass is $5.
2. The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = $3\).

This pattern continues, so for every pair of glasses, the total cost is $5 (first glass) + $3 (second glass) = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide 16 by 2 to find out how many pairs of glasses he is buying: \(16 \div 2 = 8\) pairs.

Now, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost of each pair: \(8 \times 8 = $64\).

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

$64"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sheep each city has based on the given relationships and then sum them up.

1. Let's start with the number of sheep in Seattle. According to the problem, Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So, the number of sheep in Charleston is \(4 \times 20 = 80\).
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, the number of sheep in Toulouse is \(2 \times 80 = 160\).

Now, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together:
\[ 160 + 80 + 20 = 260 \]

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 260."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. Calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the file.
2. Add the 20 minutes for the Windows update installation.
3. Calculate the time to download the remaining 60% of the file.
4. Sum up all the times to get the total download time.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Time to download 40% of the file:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \(0.40 \times 200 = 80\) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \(80 \div 2 = 40\) minutes.

2. **Time for the Windows update installation:**
   - This is given as 20 minutes.

3. **Time to download the remaining 60% of the file:**
   - 60% of 200 GB is \(0.60 \times 200 = 120\) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \(120 \div 2 = 60\) minutes.

4. **Total time:**
   - Total time = Time to download 40% + Time for Windows update + Time to download 60%
   - Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is 120 minutes."
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he has traveled and then subtract the distance he has covered from the initial distance to his home.

1. **Initial Trip to the Turnaround Point:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John drives for 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered.
   - He then drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - He then drives for the remaining 1.5 hours (4 hours total - 2 hours in traffic - 0.5 hours at 30 mph) at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Covered on the Return Trip:**
   - Total distance = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - Initial distance to home = 180 miles.
   - Distance covered on the return trip = 135 miles.
   - Distance from home = Initial distance - Distance covered = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

**Final Answer:**
John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours."

1. **Regular Hours**: Eliza works 40 hours at her regular rate of $10 per hour.
2. **Overtime Hours**: Eliza worked 5 hours of overtime (45 total hours - 40 regular hours).

**Regular Earnings Calculation**:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

**Overtime Rate Calculation**:
\[ 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]

**Overtime Earnings Calculation**:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

**Total Earnings**:
\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

Eliza's earnings for this week are \$460."
"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, which is:
\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \]

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, so the program had 70% of the second month's downloads:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

The program had a total of 366 downloads over the three months."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Each dozen costs $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Each dozen costs $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Each dozen costs $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330.

Now, we sum up the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit becomes positive.

First, let's break down the costs and revenues:

1. **Initial Cost**: $90 (cost to plant the tree)
2. **Annual Costs**: $3 (water and feed the tree)
3. **Annual Revenue**: 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5

Now, let's calculate the net profit each year after the initial cost:

- **Net Profit per Year**: $10.5 (revenue) - $3 (cost) = $7.5

To find out how many years it will take to recover the initial cost of $90, we divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:

- **Years to Recover Initial Cost**: $90 / $7.5 = 12 years

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

**12 years**"
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there. This leaves her with \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners.

4. According to the problem, after these sales, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

5. To solve for \( x \), first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]

6. Add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]

7. Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 2x = 36 \]

8. Finally, divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

18"
"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we have:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after the contemporary dance enrollment:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Now, 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

So, the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is the remaining students after contemporary and jazz dance enrollments:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the following calculation:

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100\% = 0.60 \times 100\% = 60\% \]

Therefore, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the expected value of the profit from each purchase after the speculated market increase.

1. **Jewelry Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value after increase: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125
   - Profit: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

2. **Electronic Gadgets Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value after increase: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096
   - Profit: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits:
- Jewelry profit: $125
- Electronic gadgets profit: $96

The merchant should choose the jewelry purchase to maximize profit, as it yields a higher profit of $125.

**Final numerical answer:**
$125"
"Each train travels 80 miles westward and then 150 miles northward over the two days. 

To find the total distance covered by each train, we simply add the distances together:

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her earnings from both her teaching and coaching jobs and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She earns $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
\[ 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} = 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- She earns $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
\[ 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours/week} = 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from coaching are:
\[ 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Finally, we sum up her annual earnings from both jobs to get her total annual salary:
\[ 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} + 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} = 57500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Her annual salary is:
\[ \boxed{57500} \]"
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one week.
3. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Claire eats 3 eggs every day.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she eats:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Step 3: In 4 weeks, she eats:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Step 4: Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert 84 eggs into dozens:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks."
"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time required to cover 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time already spent:**
   \[
   \text{Time spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Determine the remaining time to cover the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining time} = \text{Total time} - \text{Time spent} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - (4 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles}) = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Required speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Remaining time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in both the orange and pineapple drinks, then account for the spill, and finally sum the remaining water.

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the orange drink:**
   - The orange drink is 10 liters, and it is two-thirds water.
   - Amount of water in the orange drink = \(10 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67\) liters.

2. **Calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink:**
   - The pineapple drink is 15 liters, and it is three-fifths water.
   - Amount of water in the pineapple drink = \(15 \times \frac{3}{5} = 9\) liters.

3. **Account for the spill:**
   - We spill 1 liter of the orange drink, which means we lose \(\frac{2}{3} \times 1 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67\) liters of water from the orange drink.
   - Remaining water in the orange drink = \(6.67 - 0.67 = 6\) liters.

4. **Calculate the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters:**
   - Total water = Water from the remaining orange drink + Water from the pineapple drink
   - Total water = \(6 + 9 = 15\) liters.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the original price of the book, we can use the relationship between the original price, the discount, and the final price Kyle paid. Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

Given that Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after a 25% discount, this means he paid 75% of the original price. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:

\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00."

3. **Cost of shoes:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
   - Each pair of shoes costs $42.
   - Total cost for shoes = 3 pairs * $42/pair = $126.

Now, we sum up the total costs for all the items:
- Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
- Total cost = $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

Therefore, Mishka spent a total of $243 on all the clothing items."
"Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. Over 60 days, she will consume 60 servings of ice cream.

Each carton contains 15 servings and costs $4.00. To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Since each carton costs $4.00, the total cost for 4 cartons is:

\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00/\text{carton} = \$16.00 \]

After 60 days, Cynthia will spend \(\boxed{16}\) dollars on ice cream."
"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between these two points on his trip.

1. Henry's first stop was after 20 miles.
2. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip. This means he stopped at the 45th mile (since 60 - 15 = 45).

Now, to find the distance between his first and second stops, we subtract the mile marker of the first stop from the mile marker of the second stop:

45 miles (second stop) - 20 miles (first stop) = 25 miles

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

25 miles"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. So, we can write the equation for the total cost of the two pairs of high heels as:
\[ 33 + 2 \times 33 = B - 5 \]

First, calculate the cost of the two pairs of high heels:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Therefore, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up the relationship between Darrell's and Allen's ages using the given ratio and total age.

Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total age of Darrell and Allen is given as 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can find Allen's current age:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine the guesses of each friend.

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add these guesses together and divide by the number of guesses (which is 3).

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

The average guess is 80."
"To find out how many hours John spends taking care of his dogs each week, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily care time for all dogs.
2. Multiply the daily care time by the number of days in a week.

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day, and John has 10 dogs. So, the daily care time for all dogs is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly care time is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of his dogs."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can set up the following equations based on the information given:
\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

70"
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Raymond has 40 jewels, and Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Then, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, we subtract 2 from this number to find out how many jewels Siobhan has:

\[ 25 - 2 = 23 \]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points.

25% of 4 points is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{25}{100} = 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Now, to find the total points scored by Mike, we add the points from both halves of the game:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total points Mike scored is:

"Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Over 30 days, he will consume:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

The yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00. To find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, so for 15 sets, the total cost is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his lego sets. He has 13 lego sets and sells each for $15. So, the total money from selling lego sets is:

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 8 video games he buys. Each video game costs $20, so the total cost is:

\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, John has $5 left. This means the money he spent on video games plus the $5 left equals the total money he had from selling the lego sets. We can confirm this by subtracting the money spent on video games from the total money he had:

\[ 195 - 160 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he has $5 left, this confirms the calculation is correct. The question asks how many lego sets he still has, but since he sold all 13 lego sets, the number of lego sets he still has is:

\[ 0 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 0 \]"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day. Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day. So, the distance he runs each of these days is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = \frac{3v}{2} \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   The total distance John runs in a week is the sum of the distances run on each of the three days:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying the right-hand side:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v + 3v}{2} = 3v + 3v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Given total distance:**
   We know that John runs 60 miles a week. Therefore:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]

5. **Solving for \( v \):**
   \[
   v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

**Final numerical answer:**
10 miles per hour"
"First, let's determine Dana's running and walking speeds based on her skipping speed.

Given:
- Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
- Her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed.

So, her running speed is:
\[ 3 \text{ mph} \times 2 = 6 \text{ mph} \]

Next, we know her running speed is four times her walking speed:
\[ 6 \text{ mph} = 4 \times \text{walking speed} \]
\[ \text{walking speed} = \frac{6 \text{ mph}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \]

Now, let's calculate the time she spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking in a six-hour period.

Time spent running:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Time spent walking:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the distance she covers while running and walking.

Distance running:
\[ 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Distance walking:
\[ 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances to find the total distance she can travel in six hours:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"If Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, then Ben's iPhone is 2 years old.

Since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, and Ben's iPhone is 2 years old, Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

Therefore, Brandon’s iPhone is 8 years old."
"When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the gold javelin three times farther than her normal throwing distance. Her normal throwing distance is 400 feet. Therefore, with the gemstone, she can throw the javelin:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside of the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside of the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

200 feet"
"Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pie pieces available initially is:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the initial number of pieces:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

26"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the calorie content per gram of chips:**
   - A 300g bag of chips has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories.
   - Therefore, the total calories in the 300g bag is \(5 \times 250 = 1250\) calories.
   - The calorie content per gram is \( \frac{1250 \text{ calories}}{300 \text{ grams}} = \frac{1250}{300} \approx 4.17 \text{ calories/gram} \).

2. **Calculate the remaining calories you can consume:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume is \(2000 - 1800 = 200\) calories.

3. **Determine how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining calories:**
   - Since each gram of chips contains approximately 4.17 calories, the number of grams you can eat is \( \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{4.17 \text{ calories/gram}} \approx 48 \text{ grams} \).

Therefore, you can eat approximately 48 grams of chips."
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed to make 20 candles.
2. Determine the total cost of the supplies.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed.
Since Charlie can make 10 candles per pound of beeswax, for 20 candles, he needs:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax} \]

Step 2: Determine the total cost of the supplies.
The cost for one pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00. Therefore, for 2 pounds, the cost is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
If each candle is sold for $2.00, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is:
\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00 \]

Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.
\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:
\[ \$20.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

- On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
- On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[ 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \]

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
\[ 26 \times 4 = 104 \]

Therefore, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is 104."
"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of Post-it notes Candice had: 80.
2. Let \( x \) be the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased.
3. At work, she used 220 Post-it notes.
4. After all these actions, she had 23 Post-it notes left.

We can set up the equation based on the information given:

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is 163.

163"
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\$200}{\$40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost of each red tie} = \$40 + 0.5 \times \$40 = \$40 + \$20 = \$60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times \$60 = \$600 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \$200 + \$600 = \$800 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{800} \]"
"To determine how many 6-inch pieces Tracy can obtain from a 4-foot piece of wire, we first need to convert the length of the wire into inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, a 4-foot piece of wire is:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we divide the total length of the wire in inches by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces she can get:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ inches}}{6 \text{ inches/piece}} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.
- The building has 15 floors.
- Each floor contains 8 units.
- Therefore, the total number of units is \(15 \times 8 = 120\).

Step 2: Determine the number of occupied units.
- 3/4 of the building is occupied.
- Therefore, the number of occupied units is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90\).

Step 3: Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.
- The number of unoccupied units is \(120 - 90 = 30\).

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To calculate how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many dozens of eggs are produced per day.
2. Calculate the daily earnings from selling the eggs.
3. Multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week to get the weekly earnings.

Step 1: Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.
Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Step 2: Calculate the daily earnings.
Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, so:
\[ 21 \text{ dozen} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$42 \text{ per day} \]

Step 3: Calculate the weekly earnings.
There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ \$42 \text{ per day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = \$294 \text{ per week} \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\$294\) on eggs per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to know the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. However, the distance is not provided in the question. Let's assume the distance from the starting point to the destination is \(D\) miles.

1. **Outbound Trip:**

"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, the remaining weight he needs to remove is:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys he needs to remove to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds is:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys."
"To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day and then find the difference.

**Thursday:**
- Truck tires: 6 tires × $60 per tire = $360
- Car tires: 4 tires × $40 per tire = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

**Friday:**
- Truck tires: 0 tires × $60 per tire = $0
- Car tires: 12 tires × $40 per tire = $480
- Total revenue on Friday = $0 + $480 = $480

**Difference in revenue:**
- Revenue on Thursday - Revenue on Friday = $520 - $480 = $40

The mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday compared to Friday."
"The Doubtfire sisters initially have 7 kittens. Their mother informs them that their two house cats, Patchy and Trixie, have had kittens as well. 

Trixie has had 12 kittens. Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which means Patchy has had \(3 \times 7 = 21\) kittens.

Now, we add the kittens from the house cats to the adopted kittens:
- Adopted kittens: 7
- Trixie's kittens: 12
- Patchy's kittens: 21

Total number of kittens = \(7 + 12 + 21 = 40\).

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the maximum weight the bridge can carry.
2. Subtract the weight of the empty truck and the driver from the bridge's weight limit to find out how much weight is available for the boxes.
3. Divide the available weight by the weight of each box to find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded.

Let's go through these steps:

1. The bridge's weight limit is 5000 pounds.
2. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Therefore, the available weight for the boxes is:
   \[
   5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded, we divide the available weight by the weight of each box:

"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to work backwards from the final bill, accounting for the additional fees and tip.

1. The final bill is $40.00, which includes a 25% fee and $3.00 in delivery fees, as well as a $4.00 tip.

2. First, we need to find the cost before the 25% fee and the $3.00 delivery fee were added. Let's denote the cost before these fees as \( x \).

3. The 25% fee on \( x \) is \( 0.25x \), and the total before the tip is \( x + 0.25x + 3.00 \).

4. The final bill is the total before the tip plus the $4.00 tip, so we have:
   \[
   x + 0.25x + 3.00 + 4.00 = 40.00
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   1.25x + 7.00 = 40.00
   \]
   Subtract 7.00 from both sides:
   \[
   1.25x = 33.00
   \]
   Divide both sides by 1.25:
   \[
   x = \frac{33.00}{1.25} = 26.40
   \]

5. The cost of the groceries before any additional fees or tip was $26.40.

6. Now, we can calculate the final price by adding the 25% fee, the $3.00 delivery fee, and the $4.00 tip to the original cost:
   \[
   26.40 + 0.25 \times 26.40 + 3.00 + 4.00 = 26.40 + 6.60 + 3.00 + 4.00 = 40.00

"After 20 years of service, Marcy becomes entitled to an additional 5% of the value of her pension per year. Her base annual pension is $50,000. 

For the first 20 years, she receives the base pension of $50,000 per year. After 20 years, she starts receiving an additional 5% of $50,000 per year.

The additional pension she receives after 20 years is:
\[ 50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500 \]

So, after 20 years, her total annual pension is:
\[ 50,000 + 2,500 = 52,500 \]

Since she quits after 30 years, she will receive this increased pension for the remaining 10 years of her service. Therefore, her annual pension after 30 years of service is:

3. **Total Amount Paid:**
   - Adding the amounts from both halves of the year: \( 840 + 756 = 1596 \) dollars.

The total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is **1596** dollars."
"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg). We know that Sophia has driven 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. Therefore, her car's fuel efficiency is:

\[ \text{Fuel Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Distance driven}}{\text{Gallons of gas used}} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Now, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank of 12 gallons. Using the fuel efficiency we calculated:

\[ \text{Miles per tank} = \text{Fuel Efficiency} \times \text{Tank capacity} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each time and reads for half as long, which is 1 hour. So, each session, he spends a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours on TV and reading.

He does this 3 times a week, so in one week, he spends 3 hours/session * 3 sessions/week = 9 hours.

Over 4 weeks, he would spend 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours.

Therefore, Jim spends 36 hours on TV and reading in 4 weeks."

1. Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players.
2. Each school also has 2 coaches (one for each team).

So, for each school:
- Number of players = 2 teams * 5 players/team = 10 players
- Number of coaches = 2 coaches

Therefore, the total number of people per school = 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people sent by all the schools is:
- Total number of people = 4 schools * 12 people/school = 48 people

"To find the total number of gems in the chest, we need to calculate the number of each type of gem and then sum them up.

1. **Diamonds**: There are 175 diamonds.
2. **Rubies**: There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So, the number of rubies is \(175 - 35 = 140\).
3. **Emeralds**: There are twice the number of emeralds than the rubies. So, the number of emeralds is \(2 \times 140 = 280\).

Now, we sum up all the gems:
\[ 175 \text{ (diamonds)} + 140 \text{ (rubies)} + 280 \text{ (emeralds)} = 595 \]

Therefore, the total number of gems in the chest is 595."
"First, let's determine the number of boys at Dr. Wertz's school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

Number of boys = 2 * Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 * 60
Number of boys = 120

Next, we need to find the total number of students at the school. This is the sum of the number of boys and the number of girls:

Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of students = 120 + 60
Total number of students = 180

Now, we know that there are 5 students for every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher:

Number of teachers = Total number of students / Number of students per teacher
Number of teachers = 180 / 5
Number of teachers = 36

Therefore, there are 36 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school."
"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to subtract the total amount she received from her allowance from her final total.

Bailey received $5 per week for 8 weeks, so the total amount from her allowance is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. To find out how much she started with, we subtract the total allowance from her final amount:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60."
"To calculate how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week.
2. Determine the total number of students she teaches in a week.
3. Calculate the total revenue based on the number of students and the charge per student.

First, let's calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week:

- She teaches 5 classes each weekday (Monday to Friday), so that's \(5 \times 5 = 25\) classes.
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.

So, the total number of classes in a week is \(25 + 8 = 33\).

Next, we calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week:

- Each class has 15 students, so for 33 classes, the total number of students is \(33 \times 15 = 495\).

Finally, we calculate the total revenue:

- She charges $15.00 per student, so for 495 students, the total revenue is \(495 \times 15 = 7425\).

Therefore, Judy makes \(\boxed{7425}\) dollars in one week."
"The first recipe has 20 instructions.

The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, which means it has \(20 \times 2 = 40\) instructions.

\(20 + 40 = 60\)

Kelian has to read 60 instructions to prepare the two dishes."
"To calculate the total amount of money Tommy raises, we need to multiply the number of each item sold by its price and then add the totals together.

For brownies:
- Tommy sells 43 brownies at $3 per slice.
- Total from brownies = 43 slices * $3/slice = $129

For cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake at $4 per slice.
- Total from cheesecakes = 23 slices * $4/slice = $92

Now, we add the totals from both items:
- Total money raised = $129 (from brownies) + $92 (from cheesecakes) = $221

Therefore, Tommy raises a total of $221."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones without interest:

\[ 5 \text{ phones} \times \$150 \text{ per phone} = \$750 \]

Next, we calculate the total interest for the 3-month installment. The interest rate is 2% per unit, and since there are five units, the total interest is:

\[ 5 \times 2\% \times \$150 = 5 \times 0.02 \times \$150 = \$15 \]

So, the total amount Shiela will pay is the sum of the original cost and the interest:

\[ \$750 + \$15 = \$765 \]

Since this total amount is to be paid in 3 monthly installments, we divide the total amount by 3:

\[ \frac{\$765}{3} = \$255 \]

Therefore, Shiela will pay each month for 3 months:

\[ \$255 \]"
"First, let's round the prices to the nearest dollar:

- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3
- Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2

- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3 = $36
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2 = $18
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2 = $34

Finally, we add up the totals:

$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

Artie will make $88."
"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given that the top level has a square footage of 16, and each subsequent level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of each level as follows:

1. Top level (Level 1): 16 square feet
2. Level 2: \(16 \div 2 = 8\) square feet
3. Level 3: \(8 \div 2 = 4\) square feet
4. Level 4: \(4 \div 2 = 2\) square feet

Now, we sum the square footage of all levels:

\[16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30\]

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:

\[\text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5\]

Therefore, the average square footage of a level is 7.5 square feet."
"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will consume in the first 365 days.

For the first 180 days, the puppy will consume 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food for the first 180 days is:
\[ 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

For the remaining days in the first year, which is \(365 - 180 = 185\) days, the puppy will consume 2 cups of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food for the remaining 185 days is:
\[ 185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total amount of dog food consumed in the first year:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags needed is:
\[ \frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \text{ bags} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the amount of laundry David does:**
   - Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.

   - Therefore, David does \( \frac{400}{4} = 100 \) pounds of laundry.

2. **Determine the amount of laundry Raymond does:**
   - Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.
   - Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
   - Therefore, Raymond does \( \frac{400}{2} = 200 \) pounds of laundry.

3. **Calculate the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David:**
   - Raymond does 200 pounds of laundry.
   - David does 100 pounds of laundry.
   - The difference is \( 200 - 100 = 100 \) pounds.

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds."
"To determine how much money Vincent saves, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in the most economical way versus the less economical way.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:
- Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
- Total cost: \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15.00 \)

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1.00 each:
- Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
- Total cost: \( 9 \times 1.00 = 9.00 \)

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two options:
- Cost difference: \( 15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00 \)

Therefore, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

The final numerical answer is:

"The original cost of the grooming is $100. With a 30% discount, the cost is reduced by 30% of $100.

30% of $100 = 0.30 * $100 = $30

So, the discount amount is $30.

Subtract the discount from the original cost:
$100 - $30 = $70

The final cost of the grooming is $70."
"Each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water. So, the amount of water each girl got is:

\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they got together is:

\[ 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

The boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water distributed is:

\[ 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

The initial amount of water was 24 liters. Therefore, the amount of water left is:

\[ 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

10 liters of water were left."

"First, let's calculate Alex's weight. Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. So, we calculate 4 times Grace's weight and then subtract 2 pounds.

\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \]
\[ 500 - 2 = 498 \]

So, Alex weighs 498 pounds.

Now, to find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight to Alex's weight.

\[ 125 + 498 = 623 \]

Their combined weights are 623 pounds."

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( W + L = 22 \)
2. \( W = L + 8 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find the number of games they won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

The alarm rang a total of 22 times."
"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the salary increase after 5 years.
2. Calculate the salary increase for each of the next three years.

**Step 1: Calculate the salary after 5 years.**

Sylvie's initial salary is $600. After 5 years, her salary is increased by 10% of $600.

\[ \text{Salary after 5 years} = 600 + (0.10 \times 600) = 600 + 60 = 660 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the salary for each of the next three years.**

Each year, her salary is increased by 10% of the previous year's salary.

- **Year 6:**
\[ \text{Salary} = 660 + (0.10 \times 660) = 660 + 66 = 726 \]

- **Year 7:**
\[ \text{Salary} = 726 + (0.10 \times 726) = 726 + 72.6 = 798.6 \]

- **Year 8:**
\[ \text{Salary} = 798.6 + (0.10 \times 798.6) = 798.6 + 79.86 = 878.46 \]

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is $878.46."
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies."
"Christina invited 16 friends, but since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we need to calculate the number of guests who are expected to attend.

1/4 of 16 friends don't show up, so:

"First, we need to determine Gerald's original time for the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, and Lee's current time is 38 seconds, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's current time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to calculate Gerald's new time after his speed improved by 10%. An improvement in speed by 10% means that Gerald can now run 110% of the distance in the same time. Therefore, his new time is:

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = \text{Gerald's original time} \times \frac{100\%}{110\%} = 40 \text{ seconds} \times \frac{100}{110} = 40 \text{ seconds} \times \frac{10}{11} = \frac{400}{11} \text{ seconds} \approx 36.36 \text{ seconds} \]

So, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in:

"Given that the number of dogs is 60, and there are two cats for every dog, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we first find the combined number of dogs and cats:

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120
Combined number of dogs and cats = 180

The number of rabbits is twelve less than this combined number:

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the volume of tomatoes before they are cooked into sauce.
2. Calculate the number of cans of tomatoes used.
3. Calculate the number of tomatoes used based on the number of cans.

First, we know that the sauce made is 32 ounces, and this is after the tomatoes have lost half their volume during cooking. This means that the volume of tomatoes before cooking was twice the volume of the sauce. So, the volume of tomatoes before cooking is:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes were used to get 64 ounces of tomatoes. The number of cans is:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is:
\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We start with 30 cars on the motorway.
2. After 15 minutes, some cars drive through the traffic jam.
3. In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through the traffic jam.
4. Additionally, 5 cars take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the 30 minutes is \( x + 20 \).

Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that actually drove through the traffic jam is the original number of cars minus the 5 that took an exit. This gives us the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 30 - 5 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

Final answer:

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box, then find its inner volume, and finally multiply by 3.

1. **Determine the inner dimensions:**
   - The original dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).
   - Inner length = 5 - 2 = 3 inches
   - Inner width = 6 - 2 = 4 inches
   - Inner height = 4 - 2 = 2 inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - Inner volume of one box = length × width × height
   - Inner volume of one box = 3 inches × 4 inches × 2 inches = 24 cubic inches

3. **Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:**
   - Total inner volume = inner volume of one box × 3
   - Total inner volume = 24 cubic inches × 3 = 72 cubic inches

**Final numerical answer:**
72 cubic inches"
"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the total hours of TV he watched throughout the week and then isolate the Wednesday viewing.

1. **Monday and Tuesday**: Frankie watched 1-hour episodes each night.
   - Total for Monday and Tuesday: \(1 \, \text{hour} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 2 \, \text{hours}\)

2. **Thursday**: Frankie watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show.
   - Total for Thursday: \(1 \, \text{hour} + 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 1.5 \, \text{hours}\)

3. **Friday**: Frankie watched two 1-hour episodes.
   - Total for Friday: \(2 \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 2 \, \text{hours}\)

4. **Total hours for Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday**: 
   - \(2 \, \text{hours} + 1.5 \, \text{hours} + 2 \, \text{hours} = 5.5 \, \text{hours}\)

5. **Total hours of TV watched in the week**: 7 hours.

6. **Hours watched on Wednesday**:
   - \(7 \, \text{hours} - 5.5 \, \text{hours} = 1.5 \, \text{hours}\)

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, we can determine the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday by dividing the total hours watched on Wednesday by the length of each episode:
- Number of 30-minute episodes on Wednesday: \(1.5 \, \text{hours} \div 0.5 \, \text{hours/episode} = 3 \, \text{episodes}\)

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday."
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies. However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he had left is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To find out how much the gas will cost after the cashback rewards, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without the cashback.
2. Calculate the total cashback for 10 gallons.
3. Subtract the total cashback from the total cost to find the final cost.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without the cashback.
- Cost per gallon = $3.00
- Number of gallons = 10
- Total cost = $3.00 * 10 = $30.00

Step 2: Calculate the total cashback for 10 gallons.
- Cashback per gallon = $0.20
- Number of gallons = 10
- Total cashback = $0.20 * 10 = $2.00

Step 3: Subtract the total cashback from the total cost to find the final cost.
- Final cost = Total cost - Total cashback
- Final cost = $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The final cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."
"To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate in total, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each of them had.

For Beatrice:
- The roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice had is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

For Marcell:
- The roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell had is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Now, we add the total number of fruit roll-ups that both Marcell and Beatrice had:
- Total = \(48 + 42 = 90\).

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by the number of people (which is 2):
- Average = \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\).

Therefore, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is 45."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many feet Julia rows to reach the shore and then calculate the amount of water that enters the boat based on the given rate.

First, we need to find out how many feet Julia rows in 64 seconds. We know that it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, we can calculate the rate at which she rows in feet per second:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5}{4} \text{ feet per second} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance she rows in 64 seconds:

\[ \text{Distance} = \left(\frac{5}{4} \text{ feet per second}\right) \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. To find out how much water is taken on for 80 feet, we use the following calculation:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \left(\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
2. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. So, Brittany's phone can hold \( \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \) photographs.
3. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as \( D \). Therefore, we have the equation: \( 300 = 50D \).
4. Solving for \( D \), we get \( D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \).

So, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is 6.

"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue from selling it, then find the difference between the two.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought:

1. **Cost of 2x4x10 boards:**
   - Each board cost $10.
   - She has 10 boards.
   - Total cost for 2x4x10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

2. **Cost of 4x4x10 boards:**
   - Each board cost $16.
   - She has 5 boards.
   - Total cost for 4x4x10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

3. **Total cost of all boards:**
   - Total cost = Cost of 2x4x10 boards + Cost of 4x4x10 boards
   - Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:

1. **Revenue from 2x4x10 boards:**
   - Assume she sells each board at the same price she bought it for, which is $10.
   - Total revenue for 2x4x10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

2. **Revenue from 4x4x10 boards:**
   - Assume she sells each board at the same price she bought it for, which is $16.
   - Total revenue for 4x4x10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

3. **Total revenue from all boards:**
   - Total revenue = Revenue from 2x4x10 boards + Revenue from 4x4x10 boards
   - Total revenue = $100 + $80 = $180.

Finally, let's calculate the profit:

- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
- Profit = $180 - $180 = $0.

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of $0."
"Given the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, we can represent the amount of sugar and water used as 7x and 13x respectively, where x is a common multiplier.

The total amount of sugar and water used is given as 120 teaspoons. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 13x = 120\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[20x = 120\]

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now, to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used, we multiply the value of x by 7 (since the ratio of sugar is 7 parts):

\[7x = 7 \times 6 = 42\]

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is 42."
"John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children. Since each pair of shoes costs $60, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

1. First, find the total number of pairs of shoes: \(2 \text{ pairs/child} \times 3 \text{ children} = 6 \text{ pairs}\).
2. Then, calculate the total cost: \(6 \text{ pairs} \times \$60/\text{pair} = \$360\).

"On the first day, the customs officer counted 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles on the first day is:

2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

On the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day:

30 vehicles (total on the second day) - 10 vehicles (from the first day) = 20 vehicles

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:

20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.
   - Let Lylah's salary four years ago be \( L \).
   - Therefore, \( 40,000 = L + 0.30L \).
   - This simplifies to \( 40,000 = 1.30L \).
   - Solving for \( L \), we get \( L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} \approx 30,769.23 \).

2. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Four years later, his salary increased by 40%.
   - Therefore, Adrien's new salary is \( 40,000 + 0.40 \times 40,000 = 40,000 \times 1.40 = 56,000 \).

3. **Calculate Lylah's salary four years later:**
   - Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.
   - Assuming Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's (40%), her new salary is \( 30,769.23 + 0.40 \times 30,769.23 = 30,769.23 \times 1.40 \approx 43,076.92 \).

4. **Calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later:**
   - Adrien's new salary is $56,000.
   - Lylah's new salary is approximately $43,076.92.
   - Therefore, the total salary is \( 56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92 \).

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is $99,076.92."

"Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps. 

First, calculate one-third of 60:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]

So, Jennie stamps 20 letters. These 20 letters are added to the pile of already-stamped letters. We know that after stamping, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. 

To find out how many letters were in the pile when Jennie began, we subtract the 20 newly-stamped letters from the total of 30 already-stamped letters:
\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \]

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

Final numerical answer:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons.
2. Her husband gave her a package of 5 spoons.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.
4. After using the spoons, she had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as \( x \).

So, the total number of spoons Julia had before using any was:
\[ x + 5 \]

After using 3 spoons, she had:
\[ (x + 5) - 3 = 12 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]
\[ x + 2 = 12 \]
\[ x = 12 - 2 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

"Given that each pepper costs $15, we can calculate the cost of the other items based on this information.

1. **Cost of a watermelon:**
   - A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.
   - Therefore, the cost of a watermelon = 3 * $15 = $45.

2. **Cost of an orange:**
   - An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs.
   - Therefore, the cost of an orange = $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the items Dillon is buying:

- **Cost of 4 watermelons:**
  - 4 * $45 = $180.

- **Cost of 20 peppers:**
  - 20 * $15 = $300.

- **Cost of 10 oranges:**
  - 10 * $40 = $400.

Finally, we add up the costs to find the total amount Dillon will spend:

"To determine how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the number of questions he was able to complete in each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions in each test.

For the first test:
- Total questions: 75
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 8 hours

First, we calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the first test:
\[ \text{Questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time available} = 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 40 \, \text{questions} \]

Since the test had 75 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is:
\[ \text{Incomplete questions} = \text{Total questions} - \text{Questions completed} = 75 - 40 = 35 \]

For the second test:
- Total questions: 100
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 6 hours

Next, we calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the second test:
\[ \text{Questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time available} = 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{questions} \]

Since the test had 100 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is:
\[ \text{Incomplete questions} = \text{Total questions} - \text{Questions completed} = 100 - 30 = 70 \]

Adding the incomplete questions from both tests:
\[ \text{Total incomplete questions} = 35 + 70 = 105 \]

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many cars are semi-automatic. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. 

So, the number of semi-automatic cars is:
\[ 20 - (12 + 4) = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

Therefore, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic."
"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \). According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so the number of baby bees is \( 2Q \). Additionally, there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees is \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is the sum of the number of queens, baby bees, and worker bees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Since the number of worker bees is \( 4Q \), we substitute \( Q = 100 \) into the equation:
\[ 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\)."
"First, let's calculate how many hours Jordan spends playing video games in one week. Since he plays for 2 hours every day, and there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total hours spent playing video games as follows:

\[ 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{hours/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jordan would earn if he spent those 14 hours working instead of playing video games. Since he earns $10 per hour at his part-time job, we can calculate his earnings as follows:

\[ 14 \, \text{hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$140/\text{week} \]

Therefore, if Jordan spent his video game time working instead, he would earn \(\boxed{140}\) dollars in one week."
"First, let's identify the food and non-food items from the list:

- Milk: Food item (2 dollars)
- Eggs: Food item (3 dollars)
- Light bulbs: Non-food item (3 dollars)
- Cups: Non-food item (3 dollars)
- Roach traps: Non-food item (4 dollars)

Next, we calculate the total cost of the non-food items:
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars

Total cost of non-food items = 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Now, we apply the 10% tax to the non-food items:
Tax on non-food items = 10% of 10 dollars = 0.10 * 10 = 1 dollar

So, the total cost of the non-food items including tax is:
10 dollars (original cost) + 1 dollar (tax) = 11 dollars

Now, we add the cost of the food items:
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars

Total cost of food items = 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Finally, we add the total cost of the food items to the total cost of the non-food items including tax:
Total cost = 5 dollars (food) + 11 dollars (non-food with tax) = 16 dollars

Therefore, the total cost of everything is 16 dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have:

- Kim already has 3 clients.
- He is talking to 5 potential clients.
- Therefore, the total number of clients will be \(3 + 5 = 8\).

Next, we calculate the total expenses for the supplies:

- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
- The cost of 1 bottle of bleach is $2.
- The cost of 1 pack of cloths is $5.
- Therefore, the cost for supplies per client is \(2 \times 2 + 1 \times 5 = 4 + 5 = 9\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total expenses for all clients:

- The total number of clients is 8.
- The cost per client is $9.
- Therefore, the total expenses are \(8 \times 9 = 72\) dollars.

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:

- Total income = $92
- Total expenses = $72
- Profit = $92 - $72 = $20

Therefore, the profit Kim will make each week is $20."
"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare that John can harvest in one harvest.
2. Determine how many harvests John can make in a year.
3. Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the number of harvests in a year to get the total number of pineapples harvested in a year.

Step 1: Pineapples per hectare per harvest
- There are 100 pineapples per hectare.

Step 2: Number of harvests in a year
- John can harvest every 3 months, which means there are 4 harvests in a year (12 months / 3 months per harvest).

Step 3: Total pineapples harvested in a year
- Total pineapples = (Pineapples per hectare per harvest) × (Number of hectares) × (Number of harvests in a year)
- Total pineapples = 100 pineapples/hectare × 10 hectares × 4 harvests/year
- Total pineapples = 100 × 10 × 4
- Total pineapples = 4000

Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year."
"Johnny has three Lego sets to pick up. 

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, which is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, which is \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

To find the total number of pieces Johnny picks up, we add the pieces from all three sets:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

Johnny picks up 2125 blocks."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return, which is 15 bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the first 6 hours leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
4. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first 6 hours and did not return in the second 6 hours return. Since 15 bees returned in the second 6 hours, 30 - 15 = 15 bees did not return in the second 6 hours. So, 15 bees from the first 6 hours plus the 60 bees that left in the third 6 hours return in the last 6 hours.

Therefore, the total number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is 15 (from the first 6 hours) + 60 (from the third 6 hours) = 75 bees.

"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we first need to calculate the total cost of the tickets.

The cost for 1 child ticket is $10, and the cost for 1 adult ticket is $12. Therefore, the total cost for both tickets is:

\[ 10 + 12 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means that the amount she gave the cashier minus the total cost of the tickets equals $8. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ \text{Amount given} - 22 = 8 \]

To find the amount given, we add 22 to both sides of the equation:

\[ \text{Amount given} = 8 + 22 \]
\[ \text{Amount given} = 30 \]

So, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has first, and then use that information to find out how many friends James has.

1. Let's denote the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has as \( D \).
2. According to the problem, Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. Since Charlie has 12 friends, we can write the equation:
   \[
   3D = 12
   \]
3. Solving for \( D \):
   \[
   D = \frac{12}{3} = 4
   \]
   So, Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends.
4. James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy. Therefore, the number of friends James has is:
   \[
   4D = 4 \times 4 = 16
   \]

Therefore, James has 16 Facebook friends."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: 3 miles = 3 * 5280 feet = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles = 2 * 5280 feet = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Steve's time: \( \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet per minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \)
- Tim's time: \( \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet per minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \)

The difference in their times is:
- \( 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \)

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at his house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

The final numerical answer is:
4 minutes"
"To calculate how much Shawnda made, we need to determine the total number of tires inflated and then convert that into dollars based on the cost per tire.

1. **Bicycles**: Each bicycle has 2 tires. On the first day, 5 people came by to get both tires inflated.
   - Total tires from bicycles: \(5 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ tires/person} = 10 \text{ tires}\)

2. **Tricycles**: Each tricycle has 3 tires. On the first day, 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated.
   - Total tires from tricycles: \(3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ tires/person} = 9 \text{ tires}\)

3. **Unicycle**: A unicycle has 1 tire. On the first day, 1 person came by to get their unicycle tire inflated.
   - Total tires from unicycle: \(1 \text{ person} \times 1 \text{ tire/person} = 1 \text{ tire}\)

Now, we add up all the tires:
- Total tires inflated: \(10 \text{ tires (bicycles)} + 9 \text{ tires (tricycles)} + 1 \text{ tire (unicycle)} = 20 \text{ tires}\)

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. To find the total cost in dollars, we convert the cents to dollars:
- Total cost in cents: \(20 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 500 \text{ cents}\)
- Total cost in dollars: \(500 \text{ cents} \div 100 \text{ cents/dollar} = 5 \text{ dollars}\)

Therefore, Shawnda made \(\boxed{5}\) dollars that day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys:
- Carl buys 10 packs of cookies.
- Each pack contains 6 cookies.
- Therefore, the total number of cookies is \(10 \times 6 = 60\).

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cookies:
- Each cookie costs $0.10.
- Therefore, the total cost for 60 cookies is \(60 \times 0.10 = 6\) dollars.

Now, let's determine how much change Carl receives if he pays with a $10 bill:
- Carl pays with $10.
- The total cost of the cookies is $6.
- Therefore, the change Carl receives is \(10 - 6 = 4\) dollars.

Final numerical answer:

"Let's work through the problem step by step, starting from the end and moving backwards.

1. **Final state**: 5 fries are left.
2. **Before the ants carried off the last fry**: There were 6 fries (since the ants carried off 1 fry).
3. **Before the raccoon stole two-thirds of the fries**: Let's denote the number of fries before the raccoon stole as \( x \). The raccoon stole two-thirds, so one-third remained. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{3}x = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 6 \times 3 = 18 \).
4. **Before the three pigeons ate their share**: Each pigeon ate 3 fries, so the pigeons ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries. Therefore, before the pigeons ate, there were \( 18 + 9 = 27 \) fries.
5. **Before the seagull ate half of what Dave ate**: Let's denote the number of fries the seagull ate as \( y \). The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, so Dave ate \( 2y \). The seagull ate \( y \) fries, and Dave ate \( 2y \) fries, so the total before the seagull ate was \( 27 + y + 2y = 27 + 3y \). After the seagull ate, there were \( 27 - y \) fries left. We know that \( 27 - y = 18 \), so \( y = 27 - 18 = 9 \). Therefore, Dave ate \( 2y = 2 \times 9 = 18 \) fries.
6. **Before Dave ate his fries**: Dave ate 18 fries, and there were 27 fries before the seagull ate. So, the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \( 27 + 14 = 41 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the hours for the days he has three 1-hour classes:
- He has three 1-hour classes each on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.
- So, for these three days, he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours per day.
- Over three days, that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the hours for the days he has two 2-hour classes:
- He has two 2-hour classes each on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
- So, for these two days, he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours per day.
- Over two days, that's \(2 \times 4 = 8\) hours.

Now, let's add the hours from both types of days to get the total weekly hours:
- Total weekly hours = \(9 + 8 = 17\) hours.

Finally, to find the total hours for the entire semester, we multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks in the semester:
- Total semester hours = \(17 \times 16 = 272\) hours.

So, Kimo spends a total of 272 hours attending classes in one semester."
"First, let's convert all measurements to feet since the final answer needs to be in feet.

- Each roll is 4 inches long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each roll is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet long.
- Each chocolate croissant is 6 inches long, which is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet long.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Now, let's calculate the total length for each type of baked good:

- For the rolls: \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.
- For the chocolate croissants: \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.
- For the baguettes: \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

Adding these together gives the total length:

\( 100 + 60 + 120 = 280 \) feet.

Therefore, if Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they will be 280 feet long."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we first calculate the monthly requirement for each type of ape and then double it for the 2-month period.

1. **Monkeys' Requirement:**
   - Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(200 \times 2 = 400\) bananas.

2. **Gorillas' Requirement:**
   - Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(400 \times 2 = 800\) bananas.

3. **Baboons' Requirement:**
   - Baboons need 100 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(100 \times 2 = 200\) bananas.

Now, we add up the total number of bananas needed for all the apes over 2 months:
\[400 \text{ (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas}\]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Since the football field is 100 yards long, running back and forth once is 200 yards. Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so the total distance Blake runs is:

\[ 200 \, \text{yards} \times 15 = 3000 \, \text{yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards, and she does this 34 times. So, the total distance Kelly runs is:

\[ 80 \, \text{yards} \times 34 = 2720 \, \text{yards} \]

Now, we need to find out how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Since Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards, the difference in the distance they run is:

\[ 3000 \, \text{yards} - 2720 \, \text{yards} = 280 \, \text{yards} \]

Therefore, the winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser."
"To find out how much Raphael spent on everything, we need to calculate the total cost of each item he bought and then sum these amounts.

1. The cost of the pens: \(4 \text{ pens} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pen} = \$6\)
2. The cost of the notebooks: \(2 \text{ notebooks} \times \$4 \text{ per notebook} = \$8\)
3. The cost of the bond paper: \(1 \text{ rim of bond paper} \times \$20 = \$20\)

"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 of them come out from under a lily pad, which doesn't change the total number of tadpoles he sees, as they were already part of the 11. After that, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so those 2 are no longer visible to Finn.

So, the number of tadpoles Finn can see now is:

11 - 2 = 9

Finn can see 9 tadpoles in the pond now."
"On Monday, the tank has a depth of 17 feet.

On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth is:
\[ 17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet} \]

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

The tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin:

- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3

Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Next, let's calculate the number of fish caught by Locsin:

- Starfish: 5 fewer than Anakin = 10 - 5 = 5
- Sea horses: 3 fewer than Anakin = 6 - 3 = 3
- Clownfish: 2 more than Anakin = 3 + 2 = 5

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, let's add the total fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:

Total fish caught by Anakin and Locsin = 19 + 13 = 32

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

First, let's determine how many times the price will increase in 36 months. Since the price increases every two months, we divide 36 by 2:

\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

This means the price will increase 18 times over 36 months.

The original price of the bag of marbles is $20. Each time the price increases, it increases by 20% of the original price. A 20% increase can be represented as multiplying by 1.20 (since 100% + 20% = 120%, or 1.20 in decimal form).

The formula to calculate the price after \( n \) increases is:

\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} \times (1.20)^n \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):

\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366 \]

So, the final price is:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32 \]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $787.32."
"Given:
- 5 red cars, each costing $4.
- 3 action figures, each costing $5.
- The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the red cars:
\[ 5 \text{ red cars} \times \$4 \text{ per red car} = \$20 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the action figures:
\[ 3 \text{ action figures} \times \$5 \text{ per action figure} = \$15 \]

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5:
\[ \text{Cost of the doll} = 3 \times \$5 = \$15 \]

Now, add up the total cost of all the toys:
\[ \$20 \text{ (red cars)} + \$15 \text{ (action figures)} + \$15 \text{ (doll)} = \$50 \]

Therefore, the total worth of all the toys is:
\[ \$50 \]"
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the total cost of hiring the accountant and compare it to the lost income from doing her taxes herself.

1. Calculate the lost income from doing her taxes herself:
   - She loses $35 for each hour of freelance work.
   - She loses 3 hours of work.
   - Total lost income = $35/hour * 3 hours = $105.

2. The cost of hiring the accountant is $90.

3. Calculate the difference between the lost income and the cost of hiring the accountant:
   - Difference = Lost income - Cost of accountant
   - Difference = $105 - $90 = $15.

So, if Jackie hires the accountant, she will have $15 more. 

**Final Answer:**

"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she has chosen and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's add up the costs of the items:
- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Keyboard: (assumed to be included in the computer price, so no additional cost)
- Mouse: (assumed to be included in the computer price, so no additional cost)
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €157 + €74 + €102

Now, let's do the addition:
1090 + 157 = 1247
1247 + 157 = 1404
1404 + 74 = 1478
1478 + 102 = 1580

The total cost of the items is €1580.

Elvira's budget is €1500. Since the total cost of the items exceeds her budget, she will not have any money left for clothing. In fact, she will be short by €80.

Therefore, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is:
€0

This is because the total cost of the items she chose is €80 more than her budget."
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she will need for 15 Spanish flans. Since each flan requires 3 eggs, we can calculate the total number of eggs required as follows:

\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get 45 eggs. Since her neighbor gives her 9 eggs each time she babysits, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:

\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28, so \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

We can simplify the second equation:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:
\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

16"
"Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. If Ethel has $8, we can calculate how much money Jimmy has as follows:

Twice the money Ethel has is \(2 \times 8 = 16\).

Adding $2 to that amount gives \(16 + 2 = 18\).

So, Jimmy has $18."
"Pancho walks 20 miles each day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, the total miles he walks from Monday to Friday is:

\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles each day. So, the total miles he walks on the weekend is:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the miles walked during the weekdays and the weekend gives:

\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week is:

120 miles"
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the hat is given as $25.
2. The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so:
   \[
   \text{Cost of jacket} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket, so:
   \[
   \text{Cost of pants} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to get the total cost of each uniform:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is $150."

2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we add up the ages of all four birds:
- Sally Two: 19 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years

Total age = \(19 + 8 + 16 + 8 = 41\)

The total age of the four birds is 41."
"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum on all her debts, we first need to calculate the total minimum monthly payment and then find 150% of that amount.

1. Calculate the total minimum monthly payment:
   - Student loans: $300
   - Credit card: $200
   - Mortgage: $500
   - Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

2. Calculate 50% more than the minimum monthly payment:
   - 50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500
   - Total payment = $1000 + $500 = $1500

3. Calculate the total annual payment:
   - Annual payment = $1500 * 12 = $18000

Therefore, Jessica pays $18000 in a year."
"To calculate the total time Billy will take to prep the potatoes, we need to consider the time taken for peeling and cutting each potato, and then multiply by the total number of potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time taken to peel one potato:
- It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.

Next, let's calculate the time taken to cut one potato:
- It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut one potato.

Now, let's convert the peeling time into seconds for easier calculation:
- 1.5 minutes = 1.5 * 60 seconds = 90 seconds

Now, we can calculate the total time for peeling all 60 potatoes:
- 90 seconds per potato * 60 potatoes = 5400 seconds

Next, we calculate the total time for cutting all 60 potatoes:
- 5 seconds per potato * 60 potatoes = 300 seconds

Finally, we add the total peeling time and the total cutting time to get the overall prep time:
- 5400 seconds (peeling) + 300 seconds (cutting) = 5700 seconds

To convert the total time back into minutes:
- 5700 seconds / 60 seconds per minute = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

95 minutes"

Therefore, they spent $15 on lemons."
"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Chinese participants.
2. Subtract the number of boys on the Chinese team from the total number of Chinese participants to find the number of girls.

First, we know the total number of Asians is 240, and out of these, 80 are Japanese. Therefore, the number of Chinese participants is:
\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

Next, we know that out of these 160 Chinese participants, 60 are boys. Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team is:
\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is \(\boxed{100}\)."
"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent and car fuel.

1. Rent: \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his salary
\[ \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \]

2. Car fuel: \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his salary
\[ \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \]

Now, let's find out how much money is left after these expenses.
\[ \text{Remaining after rent and car fuel} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \]

Next, Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
\[ \text{Donation to charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \]

Now, let's find out how much money is left after the donation.
\[ \text{Remaining after donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \]

Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$.
\[ \text{Total given to daughter and wife} = 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Finally, let's calculate how much money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations.
\[ \text{Final amount} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{350} \]"

\[ \text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of votes the loser got is 20."
"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we need to first find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, and Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies. Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( W \).

From the information given:
\[ 5W = 200 \]

Solving for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now, we know Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can denote the number of red roses as \( R \).

From the information given:
\[ R = 4W \]

Substituting the value of \( W \):
\[ R = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Jan is 30 years old.
2. Two years ago, Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.
3. Let's denote Mark's current age as \( M \).
4. Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
5. According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   M - 2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 28 + 5
   \]
6. Simplify the right side of the equation:
   \[
   M - 2 = 14 + 5 = 19
   \]
7. Solving for \( M \):
   \[
   M = 19 + 2 = 21

"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay race.

**Faster Team:**
Each of the four runners completes the 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time for the faster team = 4 runners × 55 seconds/runner = 220 seconds.

**Less Well-Rounded Team:**
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 seconds - 3 seconds = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 seconds - 3 seconds = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 seconds - 3 seconds = 51 seconds

Total time for the less well-rounded team = 60 seconds + 57 seconds + 54 seconds + 51 seconds = 222 seconds.

**Difference in Time:**
The faster team's total time is 220 seconds, and the less well-rounded team's total time is 222 seconds.
The difference in time = 222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the ratio of the probabilities and then converting it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[ \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \]

This means the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200\% \]

So, it is 200% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

**Final Answer:**

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and use the information given to find the number of rats in each cage.

1. **Hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = 10 cages * 5 pieces/cage = 50 pieces.

2. **Rabbits:**
   - 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

3. **Total straw used:**
   - 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents (rats and hamsters).

4. **Straw used for rats:**
   - Total straw - Straw for hamsters - Straw for rabbits = Straw for rats.
   - 160 - 50 - 20 = 90 pieces of straw for rats.

5. **Rats:**
   - The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups.
   - Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for rats = 90 pieces.
   - Number of rats = Total straw for rats / Straw per rat = 90 / 6 = 15 rats.
   - Since these 15 rats are in 3 cages, the number of rats per cage = 15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats/cage.

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is 5."
"To calculate the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to account for the monthly interest compounded each month.

1. **Initial Amount**: $100
2. **Monthly Interest Rate**: 2% or 0.02

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The tickets cost $20.25 in total. The food cost $4.50 less than the tickets, so the food cost is:

\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the rides. Each ride costs $33, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is:

\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:

\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year, so the net increase is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees per year.
3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the net increase in trees is \(8 \times 10 = 80\) trees. Adding this to the initial number of trees, we get \(50 + 80 = 130\) trees.
4. **Trees that die**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, the number of trees that die is \(0.30 \times 130 = 39\) trees.
5. **Final number of trees**: Subtracting the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years, we get \(130 - 39 = 91\) trees.

Therefore, the final number of trees Tom has left is **91**."

To find out the score she needs on the sixth test, we need to consider that the lowest score among the six will be dropped. The current lowest score is 71. If 71 is dropped, the sum of the remaining five scores should be 465. Therefore, we need to find the score \( x \) such that:
\[ 438 + x - 71 = 465 \]
\[ 438 + x - 71 = 465 \]
\[ 367 + x = 465 \]
\[ x = 465 - 367 \]
\[ x = 98 \]

So, Brinley needs to score 98 on her sixth test to get an average of 93 after dropping the lowest score.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"To find out the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the distance for each period and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the distance for the first four weeks:
- He rode 5 times a week.
- Each ride was 25 kilometers.
- He did this for 4 weeks.

So, the total distance for the first four weeks is:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance for the following three weeks:
- He rode 2 times a week.
- Each ride was 60 kilometers.
- He did this for 3 weeks.

So, the total distance for the next three weeks is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ km/ride} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km} \]

Now, we add the distances from both periods to get the total distance:
\[ 500 \text{ km} + 360 \text{ km} = 860 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the total kilometers Micheal did in total is:
\[ 860 \text{ km} \]"
"Each chocolate bar weighs 40g, and since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 20g.

Joe has 25 chocolate bars, so the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
\[ 25 \times 40g = 1000g \]

Joe also has 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
\[ 80 \times 20g = 1600g \]

Adding the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples together gives the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:
\[ 1000g + 1600g = 2600g \]

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600 grams."
"On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

To find the total number of cakes she bought over the three days, we add the number of cakes from each day:

\(4 + 12 + 60 = 76\)

So, Rose bought a total of 76 cakes after all three days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates would be 6 plates.
   - Therefore, the cost of half a dozen plates is \(6 \times 6000 = 36000\) dollars.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is \(36000 - 1200 = 34800\) dollars.

3. **Determine the cost of one dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups cost $34800.
   - Therefore, the cost of one dozen cups is \(\frac{34800}{20} = 1740\) dollars.

4. **Determine the cost of one cup:**
   - One dozen cups is 12 cups.
   - Therefore, the cost of one cup is \(\frac{1740}{12} = 145\) dollars.

The total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{145}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so her total earnings from babysitting are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from mowing the lawn:
- Let \(x\) be the number of times she mows the lawn.
- She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, so her total earnings from mowing the lawn are \(4x\) dollars.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the total amount of money she has before mowing the lawn is \(10 + 20 = 30\) dollars.

To find out how much more money she needs to afford the jacket and shoes, we subtract the amount she already has from the total cost:
- The amount she still needs is \(70 - 30 = 40\) dollars.

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can set up the equation:
\[4x = 40\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[x = \frac{40}{4} = 10\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, as he is walking around the edge. The park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles by 6 miles.

The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking."
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total.

So, the number of customers on the third day is \(500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\).

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. We know that both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 \) gallons. This can be written as:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we have:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool now has \( 8 \) gallons of water.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the shoes and the belt is $352.00.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Her part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find the number of hours, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months at $165 per month:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"There are 4 roses in the vase. There are 7 more dahlias than roses, so there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias. 

To find the total number of flowers, we add the number of roses and dahlias together: 4 + 11 = 15.

Total number of flowers in the vase: 15."
"Given that Harriet is currently 21 years old, we can determine the ages of Adrian and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's age = 21 years.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age = 21 * 2 = 42 years.
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's age = 21 * 3 = 63 years.

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet's age = 21 + 3 = 24 years.
- Zack's age = 42 + 3 = 45 years.
- Adrian's age = 63 + 3 = 66 years.

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \]

The average age of the three in three years is 45 years."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by each of the other students and then subtract their total from the overall score.

1. **Naomi's Score:**
   Naomi scored 68 points.

2. **Yuri's Score:**
   Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \). Adding 10 to this gives Yuri's score: \( 34 + 10 = 44 \).

3. **Brianna's Score:**
   Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's score is \( 68 + 17 = 85 \).

4. **Total Points Scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:**
   Adding up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: \( 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \).

5. **Jojo's Score:**
   The total points scored by all four students is 251. Subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total gives Jojo's score: \( 251 - 197 = 54 \).

**Final Answer:**
Jojo scored 54 points."
"To find out how much time Carmen spent on these games, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on Sudoku puzzles separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- Time to finish one crossword puzzle = 10 minutes
- Number of crossword puzzles solved = 3
- Total time for crossword puzzles = 10 minutes/puzzle * 3 puzzles = 30 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time spent on Sudoku puzzles:
- Time to finish one Sudoku puzzle = 5 minutes
- Number of Sudoku puzzles solved = 8
- Total time for Sudoku puzzles = 5 minutes/puzzle * 8 puzzles = 40 minutes

Now, we add the time spent on both activities:
- Total time = Time for crossword puzzles + Time for Sudoku puzzles
- Total time = 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes

Therefore, Carmen spent 70 minutes playing these games."
"Initially, the water tank has 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters, so the amount of water left in the tank is:

120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters

Celine then collects rainwater, which is twice the amount left in the tank. So, the amount of rainwater collected is:

2 * 30 liters = 60 liters

Adding the rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives:

30 liters + 60 liters = 90 liters

Therefore, the final amount of water in the tank is:

90 liters"
"Andy plants 90 geraniums. He plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, which means he plants 90 - 40 = 50 petunias.

"To travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus, it takes Andrew 6 days. 

To travel from Rochester back to New Jersey by car, it will take half as many days as the bus trip, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days.

So, the total travel time for the round trip is the sum of the bus trip and the car trip:

\[ 6 \text{ days (bus)} + 3 \text{ days (car)} = 9 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, Andrew will travel for 9 days."
"First, let's calculate the new total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type cards and buying 14 grass type cards.

Initial count:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20
- Water type: 40

After the changes:
- Fire type: 30 (unchanged)
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

Now, let's find the total number of cards:
Total cards = 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96

Next, we calculate the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \frac{3200}{96} \]
\[ \text{Percentage} \approx 33.33 \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate the number of watermelons ready for harvest after two months:**
   - 30% of 120 watermelons are ready for harvest.
   - \( 30\% \times 120 = 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \) watermelons.

2. **Calculate the number of watermelons remaining after Ashlyn took the ready ones:**
   - Total watermelons - watermelons taken by Ashlyn = remaining watermelons.
   - \( 120 - 36 = 84 \) watermelons.

3. **Calculate the number of watermelons ready for harvest after two weeks:**
   - 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons are ready for harvest.
   - \( \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \) watermelons.

4. **Calculate the number of watermelons remaining after harvesting the ready ones:**
   - Remaining watermelons - watermelons harvested = remaining watermelons.
   - \( 84 - 63 = 21 \) watermelons.

Therefore, after the two weeks, the number of melons that were not ready to be harvested is 21."
"To calculate the total amount Mark pays for everything, we need to consider the cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees.

1. **Cost of the cars**: 12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000
2. **Tax on the cars**: 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000
3. **Registration fees**: $1,000 per car * 12 cars = $12,000

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total cost:

$240,000 (cost of cars) + $24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (registration fees) = $276,000

"Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. Since he eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes per day. Together, they eat 6 (Steve) + 3 (girlfriend) = 9 tomatoes per day.

To find out how many tomatoes they need in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (days in a week):
9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 tomatoes/week.

Since a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed to produce 63 tomatoes is:
63 tomatoes/week ÷ 3 tomatoes/vine/week = 21 vines.

So, Steve needs 21 vines to produce enough tomatoes for both him and his girlfriend."

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens.
2. **First Cycle of Refilling**: After using these 25 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make 5 new pens (since 25 / 5 = 5).
3. **Second Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 5 new pens plus the 20 pens that were not used up in the first cycle (since 25 - 5 = 20). So, he has 25 pens again. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make 5 new pens again.
4. **Third Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 5 new pens plus the 20 pens that were not used up in the second cycle (since 25 - 5 = 20). So, he has 25 pens again. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make 5 new pens again.
5. **Fourth Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 5 new pens plus the 20 pens that were not used up in the third cycle (since 25 - 5 = 20). So, he has 25 pens again. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make 5 new pens again.
6. **Fifth Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 5 new pens plus the 20 pens that were not used up in the fourth cycle (since 25 - 5 = 20). So, he has 25 pens again. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make 5 new pens again.

After the fifth cycle, he will have 5 new pens plus the 20 pens that were not used up in the fifth cycle (since 25 - 5 = 20). So, he has 25 pens again. However, he cannot make any more new pens because he needs 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen, and he only has 25 pens, which is not enough to make another 5 pens.

So, the total number of pens he can have is the initial 25 pens plus the 5 new pens he made in each of the 5 cycles, which is 25 + 5 * 5 = 25 + 25 = 50.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}

2. Mary is two years younger than Joan.
   - Joan's age = 25
   - Mary's age = Joan's age - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23

Now, to find the sum of the ages of the three girls:
- Jessa's age = 20
- Joan's age = 25
- Mary's age = 23

Sum of their ages = Jessa's age + Joan's age + Mary's age

"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.
2. Calculate the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A.
3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students.
4. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C, which is the remaining students after those who went out through exits A and B.

Let's start with step 1:

1. 30% of the students went out through exit A.
   - 30% of 1000 = 0.30 * 1000 = 300 students.

2. The number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A:

"Dolly has two books, and Pandora has one book. If both Dolly and Pandora read each other's books as well as their own, we need to consider the total number of books read by both of them.

Dolly will read:
- Her own 2 books
- Pandora's 1 book

Pandora will read:
- Her own 1 book
- Dolly's 2 books

So, the total number of books read by Dolly is 2 (her own) + 1 (Pandora's) = 3 books.
The total number of books read by Pandora is 1 (her own) + 2 (Dolly's) = 3 books.

Collectively, they will read 3 (Dolly's total) + 3 (Pandora's total) = 6 books.

By the end, they will collectively read 6 books."
"Mike was originally pen pals with 5 people and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. This means he is now pen pals with 3 people.

Each of these 3 people sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each person sends 10 pages a week (2 letters * 5 pages).

Since Mike is pen pals with 3 people, he receives 30 pages a week (3 people * 10 pages).

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages a week in response.

To find out how many hours he spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total time spent writing 30 pages.

Mike writes a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, to write 30 pages, he spends 30 * 6 = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

So, Mike spends 3 hours writing a week."
"First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason uses for his 15-minute calls with his boss each day. Since there are 30 days in the month, he uses:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes he used for calls to other people:

\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the monthly plan of 1000 minutes:

\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Jason has 250 minutes left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries.
4. Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. So, Griffin now has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than what Kyle took, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Griffin ends up with \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

The total number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 4 + 32 = 36 \).

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

This difference is also stated to be twice the amount of fish in both aquariums combined. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 28 = 2 \times (2F) \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 28 = 4F \]

To find \( F \), we divide both sides by 4:

\[ F = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The number of fish in each aquarium is 7."
"To calculate the total amount Jean paid for the makeup artist's services, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily cost of the makeup artist's services.
2. Calculate the weekly cost of the makeup artist's services.
3. Calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks of the movie.
4. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.

Let's start with the daily cost:

- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
- It takes 6 hours each day to do the makeup.
- Therefore, the daily cost is \( 250 \times 6 = 1500 \) dollars.

Next, we calculate the weekly cost:

- The makeup artist needs to do the makeup 4 times a week.
- Therefore, the weekly cost is \( 1500 \times 4 = 6000 \) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks of the movie:

- The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
- Therefore, the total cost before the discount is \( 6000 \times 5 = 30000 \) dollars.

Finally, we apply the 10% discount:

- The discount is 10% of the total cost.
- Therefore, the discount amount is \( 30000 \times 0.10 = 3000 \) dollars.
- The final amount Jean paid is \( 30000 - 3000 = 27000 \) dollars.

So, Jean paid a total of $27,000."
"To find out how much each person paid, we first need to calculate the total cost of the party supplies. We do this by adding up all the individual expenses:

- Cake ingredients: $12
- Birthday presents: $43
- Decorations: $15
- Invitations: $4
- Goodie bags: $22

Adding these together:

$12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

The total cost of the party supplies is $96. Isabelle split this cost evenly with her two parents, so the cost is divided into three equal parts:

$96 ÷ 3 = $32

Each person paid $32."
"The chef bought 4 bags of onions, with each bag weighing 50 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of onions is:

4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

The cost of onions is $1.50 per pound, so the total cost is:

200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies. Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

In total, Sue ate \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.

Sue's sister ate \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies in total.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories Sue consumed are \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

The total calories Sue's sister consumed are \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.

The difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister is \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories.

Therefore, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."
"To find the number of boys in the third class, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of students in the school:**
   - Each class has 20 students.
   - There are 3 classes.
   - Therefore, the total number of students in the school is \(20 \times 3 = 60\).

2. **Number of boys and girls in the school:**
   - The school is 50% boys and 50% girls.
   - Therefore, the number of boys in the school is \(60 \times 0.5 = 30\).
   - The number of girls in the school is also \(60 \times 0.5 = 30\).

3. **Number of girls in the first and second classes:**
   - The first class has 15 girls.
   - The second class has 12 girls.
   - Therefore, the total number of girls in the first and second classes is \(15 + 12 = 27\).

4. **Number of girls in the third class:**
   - Since there are 30 girls in total and 27 are in the first and second classes, the number of girls in the third class is \(30 - 27 = 3\).

5. **Number of boys in the third class:**
   - Each class has 20 students.
   - The third class has 3 girls.
   - Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is \(20 - 3 = 17\).

**Final answer:**
17 boys are in the third class."
"Travis originally had 61 apps. After deleting 9 apps, he had:

"Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Since he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

Therefore, the number of wolves he killed today is 3 times the number of cougars, which is 3 * 12 = 36 wolves.

Now, let's add up all the animals he killed:

- Wolves: 10 (yesterday) + 36 (today) = 46 wolves
- Cougars: 15 (yesterday) + 12 (today) = 27 cougars

Total animals killed: 46 wolves + 27 cougars = 73 animals.

73 animals"
"Bill starts on the 3rd floor.

"First, we need to determine how many times Anne went down the slide. Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we calculate 30% of Mitchel's 30 times:

\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide 9 times less than Mitchel. Therefore, the number of times Anne went down the slide is:

\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Next, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, so we multiply Anne's count by 4:

\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 84 \]"
"Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, which means there are a total of \(10 \times 20 = 200\) cows.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, each stall gets \(40 \div 20 = 2\) new cows.

After adding the new cows, each stall now has \(20 + 2 = 22\) cows.

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:

\(22 \times 8 = 176\)

Therefore, there are 176 cows in 8 of the stalls."

"First, let's calculate the total number of 10-foot sections in the 200-foot tall redwood:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any of it is:

\[ 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Since termites ate 30% of the redwood, they ate:

\[ 0.30 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 2400 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the remaining weight of the redwood is:

\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 5600 \text{ pounds} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of apples Jamal has:**
   - Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
   - Andrea has 52 apples.
   - Therefore, Jamal has \(52 - 8 = 44\) apples.

2. **Determine the number of bananas Jamal has:**
   - Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.
   - Since Jamal has 44 apples, he has \(44 + 4 = 48\) bananas.

3. **Determine the number of bananas Andrea has:**
   - Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.
   - Since Jamal has 48 bananas, Andrea has \(\frac{48}{2} = 24\) bananas.

4. **Calculate the total number of fruits:**
   - Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, so she has \(52 + 24 = 76\) fruits.
   - Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas, so he has \(44 + 48 = 92\) fruits.

"To determine how many cups of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making over the two days and then find out how much flour is required for that number of cookies.

1. Calculate the total number of cookies:
   - Today: 36 cookies
   - Tomorrow: 30 cookies
   - Total: 36 + 30 = 66 cookies

2. Determine the amount of flour needed for 66 cookies:
   - 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies.
   - To find out how many cups are needed for 66 cookies, we set up a proportion:
     \[
     \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}}
     \]
   - Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{132}{12} = 11 \text{ cups}

\[ 250 + 20 = 270 \]

Therefore, Maddison has 270 marbles now."
"First, let's determine the number of trees Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, and Chris has 6 trees, Ferdinand has:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ trees} \]

Next, we calculate the number of trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has 3 trees, twice that number is:

\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Adding 5 to this number gives:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ trees} \]

Now, to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:

\[ 11 - 3 = 8 \]

So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand.

"To determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then compare it to her budget.

1. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   \[
   \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \text{ of } \$350,000 = 0.05 \times 350,000 = \$17,500
   \]

2. **Calculate the transfer fee:**
   \[
   \text{Transfer fee} = 12\% \text{ of } \$350,000 = 0.12 \times 350,000 = \$42,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total price of the house:**
   \[
   \text{Total price} = \text{Selling price} + \text{Brokerage fee} + \text{Transfer fee} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = \$409,500
   \]

4. **Determine how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:**
   \[

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to subtract the transfer fees, brokerage fees, and the remaining loan amount from the selling price.

1. **Calculate the transfer fees:**
   Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000
   = 0.03 * $400,000
   = $12,000

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000
   = 0.05 * $400,000
   = $20,000

3. **Calculate the total fees:**
   Total fees = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee
   = $12,000 + $20,000
   = $32,000

4. **Calculate the net proceeds:**
   Net proceeds = Selling price - Total fees - Remaining loan amount
   = $400,000 - $32,000 - $250,000
   = $118,000

Therefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are $118,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and calculate the time for each part.

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:** This takes 20 minutes.

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:** It takes 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees. 
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:** It takes 5 minutes less time than the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - The total heating time to 400 degrees is 28 minutes.
   - So, the cooking time is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

4. **Total time from start to finish:** This is the sum of the heating time to 300 degrees, the additional heating time to 400 degrees, and the cooking time.
   - Total time = \(20 + 28 + 23 = 71\) minutes.

Therefore, the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 71 minutes."
"To find out how much the real estate agent spent on all the ads, we need to calculate the total cost for the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the newspaper ads:
- The cost per newspaper ad is $5.
- The number of newspaper ads bought is 50.
- Therefore, the total cost for newspaper ads is \(5 \times 50 = 250\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the television ads:
- The cost per television ad is $75.
- The number of television ads bought is 15.
- Therefore, the total cost for television ads is \(75 \times 15 = 1125\) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs for the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost for newspaper ads + Cost for television ads
- Total cost = \(250 + 1125 = 1375\) dollars.

The real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on buying all the ads."
"The juggler can juggle 16 balls in total. Half of these balls are golf balls, so there are 16 / 2 = 8 golf balls. Half of these golf balls are blue, so there are 8 / 2 = 4 blue golf balls.

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has \(300 / 2 = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, we add the M&Ms from all three bags together:
\[300 + 312 + 150 = 762\]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. John has 2 houses.
2. Each house has 3 bedrooms.
3. Each bedroom has 2 windows.
4. There are an additional 4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms.

First, calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:
- Each house has 3 bedrooms.
- Each bedroom has 2 windows.
- Therefore, each house has \(3 \times 2 = 6\) windows in the bedrooms.

Since there are 2 houses, the total number of bedroom windows is:
- \(2 \times 6 = 12\) windows.

Next, calculate the number of additional windows in each house:
- Each house has 4 additional windows.
- Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is:
- \(2 \times 4 = 8\) windows.

Now, add the number of bedroom windows and the additional windows to get the total number of windows:
- Total windows = bedroom windows + additional windows
- Total windows = \(12 + 8 = 20\)

Therefore, the total number of windows between the houses is 20."
"To find out how much change the cashier gives back, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items the mother bought. 

The cost of cocoa is $4.20, the cost of laundry is $9.45, and the cost of the package of pasta is $1.35. Adding these amounts together:

\[ 4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35 = 15.00 \]

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first calculate the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette, and then subtract these from the total number of stitches to find the number of stitches for the sleeves.

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, so:
   \[
   \text{Collar stitches} = \frac{900}{10} = 90
   \]
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so:
   \[
   \text{Rosette stitches} = 2 \times 90 = 180
   \]
4. The total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. Subtracting the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette from the total gives us the stitches for the sleeves:
   \[
   \text{Sleeves stitches} = 1800 - (900 + 90 + 180) = 1800 - 1170 = 630
   \]
5. Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total sleeve stitches by 2:
   \[
   \text{Stitches per sleeve} = \frac{630}{2} = 315
   \]

Each sleeve takes 315 stitches."
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the tomato seeds:
- Number of tomato seed packets: 20
- Cost per packet of tomato seeds: $40
- Total cost for tomato seeds = 20 packets * $40/packet = $800

Next, let's calculate the cost for the celery seeds:
- Number of celery seed packets: 80
- Cost per packet of celery seeds: $30
- Total cost for celery seeds = 80 packets * $30/packet = $2400

Now, we add the total costs for both types of seeds:
- Total cost for tomato seeds: $800
- Total cost for celery seeds: $2400
- Total cost for all seeds = $800 + $2400 = $3200

Therefore, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is $3200."
"To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each part and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\) lines from the first scene.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\) lines from the second scene.

Now, we sum up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
- Solo song: 54 lines
- First scene: 36 lines
- Second scene: 48 lines

Total lines = \(54 + 36 + 48 = 138\)

"First, let's calculate the number of cards with the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

So, 32 cards had the letter A on them.

Next, we find out how many cards are left after removing the cards with the letter A:

\[ 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Now, 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B on them. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

This means 24 cards had the letter B on them.

We then find out how many cards are left after removing the cards with the letter B:

\[ 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Next, 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C on them. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

This means 15 cards had the letter C on them.

Finally, to find out how many cards had the letter D on them, we subtract the number of cards with letters A, B, and C from the total number of cards:

\[ 80 - (32 + 24 + 15) = 80 - 71 = 9 \]

So, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To calculate the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time for digging small holes:
   - Time for one small hole = 3 minutes
   - Total time for 30 small holes = 30 * 3 minutes = 90 minutes

2. Calculate the total time for digging large holes:
   - Time for one large hole = 10 minutes
   - Total time for 15 large holes = 15 * 10 minutes = 150 minutes

3. Add the total times for small and large holes:
   - Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

4. Convert the total time from minutes to hours:
   - 240 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 4 hours

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes."
"The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 20 + 20 = 40.

40"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

Sam is currently 6 years old."
"To find out how much Peter paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the popsicles:
- Peter purchased 20 popsicles.
- Each popsicle costs $0.25.
- Therefore, the total cost for the popsicles is \(20 \times 0.25 = 5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars:
- Peter purchased 4 ice cream bars.
- Each ice cream bar costs $0.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the ice cream bars is \(4 \times 0.50 = 2\) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:
- Total cost = Cost of popsicles + Cost of ice cream bars
- Total cost = \(5 + 2 = 7\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount Peter paid is \(\boxed{7}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine the number of spots on a mamba. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can calculate the number of spots on a mamba as follows:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots on all the cobras. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots on cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

Then, we calculate the total number of spots on all the mambas. There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots on mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we add the total spots on cobras and mambas to get the combined total number of spots:

\[ \text{Combined total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we find half of the combined total number of spots:

\[ \text{Half the combined total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2450 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people at the soccer game. There are 12 team members and each brings 2 guests, so the guests total to 12 * 2 = 24 guests. Adding the 12 team members and 3 coaches, the total number of people is 12 + 24 + 3 = 39 people.

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3: 39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

Finally, to find out how much Maddy will spend, we multiply the number of pizzas by the cost per pizza: 13 * $15 = $195.

Maddy will spend $195."
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones.
2. Subtract this length from the total length of the necklace to find the length occupied by the sterling silver beads.
3. Divide the length occupied by the sterling silver beads by the length of each bead to find the number of beads.

Let's start with step 1. Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace, and each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long. Therefore, the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones is:
\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we move to step 2. The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. Subtracting the length occupied by the topaz gemstones, we get the length occupied by the sterling silver beads:
\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

Finally, for step 3, each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find the number of beads, we divide the length occupied by the beads by the length of each bead:
\[ \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{\frac{1}{4} \text{ inch/bead}} = 17 \times 4 = 68 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. 

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we add the stories from both weeks:
- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Adding these together gives us the total number of stories:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents.

Kelly has 5 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the total value of the quarters is:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly also has 2 dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, the total value of the dimes is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the value of the quarters and dimes together gives:
\[ 125 + 20 = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how many cents she has left, we subtract the cost of the pop from her total amount of money:
\[ 145 - 55 = 90 \text{ cents} \]

So, Kelly will have \(\boxed{90}\) cents left."
"To find the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars and then subtract the stars in the other rows.

1. Calculate the total number of stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and 2 rows of 6 stars:
   - 3 rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars
   - 2 rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars
   - Total stars in these rows: \(24 + 12 = 36\) stars

2. The flag has 76 stars in total. Subtract the 36 stars from the other rows to find the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
   - Stars in 5-star rows: \(76 - 36 = 40\) stars

3. To find the number of 5-star rows, divide the number of stars in 5-star rows by 5:
   - Number of 5-star rows: \(40 \div 5 = 8\)

Therefore, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag."
"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, we first need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight for 80 flagstones is:

\[ 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to carry this total weight, given that each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds. We do this by dividing the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks} \]

Therefore, the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip is:

"Let's break down the points for each player after the first three rounds and then add the extra points for the fourth round.

1. **Mike's Points:**
   - After 3 rounds: 21 points
   - Extra point in the fourth round: Since Mike has over 20 points, he gets an extra point.
   - Total points for Mike: 21 + 1 = 22 points

2. **Jim's Points:**
   - After 3 rounds: 3 points less than Mike, so 21 - 3 = 18 points
   - Extra point in the fourth round: Since Jim has 18 points, he does not get an extra point.
   - Total points for Jim: 18 points

3. **Tony's Points:**
   - After 3 rounds: 2 times more than Mike, so 21 * 2 = 42 points
   - Extra point in the fourth round: Since Tony has over 20 points, he gets an extra point.
   - Total points for Tony: 42 + 1 = 43 points

Now, let's add up the total points for all three players after the fourth round:

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members, each consuming 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and eating rice at both lunch and dinner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily rice consumption for the household.
2. Determine the total weekly rice consumption.
3. Calculate how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

**Step 1: Calculate the total daily rice consumption for the household.**

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since each person eats rice at both lunch and dinner, each person consumes:
\[ 0.2 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 0.4 \, \text{kg/day} \]

For 5 members of the household, the total daily consumption is:
\[ 0.4 \, \text{kg/person/day} \times 5 \, \text{persons} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total weekly rice consumption.**

There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly consumption is:
\[ 2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{kg/week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.**

To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

- Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates.
- On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
- On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
- On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

Now, let's add these numbers together:

20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:

120 (target) - 65 (sold) = 55 crates

So, Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week."
"To determine the total cost of the antique desk for Carmen, we need to calculate the sum of all the bids she made. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Bid**: Carmen starts with an opening bid of $200.
2. **Bids by Others**: There are 3 other people who each bid once. Since the bids rise by $50 each time, the bids by the other people are:
   - First other person: $200 + $50 = $250
   - Second other person: $250 + $50 = $300
   - Third other person: $300 + $50 = $350

3. **Carmen's Bids**: Carmen bids after each of the other people, so her bids are:
   - After the first other person: $300
   - After the second other person: $350
   - After the third other person: $400

4. **Total Cost**: The total cost is the sum of all the bids Carmen made, including the initial bid and her subsequent bids:

"To find out the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of books sold in the first year.
2. Determine the number of books sold in the second year.
3. Calculate the earnings from the books sold in the second year.

First, we know that Elise started with 250 books and currently has 50 unsold books. This means she has sold \(250 - 50 = 200\) books in total over the three years.

We are also given that she sold 45 books in the current (third) year. According to the problem, she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. Therefore, she sold \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books in the first year.

Now, we can find out how many books she sold in the second year by subtracting the books sold in the first and third years from the total books sold:
\[200 - 90 - 45 = 65\]

Since each book sells for $20, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is:
\[65 \times 20 = 1300\]

So, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is:
\[
\boxed{1300}

"Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so he loses 2 pounds per week (8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds/week).

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds (the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks), we can set up the following:

If Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks, then to lose 8 pounds, we can calculate the number of weeks as follows:

\( \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds/4 weeks}} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ weeks} \)

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

"To determine the number of new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many extra arms and legs they will grow based on the given intervals.

- Extra arms grow every 3 days.
- Extra legs grow every 5 days.

First, let's calculate the number of extra arms grown in 15 days:
- The number of 3-day intervals in 15 days is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).
- So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

Next, let's calculate the number of extra legs grown in 15 days:
- The number of 5-day intervals in 15 days is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).
- So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

Now, we add the number of extra arms and legs to find the total number of new limbs:
- Total new limbs = 5 (extra arms) + 3 (extra legs) = 8.

Therefore, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, the cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
\[ 5 \times \$100 + \$700 = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

The total amount Theo wants to save is $2000. Therefore, the total amount he can spend on the trip is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

Now, let's sum up the costs of the suits, suitcases, and flight ticket:
\[ \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$2050 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the number of people eating three eggs each day:**
   - There are 3 people eating 3 eggs each day.

2. **Calculate the total number of eggs these 3 people consume in a day:**
   - \(3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person} = 9 \text{ eggs}\).

3. **Identify the number of people eating two eggs each day:**
   - The family has 5 people in total, and 3 of them are already accounted for, so \(5 - 3 = 2 \text{ people}\) are eating 2 eggs each day.

4. **Calculate the total number of eggs these 2 people consume in a day:**
   - \(2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person} = 4 \text{ eggs}\).

5. **Calculate the total number of eggs the entire family consumes in a day:**
   - \(9 \text{ eggs} + 4 \text{ eggs} = 13 \text{ eggs}\).

6. **Calculate the total number of eggs the family consumes in a week (7 days):**
   - \(13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 91 \text{ eggs}\).

Therefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"If Quinn is 30 years old, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, then Jane is:

30 - 3 = 27 years old.

Since Trent is 5 years older than Jane, Trent's age is:

27 + 5 = 32 years old.

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old."
"Given that Cera is currently 46 years old, six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.

Let's denote Noah's age six years ago as \( N \). According to the problem, six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ N = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, Noah was 20 years old six years ago. This means Noah's current age is \( 20 + 6 = 26 \) years old.

The problem also states that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time. Therefore, the population of Chile six years ago was:
\[ 3000 \times 20 = 60000 \]

Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now, the current population of Chile is:
\[ 60000 \times 2 = 120000 \]

Therefore, the population of Chile now is:
\[ 120000 \]"
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem, the number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).

The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{1}{2}D \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3.5D = 105 \]

To find \( D \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3.5:

\[ D = \frac{105}{3.5} = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

Final numerical answer:
30"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

Total invited: \(12 + 12 = 24\) people

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness

Now, we calculate the number of people who had previous commitments:

- 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) people

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is:

- 8 (due to illness) + 2 (previous commitments) = 10 people

Finally, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited to find out how many people show up:

- Total invited: 24
- People who couldn't come: 10

People who show up: \(24 - 10 = 14\)

"First, let's calculate the number of marbles Solomon received from his father. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, and his father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought. So, the number of marbles his father gave him is:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8
\]

Now, let's find the total number of marbles Solomon has. He initially had 50 marbles in the store, bought 20 more from Johanna, and received 8 more from his father. Therefore, the total number of marbles is:

\[
50 + 20 + 8 = 78
\]

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of the marbles is:

\[
78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kgs}
\]

The total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is:

\[
\boxed{156}

"To calculate the cost to fill the pool, we first need to determine the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep, so the volume \( V \) is calculated as:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \times 5 \, \text{ft} \]
\[ V = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

The cost to fill the pool is $.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = V \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{\$/cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 12 \, \text{\$} \]

The cost to fill the pool is $12."
"Given that the classroom has 30 boys, we can use the information provided to find the number of girls and nongendered children.

1. The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys:
   \[ \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

2. The number of nongendered children is 1/10 the number of boys:
   \[ \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \]

To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
\[ \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

Total number of children: 123"
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

1. Let the number of electric poles be \( P \) and the number of electric wires be \( W \).
2. According to the ratio, \( P:W = 1:3 \).
3. This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.
4. Given \( W = 45 \), we can set up the proportion: \( \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \).
5. Substituting \( W = 45 \) into the proportion, we get \( \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \).
6. Solving for \( P \), we multiply both sides by 45: \( P = \frac{45}{3} \).
7. Therefore, \( P = 15 \).

The total number of electric poles required is 15."
"At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, 1/4 of 40 people is 10 people.

This means 30 people stayed at the party (40 - 10 = 30).

We are told that 22 men stayed at the party. Since there were originally 25 men, the number of men who left is 3 (25 - 22 = 3).

Since 10 people in total left and 3 of them were men, the number of women who left is 7 (10 - 3 = 7).

Originally, there were 15 women, so the number of women who stayed is 8 (15 - 7 = 8).

Therefore, the number of women left at the party is 8."
"The magazine costs half as much as a book, and the book costs $4. So, the magazine costs:

\[ 2 - 1 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

The pen costs $1."
"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. According to the problem, Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together give a total of 26 pencils. 

We can set up the equation for Jam's pencils as follows:
\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + \text{Loose pencils} = \text{Total pencils} \]
\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + 2 = 26 \]

To find the number of pencils in the boxes, we subtract 2 from 26:
\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} = 26 - 2 = 24 \]

Now, we know that Jam has 24 pencils in boxes and 2 loose pencils, making a total of 26 pencils.

Next, we consider Meg's pencils. The problem states that Meg has 46 pencils.

To find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils, we first need to determine the total number of pencils they have together:
\[ \text{Total pencils} = \text{Jam's pencils} + \text{Meg's pencils} \]
\[ \text{Total pencils} = 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Assuming each box can hold the same number of pencils as the boxes Jam has (which hold 24 pencils each), we need to find out how many such boxes are needed to store 72 pencils. We do this by dividing the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:
\[ \text{Number of boxes needed} = \frac{\text{Total pencils}}{\text{Pencils per box}} \]
\[ \text{Number of boxes needed} = \frac{72}{24} = 3 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 3 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to calculate the total weakening effect from the ice cubes and the cream added.

First, let's calculate the weakening effect from the ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Shannon's coffee is cooled by 65 degrees. To find out how many ice cubes are used, we divide the total cooling by the cooling effect per ice cube:

\[ \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, the total weakening effect from the ice cubes is:

\[ \text{Weakening from ice cubes} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters} \]

Next, we need to account for the weakening effect from the cream. Adding 15 milliliters of cream further weakens the coffee. Therefore, the total weakening effect is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:

\[ \text{Total weakening} = 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio and apply it to the number of new records the people received.

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means for every new record received, 2 old records are given up.

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records given up as follows:

\[ \text{Total old records} = 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior programmers. Given that the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, and the total number of employees is 100, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total monthly payment to junior programmers is:

\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so their monthly payment is:

\[ \text{Monthly payment to senior programmers} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

The total monthly payment to senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:

\[ \text{Total payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:

\[ \boxed{224000} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal be \( x \).

2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).

3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the total number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

4. Simplifying the expression, we get \( x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

5. We know that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, \( x + 6 = 20 \).

6. Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 20 - 6 = 14 \).

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

3. He passes 14 out to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\).
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends: \(14 \times 2 = 28\). Adding these to the 8 he has left: \(8 + 28 = 36\).
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\).
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\).

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31."
"To fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, it needs an additional 40 percentage points of charge. Given that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to recharge the remaining 40 percentage points.

\[ \text{Time (in minutes)} = 40 \times 3 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert this time into hours:

\[ \text{Time (in hours)} = \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."

On this shopping trip, the customer spent $43 and used their $4 rewards. However, they also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the coupon took \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars off the price.

The total discount from the rewards and the coupon is:

\[ 4 + 8 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting this discount from the $43 spent:

\[ 43 - 12 = 31 \text{ dollars} \]

"To determine which job has a higher net pay and by how much, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per year: 2000
- Annual gross pay: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Tax rate: 20%
- Annual tax: $30,000 * 20% = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual gross pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate: 10%
- Annual tax: $36,000 * 10% = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate, which is Job B.

\[ \text{Number of ruined castles} = 220 \times \frac{40}{100} = 220 \times 0.4 = 88 \]

Next, we find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. Since half of the ruined castles are unmanned:

\[ \text{Number of unmanned ruined castles} = 88 \times \frac{1}{2} = 44 \]

So, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is 44."

"First, let's calculate the value of the shares after the first year. Maria initially buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the initial total value is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price per share after the increase, we calculate:

\[ \$8 \times 1.50 = \$12 \]

So, the value of the 8 shares after the first year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To find the new price per share after the decrease, we calculate:

\[ \$12 \times 0.75 = \$9 \]

So, the value of the 8 shares after the second year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72 \]

Therefore, the final value of all Maria's shares is:

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group will then have \( x - 10 \) students.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group, therefore, has:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( C \) represent the number of cows and \( H \) represent the number of chickens. According to the problem, Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so we can write:
\[ H = 2C \]

We also know that the total number of animals is 60, so:
\[ C + H = 60 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ \text{Total legs} = 4C + 2H \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is:

3 (initial balls) + 4 (balls added each week for 4 weeks) = 7 balls

However, during the performance, he drops 3 balls. So, the number of balls he has left is:

7 - 3 = 4 balls

But 2 of those balls are caught by people in the crowd, so he still has:

4 - 2 = 2 balls

Therefore, Josh starts to juggle with 2 balls."
"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, so:
   - Blue beetle = 50 pounds
   - Green toad = 50 pounds

2. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so:
   - Yellow snake = 50 + 10 = 60 pounds

3. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so:
   - Red bird = 50 - 20 = 30 pounds

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the container itself, which weighs 20 pounds.

Total weight = Weight of pink frog + Weight of blue beetle + Weight of green toad + Weight of yellow snake + Weight of red bird + Weight of container
Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20
Total weight = 260 pounds

The total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, plus the container itself, is 260 pounds."

"To determine the percentage increase in daily earnings, we first need to calculate the daily earnings from tractors and from silos.

1. **Daily earnings from tractors:**
   - Number of tractors sold per day: 10
   - Price per tractor: $100
   - Daily earnings from tractors: \(10 \times 100 = 1000\) dollars

2. **Daily earnings from silos:**
   - Number of silos sold per day: 5
   - Price per silo: $220
   - Daily earnings from silos: \(5 \times 220 = 1100\) dollars

3. **Percentage increase in daily earnings:**
   - Increase in daily earnings: \(1100 - 1000 = 100\) dollars
   - Percentage increase: \(\frac{100}{1000} \times 100 = 10\%\)

The factory is making 10% more per day now."
"To calculate the total amount Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to break down the costs for each item and then sum them up for a year.

1. **Food Cost:**
   - Food costs $25 per week.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost for food is \(25 \times 4 = 100\) dollars.
   - For a year, the cost for food is \(100 \times 12 = 1200\) dollars.

2. **Treats Cost:**
   - Treats cost $20 per month.
   - For a year, the cost for treats is \(20 \times 12 = 240\) dollars.

3. **Medicine Cost:**
   - Medicine costs $100 per month.
   - For a year, the cost for medicine is \(100 \times 12 = 1200\) dollars.

Now, we sum up all the yearly costs:
- Yearly cost for food: $1200
- Yearly cost for treats: $240
- Yearly cost for medicine: $1200

Total yearly cost = \(1200 + 240 + 1200 = 2640\) dollars.

"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming. He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Next, he watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is:

\[ 3 \times 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let's denote the total time spent on vacation as \( T \). Therefore, we have:

\[ 0.30T = 15 \text{ hours} \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ hours}}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. So, the time spent sightseeing is:

\[ 0.40 \times 50 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time John spent sightseeing is:

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost for Morgan and her friends to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. Then, we'll subtract this total from her budget to see how much money is left for her friends.

1. **Cost of mini-golf for one person**: $5
2. **Cost of go-karts for one person (2 rides at $10 each)**: $10 * 2 = $20
3. **Total cost for one person (mini-golf + go-karts)**: $5 + $20 = $25
4. **Total cost for one person (mini-golf + go-karts + $5 in arcade tokens)**: $25 + $5 = $30

Now, let's assume Morgan is one of the people attending the party. We need to find out how much money is left for her friends after accounting for her own expenses.

5. **Morgan's total cost**: $30
6. **Total budget**: $90
7. **Money left for friends**: $90 - $30 = $60

Each friend will also need to cover the cost of $30 (mini-golf + go-karts + $5 in arcade tokens).

8. **Number of friends Morgan can invite**: $60 / $30 = 2

Therefore, Morgan can invite 2 friends to her birthday party."
"Marisa gets $5 every day as pocket money. She spends 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so the total cost of the lollipops is:

4 lollipops * $0.25 per lollipop = $1.00

The amount she saves each day is the difference between her pocket money and the cost of the lollipops:

$5.00 - $1.00 = $4.00

If she saves for 5 days, the total amount she saves is:

$4.00 per day * 5 days = $20.00

Therefore, Marisa puts $20.00 in her piggy bank if she saves for 5 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount Billy spent on gumballs:**
   - Each gumball costs $0.05.
   - Billy bought 40 gumballs.
   - Total cost for gumballs = 40 * $0.05 = $2.

2. **Calculate the change Billy had before buying gumballs:**
   - Billy initially had $10.
   - He spent $2 on gumballs.
   - Change before buying gumballs = $10 - $2 = $8.

3. **Determine the amount of money Billy had after buying gumballs:**
   - Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs.
   - Half of his change = $8 / 2 = $4.
   - Therefore, the amount of money he had after buying gumballs = $8 - $4 = $4.

4. **Calculate the amount spent on candy:**
   - The total amount Billy had initially was $10.
   - After buying gumballs, he had $4 left.
   - Amount spent on candy = $10 - $4 = $6.

5. **Determine the number of pounds of candy Billy bought:**
   - The candy costs $1.5 per pound.
   - Amount spent on candy = $6.
   - Number of pounds of candy = $6 / $1.5 = 4 pounds.

**Final numerical answer:**
Billy bought 4 pounds of candy."
"Let's denote Carver's age as \( C \) and his son's age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Carver just turned 45 years old, so \( C = 45 \).
2. Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age, which can be written as \( C = 2S - 5 \).

Substituting the value of \( C \) into the second equation:
\[ 45 = 2S - 5 \]

To find \( S \), we solve the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2S \]
\[ 50 = 2S \]
\[ S = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ S = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: \(75 + 100 - 50 = 125\) miles

So, the total distance for one trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance traveled is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles/day}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily distance:
\[\frac{18000}{900} = 20 \text{ days}\]

Therefore, the train goes between services every 20 days."

The minimum number of points she must score on the third test to pass is 9."
"First, let's determine the number of people kicked out for shoplifting. We know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks. The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times that number minus 5. So, we calculate:

\[ 4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

Next, we calculate the number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. This number is three times the number of shoplifters:

\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we know the total number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence over goods on sale. Adding these together, we get:

\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

If the total number of people kicked out is 50, then the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:

\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total cost for the senior gifts, we need to break down the expenses into different categories and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20.
   - Total cost for picture frames = 44 seniors * $20 = $880.

2. **Cost of etching the picture frames:**
   - Each picture frame incurs an additional 20% cost for etching.
   - Additional cost per frame = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4.
   - Total etching cost = 44 seniors * $4 = $176.

3. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - Total cost for pins = 2 seniors * $5 = $10.

4. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so the number of officers = 1/4 * 44 = 11.
   - Each officer receives a cord that costs $12.
   - Total cost for cords = 11 officers * $12 = $132.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of picture frames + Cost of etching + Cost of pins + Cost of cords
- Total cost = $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1,198.

Therefore, the total amount spent on the senior gifts is $1,198."

"On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday, which is:
\[ 14 \times 2 = 28 \text{ pairs} \]

On the last day of the sale, they sold one-half the amount that they did on Saturday, which is:
\[ 28 \div 2 = 14 \text{ pairs} \]

However, six pairs were returned because they didn't fit, so the actual number of pairs sold on the last day is:
\[ 14 - 6 = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

To find the total number of pairs sold during the sale, we add the pairs sold on each day:
\[ 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \text{ pairs} \]

Therefore, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is:
50 pairs.

Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is:

First, we calculate the number of sheep in each group:
- Half of 30 sheep is 15 sheep.

For the first half (15 sheep):
- Each sheep produces 1 kg of milk.
- So, 15 sheep * 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg of milk.

For the second half (15 sheep):
- Each sheep produces 2 kg of milk.
- So, 15 sheep * 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg of milk.

"To find out how many pupils like the color yellow, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pupils who like blue.
2. Determine the number of pupils remaining after those who like blue are accounted for.
3. Calculate the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils.
4. Subtract the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils to find out how many like yellow.

Let's start with step 1:
- Half of the class likes blue, so we calculate \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) pupils like blue.

Next, step 2:
- After accounting for the 20 pupils who like blue, we have \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) pupils remaining.

For step 3:
- One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so we calculate \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) pupils like green.

Finally, step 4:
- The number of pupils who like yellow is the remaining pupils after those who like blue and green are accounted for, which is \( 20 - 5 = 15 \).

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest for the five months. The interest rate is 10% per year, so for five months, the interest rate is:

\[ \text{Interest rate for 5 months} = \frac{10\% \times 5}{12} = \frac{10}{12}\% = \frac{10}{1200} = \frac{1}{120} \]

Now, we calculate the interest on the principal amount of $3,650:

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times \frac{1}{120} = 30.4167 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 30.4167 = 3680.4167 \]

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3680.4167}{5} = 736.08334 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:

\[ \boxed{736.08} \]"

Now, we need to calculate the total cost. Millie spent $18 on supplies. So, the total cost is:

\[ \$18 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she sells all the lemonade, we can determine the profit per hour by dividing the total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade. First, we find out how many hours it takes to sell all 36 cups:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we calculate the profit per hour:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

So, the profit Millie makes per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:

\[ \$2 \]"
"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he kept \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land. The amount of land he kept is given as 12.8 hectares.

So, we can write the equation as:
\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]
\[ x = 32 \]

Therefore, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 52 * 50% = 52 * 0.5 = 26

The performance is done by the female members, so initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform. However, on the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

Number of girls who can't make it = 26 * 0.5 = 13

So, the number of girls who actually perform is:

Number of girls who perform = 26 - 13 = 13

Additionally, 3 teachers decide to sing with the girls. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Total number of people who sang = Number of girls who perform + Number of teachers = 13 + 3 = 16

Final numerical answer:
16"

"To find the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of 6 erasers.
2. Calculate the cost of 8 pencils.
3. Add the two amounts together to get the total cost.

Step 1: Cost of 6 erasers
Each eraser costs $2, so 6 erasers cost \(6 \times 2 = 12\) dollars.

Step 2: Cost of 8 pencils
Each pencil costs $3, so 8 pencils cost \(8 \times 3 = 24\) dollars.

Step 3: Total cost
Adding the cost of the erasers and pencils together, we get \(12 + 24 = 36\) dollars.

Therefore, the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is $36."
"James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson.

To find out how many messages he delivers to Mr. Yu, we calculate 1/3 of 66:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

So, James delivers 22 messages to Mr. Yu.

To find the total number of messages delivered, we add the messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu:
\[ 66 + 22 = 88 \]

Therefore, the total number of messages James delivers is 88."
"To determine how much money David saves, let's break down the costs for both David and Dasha.

First, let's calculate the cost for Dasha:
- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, each ride costs \(2 \times 2 = $4\).
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \times 4 = $36\).

Now, let's calculate the cost for David:
- David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.
- Therefore, the total cost for David is $30.

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract the cost for David from the cost for Dasha:
- The savings for David is \(36 - 30 = $6\).

So, David saves $6."
"First, let's calculate the total number of gifts Monica needs to wrap:

- Gifts for her family: 6
- Gifts for her friends: 4
- Gifts for her teachers: 2

Total number of gifts = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to make bows for all 12 gifts. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each bow, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of gifts:

144 inches of ribbon ÷ 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given ratio and the total number of popsicles to find out how many popsicles each person has.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of popsicles is the sum of Betty's and Sam's popsicles:
\[5x + 6x = 165\]
\[11x = 165\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 11:
\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles.
- Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[90 - 75 = 15\]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services before the bundle discount:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu costs $10 a month.
- Disney Plus costs $10 a month.

So, the total cost for these three services before the discount is:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount for bundling these services. The discount amount is:
\[ 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we compare this to the cost of the cable package, which is $60 per month. The savings by cancelling the cable package and subscribing to the streaming services is:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars per month} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's break down the time Carol spends on each activity:

1. Writing a song: 4 hours
2. Recording: half the time spent writing, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) hours
3. Editing: 90 minutes, which is \( \frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \) hours

Now, let's calculate the total work time:

Total work time = Time spent writing + Time spent recording + Time spent editing
Total work time = 4 hours + 2 hours + 1.5 hours
Total work time = 7.5 hours

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the total work time was spent editing. The time spent editing is 1.5 hours, so the percentage is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Percentage spent editing} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total work time}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage spent editing} = \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage spent editing} = 0.2 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage spent editing} = 20\% \]

So, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, calculate the total number of spaces available in the shelving system. Since the system has 6 rows and 6 columns, the total number of spaces is:
   \[
   6 \times 6 = 36
   \]

2. Next, we need to determine how many books Wendy wants to place. According to the problem, she wants to place 20 more than double the number of spaces. So, we calculate double the number of spaces and then add 20:

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry \(\boxed{92}\) books to complete her task."
"First, let's calculate the total number of Valentine's cards Erica initially had:

- Erica made 20 cards.
- Her dad brought 2 boxes with 15 cards each, so that's \(2 \times 15 = 30\) cards.

Adding these together, Erica started with \(20 + 30 = 50\) cards.

Next, we account for the cards she passed out and received:

- She passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
- She passed out 5 cards to her family.
- She received 17 cards from family and friends.

So, the total number of cards she gave away is \(24 + 5 = 29\).

The net change in the number of cards she has is the cards she received minus the cards she gave away, which is \(17 - 29 = -12\).

Therefore, the final number of Valentine's cards Erica has is \(50 - 29 - 12 = 9\).

Erica now has 9 Valentine's Day cards."
"First, let's calculate how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Next, she gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices herself. So, we subtract the slices she eats from the total number of slices:
\[ 12 - 7 - 2 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the number of slices left is:
\[ 3 \]"

"First, let's calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when it is used for 8 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. Therefore, for 8 hours, the energy consumption is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the energy consumption to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Now, if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, the air conditioner will be used for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

The energy consumption for 3 hours is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Therefore, the total kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:
\[ 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]"
"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total payment for May.
2. Determine the number of employees remaining after June.
3. Calculate the total payment for June.
4. Sum the payments from May and June.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**

- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment for May = Number of employees × Hourly wage × Hours worked per week
\[ 40 \times 15 \times 40 = 24000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of employees remaining after June.**

- 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired in June.
- Number of employees who left = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \)
- Number of employees remaining = 40 - 10 = 30

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for June.**

- Number of employees in June: 30
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment for June = Number of employees × Hourly wage × Hours worked per week
\[ 30 \times 15 \times 40 = 18000 \]

**Step 4: Sum the payments from May and June.**

Total payment for May and June = Payment for May + Payment for June

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. So, the first pound of taffy costs $3, and the second pound is half off, which means it costs $3 / 2 = $1.50. Therefore, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashell bag, which is $1.50.

Then, we calculate the cost of the 4 magnets, each costing $0.25. So, the total cost for the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Taffy: $4.50
- Seashell bag: $1.50
- Magnets: $1.00

Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

Sally started with $10.00. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is:
$10.00 - $7.00 = $3.00

"First, let's calculate the cost of the second pack of fireworks. Since it's worth twice the amount of the first pack, which is $400, the second pack costs:

\[ 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

Next, we add the cost of the first and second packs of fireworks:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Now, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the first and second packs. A 20% discount means he pays 80% of the original price. So, we calculate 80% of $1200:

\[ 1200 \times 0.80 = 960 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted total:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. To find out how many cookies she needs for 30 days, we multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of days:

\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies she needs to make 60 cookies:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the problem does not provide a direct percentage for candles that explode. Instead, it gives us a guarantee that the candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which implies that 1% of the candles might explode.

Given:
- Total number of candles = 50,000
- Percentage of candles that might explode = 1%
- Percentage of candles that smell like wet dog = 5% of the more dangerous candles

Since the problem does not specify how many of the candles are ""more dangerous,"" we can assume that the 5% of candles that smell like wet dog are a subset of the candles that might explode. Therefore, we can directly use the 1% that might explode and find the overlap with the 5% that smell like wet dog.

First, calculate the number of candles that might explode:
\[ 1\% \text{ of } 50,000 = \frac{1}{100} \times 50,000 = 500 \]

Next, calculate the number of candles that smell like wet dog:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 50,000 = \frac{5}{100} \times 50,000 = 2,500 \]

Since the problem does not specify the exact overlap, we assume the worst-case scenario where all candles that smell like wet dog are also the ones that might explode. Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and might explode is the minimum of the two calculated numbers, which is 500.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{500} \]"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount price of one blouse.
2. Multiply the discount price by the number of blouses Misha picked.

First, let's calculate the discount price of one blouse. The original price of each blouse is $20, and they are on a 30% off rack. So, the discount amount per blouse is:

\[ 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

This means each blouse is discounted by $6. Therefore, the price of one discounted blouse is:

\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Now, Misha picks out 4 blouses. So, the total cost for 4 blouses is:

\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples.
3. Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as \(x\).

Joanne's total apples = \(30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\).

Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
Joanne's sister gathers no apples from the average trees.

Joanne's sister's total apples = \(60 + 45 = 105\).

The combined total of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[45 + x + 105 = 500\]

Simplifying the left side:
\[150 + x = 500\]

Subtract 150 from both sides to solve for \(x\):
\[x = 500 - 150\]
\[x = 350\]

Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of heads is 180, which means \( C + D = 180 \).
2. The total number of humps is 304, which means \( 2C + D = 304 \) because camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump.

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can express \( D \) from the first equation:
\[ D = 180 - C \]

Next, we substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[ 2C + (180 - C) = 304 \]
\[ 2C + 180 - C = 304 \]
\[ C + 180 = 304 \]
\[ C = 304 - 180 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we know \( C = 124 \), we can find \( D \):
\[ D = 180 - C \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

Final numerical answer:
56"
"First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days. He traveled 200 kilometers each day for 4 days, so the total distance for the first 4 days is:
\[ 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we need to find out how far he traveled over the next two days, which was 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. So, we calculate 30% of 800 km:
\[ 0.30 \times 800 \, \text{km} = 240 \, \text{km} \]

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is 0 km.

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, so the total distance for the second week is:
\[ 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we add up all the distances to find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip:
\[ 800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} = 3140 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ 3140 \, \text{km} \]"
"Given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4.

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.

\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to determine the elevation of the comb and then calculate the difference between that elevation and Oliver's current elevation.

1. Stanley's comb fell 4,000 feet from his starting elevation of 10,000 feet.
   - Elevation of the comb = 10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet.

2. Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet.

3. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb:
   - Climbing distance = Elevation of the comb - Oliver's current elevation
   - Climbing distance = 6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet.

Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To determine how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money given by the second bank.
2. Add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital.

The first bank gave Mr. Josue $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Now, we add the amounts from both banks to his initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has \(\boxed{17000}\) in capital."
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.

Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so the total number of cats carried away is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).

After the boats carried away the cats, the number of cats left on the rock is \(50 - 20 = 30\).

Then, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. So, the number of cats that ran after the mouse is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \).

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

12 cats were left on the rock."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into the different pricing periods.

1. **First 6 months at $8 a month:**
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 a month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96
   \]

3. **The remaining 8 months (since 2 years is 24 months, and 6 + 8 = 14 months, so 24 - 14 = 10 months, but we only need 8 more to complete 2 years) at $14 a month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$112

"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The problem states that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out the total savings Cole made. The problem states that he saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can set up the following equations:

Let \( S_{tattered} \) be the savings from the tattered jeans and \( S_{jogger} \) be the savings from the jogger jeans. We know:

\[ S_{tattered} + S_{jogger} = 6 \]
\[ S_{jogger} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
\[ S_{tattered} = 6 - 2 = 4 \]

The original price of the tattered jeans is $28, and Cole saved $4 on them, so the sale price of the tattered jeans is:

\[ 28 - 4 = 24 \]

The original price of the jogger jeans is $22, and Cole saved $2 on them, so the sale price of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 22 - 2 = 20 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:

\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles.

First, we calculate the capacity of the 4 buses:
4 buses * 60 employees per bus = 240 employees

Next, we calculate the capacity of the 6 minibusses:
6 minibusses * 30 employees per minibus = 180 employees

Then, we calculate the capacity of the 10 minivans:
10 minivans * 15 employees per minivan = 150 employees

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles to get the total capacity:
240 employees (buses) + 180 employees (minibusses) + 150 employees (minivans) = 570 employees

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"First, let's determine the number of birds attracted by each type of bird feeder. We know that each store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds, and each bird feeder Lillian builds attracts 10 more birds than a store-bought one. Therefore, each of Lillian's bird feeders attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds.

Lillian has 3 bird feeders she built and 3 store-bought bird feeders. So, the total number of birds attracted by the bird feeders she built is 3 * 30 = 90 birds. The total number of birds attracted by the store-bought bird feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

Adding these together, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is 90 + 60 = 150 birds.

150 birds"
"To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the bagel is given as $4.
2. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. So, the cost of the soup is:
   \[
   4 + (0.25 \times 4) = 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The cake costs half the price of the bagel. So, the cost of the cake is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake:
\[
5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ dollars}

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay \(\boxed{11}\) dollars for her dinner."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money Kenny has after selling his cards:**
   - Kenny has $50 in spending cash and the ticket to the amusement park costs $100.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money he has after buying the ticket is $50 + $100 = $150.

2. **Calculate the number of cards Kenny sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - To find out how many cards he sold, we divide the total amount of money by the price per card: $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards.

3. **Determine the total number of cards Kenny started with:**
   - Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells the rest.
   - If he sold 100 cards, which is 2/3 of his total cards, then 1/3 of his cards is 100 / 2 = 50 cards.
   - Therefore, the total number of cards he started with is 50 * 3 = 150 cards.

So, Kenny started with 150 cards."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation**: The caterer prepared enough hot dogs for half of the 36 guests to have two hot dogs each. So, half of 36 is 18 guests. This means 18 guests would get 2 hot dogs each, which totals 36 hot dogs for these guests.

2. **Total Hot Dogs Needed**: Since 40 guests showed up and everyone wanted a second hot dog, we need to calculate the total number of hot dogs required. Each of the 40 guests would need 2 hot dogs, so the total number of hot dogs needed is \(40 \times 2 = 80\) hot dogs.

3. **Hot Dogs Available**: The caterer initially prepared 36 hot dogs for the first 18 guests. Since 40 guests showed up, and the caterer only prepared 36 hot dogs, the number of hot dogs left for the additional 22 guests (40 - 18) is \(80 - 36 = 44\) hot dogs.

4. **Hot Dogs for Second Hot Dog**: Out of the 44 hot dogs available, 18 guests already have a second hot dog, so we need to see how many of the remaining 22 guests can get a second hot dog. Since 44 hot dogs are available and 18 guests already have a second hot dog, the remaining hot dogs are \(44 - 18 = 26\).

5. **Guests Without Second Hot Dog**: Since 22 guests are left and 26 hot dogs are available, all 22 guests can get a second hot dog. Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is \(22 - 22 = 0\).

"Indras' name has 6 letters.

Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3 letters.

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, so her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Therefore, the total number of letters in both names is 6 (Indras) + 7 (sister) = 13 letters.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Set of mixing bowls: $20.00
- 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Now, add these amounts together to get the total before the discount:

$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Next, calculate the discount. Since everything is 20% off, we need to find 20% of $165.00:

20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Now, subtract the discount from the total to find the final cost:

$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

Therefore, Charlotte's order was $132.00."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy:

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, let's calculate how much money Dora has:

- Saved from allowance: $2
- Money given by her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, to find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the total money she has from the total cost of the items:

$19 (total cost) - $18 (total money Dora has) = $1

Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

"First, we need to determine how much gasoline is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needs in gallons. Josey needs \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons by 8:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"First, let's calculate how much money George had left after his purchases. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Money left} = 5 \times \frac{1}{100} = 0.05 \]

So, the total amount spent is:

\[ 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the 3 bags of chips:

\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent to find out how much was spent on candy bars:

\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so we divide the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar to find out how many candy bars George bought:

\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine will use. He doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. Therefore, he will use:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound, so the cost for the onions will be:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is on sale for $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock will be:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to find the total cost of the ingredients:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

"Wayne's drive to the theater takes 4 minutes. Since Bernadette's drive takes four times as long, her drive takes \(4 \times 4 = 16\) minutes.

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to leave 5 minutes earlier than Wayne's departure time. However, the question asks how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne to get to the theater first, which means we need to account for her longer travel time.

If Wayne leaves at time \(T\), he will arrive at \(T + 4\) minutes. Bernadette needs to arrive at \(T + 4 - 5 = T - 1\) to be 5 minutes early for Wayne. Since her drive takes 16 minutes, she needs to leave at \(T - 1 - 16 = T - 17\).

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room in feet. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

We can rearrange this formula to solve for the width:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{Length}} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:

"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we first need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

For Elizabeth:
- Red beads: 1 pack * 20 beads/pack = 20 beads
- Clear beads: 2 packs * 20 beads/pack = 40 beads
- Total beads for Elizabeth: 20 + 40 = 60 beads

For Margareth:
- Blue beads: 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads
- Red beads: 4 packs * 20 beads/pack = 80 beads
- Total beads for Margareth: 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters:
- Margareth's beads - Elizabeth's beads = 140 - 60 = 80 beads

Therefore, one sister has 80 more beads than the other.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking**: Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour.
   - Temperature increase per hour = 5 degrees
   - Total hours baking = 3
   - Total temperature increase = 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees
   - New temperature after baking = 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

3. **Cooling**: Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   - Cooling rate = 2 degrees/10 minutes
   - Total time the window is open = 30 minutes
   - Number of 10-minute intervals in 30 minutes = 30 minutes / 10 minutes = 3 intervals
   - Total temperature decrease = 2 degrees/interval * 3 intervals = 6 degrees
   - Final temperature = 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

The house's final temperature is 49 degrees."
"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon:

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time James took for the swim is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so:

\[ 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's:

\[ 170 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we can find out how long it took James to do the run by subtracting the time he took for the swim and the bike from his total time:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} - 85 \text{ minutes} = 59 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it took James 59 minutes to do the run."
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C into minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is:

\[ 1.25 \times 60 = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so:

\[ \text{Length of Movie B} = 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, so:

\[ \text{Length of Movie A} = \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Movie A was 20 minutes long."
"First, let's determine how far the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the distance the horse runs is:
\[ 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate how much hay the horse eats. For every mile, the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse eats:
\[ 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails of hay} \]

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost for 8 bails of hay is:
\[ 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

The change Michael gets after buying the hay is:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has. She uses 4 dozen eggs and 2 additional eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal 48 eggs. Adding the 2 additional eggs, the total number of eggs is:

\[ 48 + 2 = 50 \]

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog can be made with 50 eggs, given that each glass requires 5 eggs. We divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed per glass:

\[ 50 \div 5 = 10 \]

Each glass holds 5 eggs, and since each tray holds 5 glasses, we need to find out how many trays can be filled with 10 glasses of eggnog. Since each tray holds 5 glasses, the number of trays Rozanne can put out is:

\[ 10 \div 5 = 2 \]

Therefore, Rozanne can put out 2 trays of eggnog."
"To determine by how many points Joey is now winning, we need to calculate the total points for both Joey and Marcy after their respective turns and then find the difference between their scores.

First, let's calculate Joey's total points:
- Joey starts with 214 points.
- He scores an additional 26 points.
- Therefore, Joey's total points are \(214 + 26 = 240\).

Next, let's calculate Marcy's total points:
- Marcy starts with 225 points.
- She scores an additional 10 points.
- Therefore, Marcy's total points are \(225 + 10 = 235\).

Now, we find the difference between Joey's and Marcy's total points to determine by how many points Joey is winning:
- Joey's total points: 240

"To calculate the salesman's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per sneaker.
2. Calculate the total revenue from the flash sale.
3. Calculate the total revenue from the department store.
4. Calculate the total revenue.
5. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost per sneaker.**

The total cost for the case of sneakers is $576, and there are 48 sneakers in the case. So, the cost per sneaker is:
\[ \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from the flash sale.**

The salesman sold 17 sneakers at $20 each. So, the revenue from the flash sale is:
\[ \text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from the department store.**

The salesman sold the remaining sneakers (48 - 17 = 31) at $25 each. So, the revenue from the department store is:
\[ \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total revenue.**

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the revenue from the department store:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 5: Calculate the profit.**

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ \text{Profit} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the salesman's profit is:
\[ \boxed{539} \]"
"To find the total number of crayons Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of crayons in each type of packet and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets that each contain 8 pieces:
\[ 6 \text{ packets} \times 8 \text{ crayons per packet} = 48 \text{ crayons} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of crayons in the four packets that each contain 16 pieces:
\[ 4 \text{ packets} \times 16 \text{ crayons per packet} = 64 \text{ crayons} \]

Now, we add the two totals together to find the overall number of crayons:
\[ 48 \text{ crayons} + 64 \text{ crayons} = 112 \text{ crayons} \]

Therefore, the total number of crayons Beatrice bought is:
\[ 112 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Super Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $20
   - Popcorn with soda: $1 extra
   - Total cost with super ticket: $20 + $1 = $21

2. **Regular Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $12
   - Popcorn: $x (unknown regular price)
   - Soda: $3
   - Total cost without super ticket: $12 + $x + $3 = $15 + $x

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - Therefore, the cost of the regular ticket option minus the cost of the super ticket option equals $2.
   - $15 + $x - $21 = $2
   - Simplify the equation: $x - $6 = $2
   - Solve for $x$: $x = $2 + $6 = $8

The regular price of the popcorn is $8."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the first day.
2. Calculate the new cost of filling one balloon after the price increase.
3. Calculate the total cost for filling 170 balloons at the new price.

**Step 1: Determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the first day.**

The total cost for 20 balloons was $900. Therefore, the cost per balloon on the first day is:
\[ \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the new cost of filling one balloon after the price increase.**

The cost of each balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:
\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost for filling 170 balloons at the new price.**

The total cost for 170 balloons at the new price is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 170 \times 65 = 11050 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{11050} \]"
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

1. For the first part of the trip:
   - Speed = 60 mph
   - Time = 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles

2. For the second part of the trip:
   - Speed = 30 mph
   - Time = 1 hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 1 hour = 30 miles

3. Total distance traveled = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

4. Total time taken = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

5. Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."
"Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. 

First, let's calculate the value of the sapphires she trades:
3 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $2400

After the trade, she has:
8 sapphires - 3 sapphires = 5 sapphires

The value of the remaining sapphires:
5 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $4000

She gains 2 rubies from the trade, and the value of these rubies is:
2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $2400

Now, let's add the value of the remaining sapphires and the rubies to find the total value of her jewels:
$4000 (remaining sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $6400

The total value of all her jewels is:
$6400"

"First, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed. The volume of a raised bed is given by its width, length, and height:

\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume of soil} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{\$/bag} = 1920 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, the potting soil will cost Bob $1920."
"First, let's calculate the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can find the number of green cards by calculating 60% of 15 and adding that to 15.

60% of 15 is:
\[ 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \]

So, the number of green cards is:
\[ 15 + 9 = 24 \]

Next, we calculate the number of yellow cards. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:
\[ 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Now, we add up all the cards:
\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 39 \text{ (yellow)} = 78 \]

Therefore, the total number of cards is:
\[ 78 \]"
"Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. After twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies join, which is:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

Total number of puppies = 8 (Jennifer's) + 12 (Brandon's) = 20 puppies
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 (Jennifer's) + 4 (Brandon's) = 7 puppies

Now, to find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.35 \times 100 = 35\% \]

Therefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots."
"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to make, we first need to calculate the total weight of all the feed he is buying.

For the aluminum cans:
3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week

For the plastic bottles:
5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week

Total earnings per week:
6 cents (from cans) + 15 cents (from bottles) = 21 cents/week

For a four-week month:
21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents

Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month."
"First, let's determine how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

\[ \text{Toni's plants} = \text{Frederick's plants} + 0.60 \times \text{Frederick's plants} \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 0.60 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 16 \]

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate the number of plants Shondra has as follows:

\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = \text{Toni's plants} - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 16 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 9 \]

So, the tip amount is $3.

Now, we add the tip to the cost of the pizza to find the total amount:
\[ 15 + 3 = 18 \]

Therefore, the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man is $18."
"Let's break down Finley's position changes step by step:

1. She started in first place.
2. She fell back 5 spots: \(1 - 5 = -4\). Since she can't be in a negative spot, we adjust this to the last possible position, which is 100 (assuming a 100-person race).
3. She then moved ahead 2 spots: \(100 + 2 = 102\). Again, adjusting to the last possible position, this becomes 100.
4. She fell behind 3 spots: \(100 - 3 = 97\).
5. Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot: \(97 + 1 = 98\).

So, Finley finished in 98th place."
"First, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has:

"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we need to calculate the number of each type of laundry item per room and then multiply by the number of rooms.

1. Each room has 2 sheets.
2. Each room has 1 comforter.
3. Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so each room has \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pillow cases.
4. Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so each room has \(2 \times 4 = 8\) towels.

Now, we sum up the total number of each type of laundry item per room:
- Sheets: \(2\)
- Comforters: \(1\)
- Pillow cases: \(4\)
- Towels: \(8\)

Total laundry items per room = \(2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15\)

For 80 rooms, the total number of laundry items is:

"Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes. Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, he initially has 200 / 2 = 100 pairs.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs, so he now has 100 + 5 = 105 pairs.

On Wednesday, he gains 15 more pairs, making it 105 + 15 = 120 pairs.

On Friday, he gains another 30 pairs, so he has 120 + 30 = 150 pairs.

By Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. Since he has 150 pairs, he has 150 * 2 = 300 shoes. After getting rid of 180 shoes, he has 300 - 180 = 120 shoes left.

"First, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet to match the unit of the shark's body length. There are 12 inches in a foot.

Each remora is 6 inches long, which is \( \frac{6}{12} = 0.5 \) feet long.

Since there are 2 remoras, the combined length of the remoras is \( 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \) foot.

The shark's body length is 10 feet.

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length."

"To find out how many kids in Gina's class are not allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to first determine how many kids are allergic to at least one of the substances (dairy or peanuts).

Let's denote:
- \( D \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( P \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

We are given:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

The number of kids allergic to at least one of the substances is given by:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

This means 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances. Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - |D \cup P| = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel during the busy weekend. The normal price is $1500 per day, and it is 20% more expensive during the busy weekend.

The increase in price is:
\[ 1500 \times 0.20 = 300 \]

So, the cost per day during the busy weekend is:
\[ 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, so for two people, it is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Adding the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel together gives the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the trip is:

They need to earn $26 more to reach their goal."
"Gabriel has 20 songs on his player. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, which means Luri has \(3 \times 20 = 60\) songs on his player.

The maximum capacity of each player is 100 songs. Therefore, the number of songs Gabriel can still add to his player is \(100 - 20 = 80\) songs.

Similarly, the number of songs Luri can still add to his player is \(100 - 60 = 40\) songs.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add to his player than Gabriel can add to his, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:

\(80 - 40 = 40\)

Therefore, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his."

\[ 3 \times 80 = 240 \]

Next, we subtract $20 from this amount to find the cost of the handbag:
\[ 240 - 20 = 220 \]

Therefore, the cost of Jillian's handbag is $220."
"James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week. 

First, calculate the total miles he runs in a week:
\[ 12 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 60 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, since he runs at a pace of 10 miles per hour, we can find the total hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles by his speed:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, James runs a total of 6 hours a week."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the daily consumption of oats for one horse:**
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, the daily consumption for one horse is \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).

2. **Determine the daily consumption of oats for all four horses:**
   - Since there are four horses, the total daily consumption is \(10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).

3. **Determine the total consumption of oats for five days:**
   - The total consumption for five days is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).

4. **Determine the number of bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.
   - The number of bags needed is \(\frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags}\).

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days."
"First, we calculate the number of Pomeranians Jana has. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can find this number by calculating two thirds of 27:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 27 = 18
\]

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians.

Next, we need to find out how many of these Pomeranians are girls. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, so we calculate one third of 18:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
\]

Therefore, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

"To find the average highest temperature of these three countries, we first need to sum the highest temperatures and then divide by the number of countries.

The highest temperatures are:
- Southlandia: -48°F
- Northlandia: 21°F
- Midlandia: -3°F

Sum of the highest temperatures:
-48 + 21 + (-3) = -30°F

Now, we divide the sum by the number of countries, which is 3:
-30 / 3 = -10°F

The average highest temperature of these three countries is -10°F."
"To find out how many days it will take the child to save the remaining amount of money, we first need to calculate the remaining amount he needs to save.

The toy car costs $12, and the child already has $4 saved. So, the remaining amount he needs to save is:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

The child promises to save $2 daily from his allowance. To find out how many days it will take to save the remaining $8, we divide the remaining amount by the daily savings:

\[ 8 \div 2 = 4 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each tray can hold 24 eggs.
2. Jaime has 2 trays, so the total capacity of the trays is \(24 \times 2 = 48\) eggs.
3. Jaime has 64 eggs in total.

Now, we need to find out how many eggs won't be able to be placed on the tray. We do this by subtracting the total capacity of the trays from the total number of eggs:

\[64 - 48 = 16\]

So, the number of eggs that won't be able to be placed on the tray is 16."
"To find out how much Sally spends in all, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza and then add it to the cost of the small pizza.

1. The cost of the small pizza is $8.
2. The family-size pizza costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, so:
   \[ \text{Cost of family-size pizza} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 + 24 = 32 \]

Sally spends a total of $32."
"To find the cost per razor after the discount, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of 2 packs of razors before any discounts:**
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - She is buying 2 packs.
   - Total cost before discounts = $4.00 * 2 = $8.00.

2. **Apply the ""buy one get one free"" sale:**
   - Since the offer is ""buy one get one free,"" she only pays for one pack and gets the second one free.
   - Cost after the sale = $4.00 (for the first pack).

3. **Apply the $2.00 coupon:**
   - Subtract the coupon from the sale price.
   - Cost after the coupon = $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

4. **Calculate the cost per razor:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - Total number of razors = 4 * 2 = 8 razors.
   - Cost per razor = $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

5. **Convert the cost per razor to cents:**
   - $0.25 = 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor after all discounts is 25 cents."
"To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to identify the height of the shortest cheerleader, as she will be at the top of the pyramid. According to the problem, 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, and the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall. Therefore, the shortest cheerleader is 60 inches tall.

The height of the human pyramid is simply the height of the shortest cheerleader, which is 60 inches.

To convert this height into feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

\[ \frac{60 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the human pyramid is 5 feet."
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour. Since she works 8 hours a day, she walks 5 minutes x 8 = 40 minutes each day. Over 5 days, she walks 40 minutes/day x 5 days = 200 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be \(14 + 4 = 18\) years old.
3. At that time, Angela will be three times Brett's current age. Brett's current age is 14, so three times that is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

This means that in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. To find out how old Angela is right now, we subtract 4 years from 42:

\[42 - 4 = 38\]

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

**Angela is 38 years old.**"
"Paul drives his car twice a day for 14 days. 

For the morning rides, he spends $6 each day, so for 14 days, he spends:
\[ 6 \times 14 = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

For the afternoon rides, he spends $2 each day, so for 14 days, he spends:
\[ 2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the costs of the morning and afternoon rides together, the total amount spent is:
\[ 84 + 28 = 112 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Paul spent a total of $112 on driving his car during these two weeks."
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, let's find the total number of oranges both brought together:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges, we can calculate the number of pies they can make by dividing the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, they can make 40 Greek orange pies."
"To find the number of guests at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests by \( x \).

For the first venue, the total cost is the flat fee plus the cost of food:
\[ \text{Cost}_1 = 200 + 5x \]

For the second venue, the total cost is the cost per person for the venue plus the cost of food, but since the food is already included, the cost is just the cost per person for the venue:
\[ \text{Cost}_2 = 25x \]

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( \boxed{10} \)."
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \(D\), by Lily as \(L\), and by Bodhi as \(B\).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \(L + D + B = 43\)
2. \(L = D + 7\)
3. \(D = \frac{1}{2}B\)

First, we can express \(B\) in terms of \(D\) using the third equation:
\[B = 2D\]

Now, we can substitute \(L\) and \(B\) in terms of \(D\) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]
\[ 4D = 36 \]
\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know \(D = 9\), we can find \(L\) and \(B\):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Lily found \(16\) insects.

Lily found 16 insects."
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the amount each of them used and then add those amounts together.

First, let's calculate the amount of yarn Mariah used:
Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, Mariah used:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the amount of yarn Mariah's grandma used:
Her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein of yarn. So, she used:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we add the amounts used by Mariah and her grandma to find the total amount of yarn used:
\[ 91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, they used 273 yards of yarn altogether."

"Given that the chair is 3 feet wide, we can determine the width of the rug and then use that to find the length of the couch.

1. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair.
   - Width of the rug = Width of the chair + 5 feet
   - Width of the rug = 3 feet + 5 feet = 8 feet

2. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug.
   - Length of the couch = 2 * Width of the rug + 2 feet
   - Length of the couch = 2 * 8 feet + 2 feet = 16 feet + 2 feet = 18 feet

Therefore, the couch is 18 feet long."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. Two of these packs are strawberry.
3. One pack is grape, which costs $2.
4. One pack is green apple, which costs half as much as the grape pack, so it costs $1.
5. The total cost of all the packs is $7.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

The total cost equation can be written as:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

Each pack of strawberry gum costs $2."
"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, he should buy the cheapest lumber, which is the 2 x 4 piece of wood. Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks, and it costs $4.

Given Frederick has $24 to spend, he can buy:
\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]
pieces of 2 x 4 wood.

Since each piece of 2 x 4 wood provides 200 sticks, the total number of sticks he can make is:

"To determine the cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the price per pair of snowshoes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
- Each dog has 4 legs.
- Mario has 6 dogs.
- Total number of legs = 6 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 24 legs.

Step 2: Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
- Each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs.
- Number of pairs of snowshoes = 24 legs / 2 legs/pair = 12 pairs.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the price per pair of snowshoes.
- Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
- Total cost = 12 pairs * $12.00/pair = $144.00.

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $144.00."
"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass and then compare it to the cost of the pass.

First, let's calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass:
- Janet takes 2 bus trips each day.
- She takes these trips 5 days a week.
- Each bus trip costs $2.20.

The total cost of her bus trips without the pass is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} \times \$2.20 \text{ per trip} = 10 \times \$2.20 = \$22.00 \]

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the weekly bus pass:
- The weekly bus pass costs $20.

The amount Janet would save by buying the weekly bus pass is:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Janet would save \(\$2.00\) by buying a weekly bus pass."
"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. According to the problem:

1. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
2. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.

From point 1, if the farm has 30 cows, then the zoo should have half as many cows, which is not directly relevant to the number of sheep and cows we are given.

From point 2, if the zoo has 20 sheep, then the farm should have half as many sheep, which is 10 sheep.

Now, let's sum up the total number of animals:

- The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 20 sheep + (the number of cows, which is not specified but not needed for the total animal count) = 20 sheep (since the number of cows in the zoo is not given and not needed for the final count).

So, the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo combined is:

40 (from the farm) + 20 (from the zoo) = 60 animals.

"Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought, we can determine the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought by dividing the quantities Rose bought by 4.

For onions:
\[ \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

For potatoes:
\[ \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes at the market."
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 pounds.
2. Determine the number of days Andy has to achieve this goal.
3. Calculate the daily calorie deficit required.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of calories to be burned.**

Andy wants to lose 30 pounds, and it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 pound. Therefore, the total number of calories to be burned is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Andy has to achieve this goal.**

Today is December 31st, and Andy's birthday is July 19th. The number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July (up to July 19th): 19 days

Adding these up:
\[ 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190 \text{ days} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the daily calorie deficit required.**

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total number of calories to be burned by the number of days:
\[ \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{190 \text{ days}} \approx 552.63 \text{ calories/day} \]

Therefore, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 553 calories to reach his goal."

To find out how much he earned in total, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days he worked:
\[ 30 \times 7 = 210 \]

Gerald spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:
\[ 210 - 100 = 110 \]

Therefore, Gerald has $110 left."
"First, we need to calculate the total distance Hannah will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she runs 8 laps, we can find the total distance by multiplying the number of laps by the distance per lap:

\[ 8 \text{ laps} \times 0.25 \text{ km/lap} = 2 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to determine how much water Hannah needs to drink for the total distance. Since she needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs, we multiply the total distance by the amount of water per kilometer:

\[ 2 \text{ km} \times 60 \text{ ml/km} = 120 \text{ ml} \]

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water."
"Julie initially had $500.

First, she spent 20% of $500 on clothes:
\[ 20\% \times 500 = 0.20 \times 500 = 100 \]

So, after buying clothes, she had:
\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs:
\[ 25\% \times 400 = 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]

So, after buying CDs, she had:
\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

Therefore, Julie had $300 left."
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house:
\[ H = 3L \]
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost is $90,000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags that Tara bought. She bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, at $4 per pack. So, the total number of canvas bags is:

\[ 8 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ bags/pack} = 40 \text{ bags} \]

The total cost for these bags is:

\[ 8 \text{ packs} \times \$4/\text{pack} = \$32 \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the bags. She sold each bag for $8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 40 \text{ bags} \times \$8/\text{bag} = \$320 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$320 - \$32 = \$288 \]

Therefore, the profit Tara earned on her bags is:

\[ \$288 \]"

\[ \text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially.

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. So, the total amount from the $10 bills is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount from the $20 bills is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Ali has:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total to his sister. So, the amount given to his sister is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

The remaining amount after giving half to his sister is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount of money he has after buying dinner is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Tony's Picking Rate:**
   - Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

2. **Bobby's Picking Rate:**
   - Bobby picks one less quart than Tony.
   - Therefore, Bobby's rate is \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.

3. **Kathy's Picking Rate:**
   - Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby.
   - Therefore, Kathy's rate is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) quarts per hour.

4. **Ricky's Picking Rate:**
   - Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy.
   - Therefore, Ricky's rate is \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, we sum up the picking rates of all four individuals to find the total number of quarts they can pick per hour:

- Tony: 6 quarts per hour
- Bobby: 5 quarts per hour
- Kathy: 10 quarts per hour
- Ricky: 8 quarts per hour

Total picking rate = \(6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29\) quarts per hour.

**Final Answer:**
29 quarts per hour."

200 (total baked) - 93 (morning sales) - 39 (afternoon sales) + 6 (returned) = 74

So, the bakers had 74 loaves of bread left."
"To determine the number of rows Jackson will plant, we need to calculate the number of rows for the red tulips and the blue tulips separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of rows for the red tulips:
- Jackson has 36 red tulips.
- He can fit 6 red tulips in a row.
- Therefore, the number of rows for the red tulips is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) rows.

Next, let's calculate the number of rows for the blue tulips:
- Jackson has 24 blue tulips.
- He can fit 8 blue tulips in a row.
- Therefore, the number of rows for the blue tulips is \( \frac{24}{8} = 3 \) rows.

Now, we add the number of rows for the red tulips and the blue tulips:
- Total number of rows = 6 (red) + 3 (blue) = 9 rows.

So, the final numerical answer is:
9 rows."
"To determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Divide the total amount of raisins equally among the three uses (oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix):**
   \[
   \text{Raisins per use} = \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups per use}
   \]

2. **Calculate how many batches of oatmeal cookies can be made with 9 cups of raisins:**
   \[
   \text{Batches of oatmeal cookies} = \frac{9 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cup per batch}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \text{ batches}
   \]

Therefore, Heather can make \(\boxed{12}\) batches of oatmeal cookies."
"First, let's calculate Ada's current weekly electric consumption and cost.

Ada's current daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. There are 24 hours in a day, so her daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh) is:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} = 288 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

To find her weekly consumption, we multiply by 7 days:
\[ 288 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 2016 \, \text{kWh/week} \]

At a rate of $1.50 per kWh, her weekly bill is:
\[ 2016 \, \text{kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$3024 \]

Next, let's calculate her new weekly consumption after adding the device.

The new device consumes 2 kWh per hour. So, her total daily consumption will be:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/hour} + 2 \, \text{kWh/hour} = 14 \, \text{kWh/hour} \]

Her new daily consumption in kWh is:
\[ 14 \, \text{kWh/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} = 336 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

Her new weekly consumption is:
\[ 336 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 2352 \, \text{kWh/week} \]

At the same rate of $1.50 per kWh, her new weekly bill is:
\[ 2352 \, \text{kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$3528 \]

Finally, the difference between her weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device is:
\[ \$3528 - \$3024 = \$504 \]

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is:
\[ \$504 \]"
"First, let's determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house (since 10 days is double the time to paint half a house).

Now, if one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, we can calculate the rate of painting per person per day. The rate is:

\[ \text{Rate per person per day} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day} \]

If 5 people are working together, their combined rate per day would be:

\[ \text{Combined rate for 5 people} = 5 \times \frac{1}{10} = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ house per day} \]

This means that 5 people can paint half a house in one day. Therefore, to paint a whole house, it would take them:

\[ \text{Time to paint a whole house} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{\frac{1}{2} \text{ house per day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total number of hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house is:

\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"Given that Ophelia has 20 sofas, and she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can calculate the number of chairs Ophelia has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = \text{Number of sofas Ophelia has} + 2 = 20 + 2 = 22 \]

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so:

\[ \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 3 \times \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = 3 \times 22 = 66 \]

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the number of sofas Jenna has is:

\[ \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} = \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:

\[ \text{Total number of sofas} = \text{Number of sofas Ophelia has} + \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} = 20 + 64 = 84 \]
\[ \text{Total number of chairs} = \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} + \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 22 + 66 = 88 \]

Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs they have is:

\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = \text{Total number of sofas} + \text{Total number of chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he didn't buy the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of the headphone set.
2. Calculate how much money Tom would have left if he didn't buy the headphone set.
3. Calculate how many CDs he could buy with the remaining money.

First, we know that Tom paid $48 in total and that one CD costs $4. Let's denote the cost of the headphone set as \( H \).

The total cost equation is:
\[ 4 + H = 48 \]

Solving for \( H \):
\[ H = 48 - 4 \]
\[ H = 44 \]

So, the headphone set costs $44.

Next, if Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have had:
\[ 48 - 44 = 4 \]

This remaining $4 is exactly the cost of one CD. Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 1 more CD.

Final numerical answer:

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours.

1. For 6 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week. So, the total for these weeks is \(6 \times 4 = 24\) hours.
2. For 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week. So, the total for these weeks is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
3. For 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours. So, the total for this week is \(1 \times 6 = 6\) hours.

Adding these together, the total number of hours he spent working out is \(24 + 10 + 6 = 40\) hours.

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40 hours."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
5. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

The final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is:
\[
\boxed{66}

"First, let's determine Jame's current age. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, then his current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\).

Next, we need to find out how old Jame will be in 8 years. In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\).

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, we calculate twice Jame's age in 8 years and then subtract 5:

\[2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55\]

This means that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 55 years old. To find out Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55:

\[55 - 8 = 47\]

Now, we need to find the current age difference between Jame and his cousin. Jame is currently 22 years old, and his cousin is currently 47 years old. The age difference is:

\[47 - 22 = 25\]

So, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Given that the computer cost $1,100 and Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can determine the cost of the printer as follows:

Cost of the printer = Cost of the computer - $400
Cost of the printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of the printer = $700

Now, let's denote the cost of one monitor as \( M \). Since Errol bought 2 monitors, the total cost for the monitors is \( 2M \).

The total cost for the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We can set up the following equation:

Cost of the computer + Cost of the 2 monitors + Cost of the printer = Total cost
$1,100 + 2M + $700 = $2,400

Now, we can solve for \( M \):

$1,100 + 2M + $700 = $2,400
$1,800 + 2M = $2,400
2M = $2,400 - $1,800
2M = $600
M = $600 / 2
M = $300

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300.

The cost of one monitor is $300."
"The boys brought back 60 seashells each. According to the problem, the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. 

So, the number of seashells each girl brought is:

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old."
"The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 mm = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add up the thicknesses of all four books:
31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma should make to complete her monthly goal, we first need to calculate how many vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

Adding these up: \(18 + 21 + 15 = 54\) vlogs.

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs per month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:

\(72 - 54 = 18\)

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total bill including the tip:**
   - The base bill is $50.
   - The tip is 20% of $50.
   - 20% of $50 is \( 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \).

2. **Add the tip to the base bill:**
   - Total bill = Base bill + Tip
   - Total bill = $50 + $10 = $60.

3. **Split the total bill evenly:**
   - Since the bill is to be split evenly between two people, each person pays half of the total bill.
   - Each person pays \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \).

So, you end up paying $30."
"First, let's determine how much each boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, each boy gets:

\[ \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The eldest boy then added $5 to his share, making it:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

The following day, he added another $10, so his total became:

\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

He then spent $8, so his new total was:

\[ 21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

After saving some more, he tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8. Let's denote the amount he saved as \( x \). Therefore, his new total is:

\[ 13 + x \]

After tripling this amount, he had:

\[ 3 \times (13 + x) \]

Since the problem does not specify how much he saved, we assume he saved nothing more, meaning \( x = 0 \). Thus, the amount he has now is:

\[ 3 \times 13 = 39 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{39} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to break down the month of April into two halves and determine the daily savings for each half.

1. April has 30 days, so the first half (15 days) and the second half (15 days) are equal.
2. Let's denote the daily savings in the first half as \( x \).
3. According to the problem, in the second half, Elvis saves twice as much daily as in the first half, so the daily savings in the second half will be \( 2x \).

The total savings for the month can be expressed as:
\[ 15x + 15(2x) = 1125 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \]
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of April. For the second half, he saves twice as much, which is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month."

"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Writing the alphabet in full twice:**
   - The alphabet has 26 letters.
   - Writing it in full twice means \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. **Writing half of the alphabet once:**
   - Half of the alphabet is \(26 / 2 = 13\) letters.
   - Writing half of the alphabet once means \(13\) letters.

3. **Re-writing everything she has already written:**
   - So far, Elise has written \(52 + 13 = 65\) letters.
   - Re-writing everything means writing these 65 letters again.

4. **Total number of letters written:**
   - The total is the sum of the letters written in the first two steps and the re-written letters.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Five notebooks at $1.50 each: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)
- Two pens at $0.25 each: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
- One calculator at $12 each: \(1 \times 12 = 12.00\)
- One geometry set at $10 each: \(1 \times 10 = 10.00\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00\]

Now, applying a 10% discount to the total cost:
\[30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00\]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost:
\[30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00\]

Therefore, Daniel has to spend $27.00 on all the items he wants to buy."

"When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does in cold water. So, we first calculate twice the time it takes him in cold water:

\[ 2 \times 16 \text{ minutes} = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Then, we add 2 minutes to this time:

\[ 32 \text{ minutes} + 2 \text{ minutes} = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

This is the time it takes Ray to swim one mile in warm water. To find out how long it takes him to swim 3 miles in warm water, we multiply this time by 3:

\[ 34 \text{ minutes} \times 3 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in cold water. Since it takes him 16 minutes to swim one mile, for 3 miles, the time is:

\[ 16 \text{ minutes} \times 3 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day, we subtract the time it takes in cold water from the time it takes in warm water:

\[ 102 \text{ minutes} - 48 \text{ minutes} = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."

Next, we need to find out how many buttons have 4 holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have 2 holes, the remaining buttons are:
\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \]
These 14 buttons each have 4 holes, so the total number of holes from these buttons is:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

Now, we add the holes from both groups of buttons:
\[ 14 + 56 = 70 \]

Therefore, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to follow the given relationships step by step.

1. Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches.
2. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, so:
   \[
   \text{Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

Therefore, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches."
"First, let's determine how many cups of coffee Octavia drinks daily. Since the daily recommended amount is 8 cups (as Juan drinks 10 times what Octavia drinks and his recommended amount is 4 cups), Octavia drinks half of that, which is 4 cups.

Juan currently drinks 10 times what Octavia drinks, so he drinks \(10 \times 4 = 40\) cups of coffee daily.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. Therefore, Juan needs to reduce his daily coffee intake by \(40 - 4 = 36\) cups.

By how many cups must Juan reduce his daily coffee intake?

"The pet shop has 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, so that's 3 * 10 = 30 hamsters.

The pet shop also has 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 guinea pigs.

Adding the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together gives us the total number of rodents:

30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents.

The pet shop has a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's determine the weight of each person:

1. Mark weighs 150 pounds.
2. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan's weight is \(150 - 20 = 130\) pounds.
3. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob's weight is \(2 \times 130 = 260\) pounds.

Now, to find the average weight of the three friends, we add their weights together and divide by 3:

\[
\text{Average weight} = \frac{\text{Mark's weight} + \text{Susan's weight} + \text{Bob's weight}}{3} = \frac{150 + 130 + 260}{3} = \frac{540}{3} = 180
\]

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the movement of the sun relative to the pyramid and how this affects the angle from the ground to the sun.

1. The initial angle of the pyramid from the ground is 32 degrees.
2. The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which means the initial angle from the ground to the sun is also 32 degrees.
3. The sun moves 5 degrees per hour straight upward.
4. The sun moves for 10 hours.

The total movement of the sun upward in 10 hours is:
\[ 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \]

Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid (32 degrees from the ground), and it moves 50 degrees upward, the new angle from the ground to the sun will be:
\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

Therefore, the final angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is:
\[ \boxed{82} \]"
"First, let's determine the ages of James's sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, so the second son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of candles required. Since each son needs a candle for each year of their age, we add the ages of both sons: 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Now, we need to find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Each pack contains 5 candles, so we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: 20 / 5 = 4 packs.

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pack costs $3, so we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 4 * $3 = $12.

James spends $12 on candles."
"First, let's calculate how many minutes Judy read in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night and there are 7 nights in a week, we can calculate the total reading time for the first week as follows:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pages she read in the first week. Given that she reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she reads per minute:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages she read in the first week:

\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week:

\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

Therefore, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

\[ 240 \]"
"Cody ate a third of the 12 sandwiches, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) sandwiches.

Trevor ate a quarter of the 12 sandwiches, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \) sandwiches.

Together, they ate \( 4 + 3 = 7 \) sandwiches.

Therefore, the number of sandwiches left is \( 12 - 7 = 5 \).

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

From the problem, we know:
- Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so \( S = 44 \).
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be \( S + 7 \) years old.
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew, so \( S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \).

Substituting \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Dividing both sides by 3:
\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Subtracting 7 from both sides:
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

Final numerical answer:
10"
"Let's break down the payments step by step:

1. For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 per tooth. So, for three teeth, that's $1.00 × 3 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. So, for two teeth, that's $0.50 × 2 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all the amounts:

$5.00 (first tooth) + $3.00 (next three teeth) + $1.00 (last two teeth) = $9.00

The tooth fairy left Sharon a total of $9.00."
"Given that Richie scored 80 goals, and he scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can determine the number of goals Mark scored as follows:

\[ \text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Next, since Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, we can determine the number of goals Anna scored as follows:

\[ \text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:

\[ \text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} \]
\[ \text{Total goals} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

Therefore, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is 175."
"To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made compared to Liam, we first need to calculate how much money each of them made.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each. So, the total amount of money Mitchell made is:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Liam made $63.

Now, to find out how much more money Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:
\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Mitchell made 21 more dollars than Liam that weekend."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into a few steps:

1. Calculate how much Peter spends each day from Sunday through Wednesday.
2. Determine how much money Peter has left after Wednesday.
3. Calculate how many plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining money from Thursday through Sunday.
4. Sum the total number of action figures he buys.

First, let's find out how much Peter spends each day from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spends an equal amount each day and he has $70 for the week, we divide $70 by 7 days:

\[ \frac{70}{7} = 10 \]

So, Peter spends $10 each day. From Sunday through Wednesday, he spends:

\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

This means he has:

\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

left after Wednesday.

Next, we need to find out how many plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining $40. Each plastic action figure costs $2, so he can buy:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

plastic action figures from Thursday through Sunday.

Now, we need to calculate the total number of action figures he buys. He bought 3 wooden action figures each day for 3 days, so:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

wooden action figures. Adding the 20 plastic action figures, the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is:

\[ 9 + 20 = 29 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees.

First, let's calculate the percentage error in the temperature setting:

The actual temperature is 468 degrees, and the intended temperature is 450 degrees. The difference is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage error is then:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means Maggie's oven is 4% too hot. To find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to determine what temperature would result in 520 degrees when the oven is 4% too hot.

Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set her oven to. Since the oven is 4% too hot, the actual temperature will be 104% of the setting temperature. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]
\[ x = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees."
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, the first movie is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours into minutes gives:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]
Adding the 5 minutes gives:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 125 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the durations of the two movies together:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 125 \text{ minutes} = 215 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies."

2. Subtract that amount from Herb's house price to find the value of Juan's house:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

3. Now, add the value of both houses together:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy brought. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

The total number of cups brought by both Judy and her friend is \(12 + 40 = 52\).

The total number of dishes brought by both is \(24 + 44 = 68\).

Therefore, the total number of utensils (cups + dishes) brought by the two is \(52 + 68 = 120\).

"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount. 

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 single use contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per contact when buying 2 boxes is:

"First, let's calculate the total calories Hannah burns from aerobics and running.

- Aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
- Running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Now, we know that Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. To find out how much water she needs to drink for 1600 calories, we can set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{100 \, \text{ml}}{200 \, \text{calories}} = \frac{x \, \text{ml}}{1600 \, \text{calories}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{100 \, \text{ml} \times 1600 \, \text{calories}}{200 \, \text{calories}} \]

\[ x = \frac{160000 \, \text{ml} \cdot \text{calories}}{200 \, \text{calories}} \]

\[ x = 800 \, \text{ml} \]

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the note on the jar, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans.

So, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) can be expressed as:
\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]

And the number of green jelly beans \( G \) can be expressed as:
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we have:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."

"The Affenpinscher weighed 10 pounds.

The Dachshund weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so:
\[ \text{Dachshund's weight} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ pounds} \]

The Papillon weighed one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so:
\[ \text{Papillon's weight} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

The Mastiff weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so:
\[ \text{Mastiff's weight} = 44 \times 5 = 220 \text{ pounds} \]

The Mastiff weighed 220 pounds."
"To determine how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we need to calculate the total cost for each platform and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Amazon:
- The cost of the boots on Amazon is $16.
- The shipping cost on Amazon is $4.
- Therefore, the total cost on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for eBay:
- The cost of the boots on eBay is $13.
- The shipping cost on eBay is twice the cost of the shipping on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8.
- Therefore, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, we find the difference in the total cost between eBay and Amazon:
- The total cost on eBay is $21.
- The total cost on Amazon is $20.
- The difference is $21 - $20 = $1.

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to grow taller than 20 feet, given that it doubles its height every day and starts at 4 feet tall.

Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk day by day:

- Day 0: 4 feet
- Day 1: 4 feet * 2 = 8 feet
- Day 2: 8 feet * 2 = 16 feet
- Day 3: 16 feet * 2 = 32 feet

On Day 3, the beanstalk reaches 32 feet, which is taller than the 20 feet required to be taller than Mark's window.

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the weekly protein intake based on daily consumption.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, 200 grams (which is double the amount) would contain double the protein:

\[ 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} \times \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

So, John gets 6 grams of protein from 200 grams of mushrooms each day.

Next, to find out how much protein he gets in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ 6 \text{ grams of protein/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein/week} \]

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms daily."
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
Subtract \( 2J \) from both sides:
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
Multiply both sides by -1:
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

1. The base price for 2 implants is $2000 each, so for 2 implants, the cost is:
   \[2 \times 2000 = 4000\]

2. For one of the implants, there is an additional cost for a porcelain crown, which is $500. So, the total cost for the dental work is:
   \[4000 + 500 = 4500\]

3. George has already put down a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
   \[4500 - 600 = 3900\]

4. George makes $15 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
   \[3900 \div 15 = 260\]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:

\[ x = 30 \]

Now, we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Colby has in each type of coin:

- Quarters: 8 quarters × $0.25 = $2.00
- Dimes: 6 dimes × $0.10 = $0.60
- Nickels: 14 nickels × $0.05 = $0.70
- Pennies: 15 pennies × $0.01 = $0.15

Now, let's add up all the money Colby has:

$2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45

Since each gumball costs a nickel ($0.05), we can find out how many gumballs Colby can buy by dividing the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:

$3.45 ÷ $0.05 = 69

Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"To find the total number of legs the pets in the store have, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

- Dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- Cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- Birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:

\(20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}\)

Therefore, the total number of legs the pets in the store have is 48."
"Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He increases the weight by 50%, so the new weight is:

\[ 8 \text{ pounds} + (0.50 \times 8 \text{ pounds}) = 8 \text{ pounds} + 4 \text{ pounds} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, he uses a weight that is two pounds lighter than 12 pounds:

\[ 12 \text{ pounds} - 2 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the weight that he now uses is 10 pounds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Games**: Steve gets 5 games for his birthday.
2. **First Year**: He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so he buys \(1 \times 12 = 12\) games.
3. **Second Year**: He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so he buys \(2 \times 12 = 24\) games.
4. **Third Year**: He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, so he buys \(4 \times 12 = 48\) games.
5. **Christmas Gifts**: He gets 5 games every Christmas for 3 years, so he gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) games.

Now, let's add all these together:

- Initial games: 5
- First year: 12
- Second year: 24
- Third year: 48
- Christmas gifts: 15

Total number of games = \(5 + 12 + 24 + 48 + 15 = 104\)

So, after 3 years, Steve has 104 games."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The speed is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken.

Given:
- Distance traveled = 1200 miles
- Time taken = 3 hours

Speed of the plane = Distance / Time = 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per hour.

Now, we need to find out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same speed.

Time = Distance / Speed = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour = 5 hours.

Therefore, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate.

5 hours"
"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolate Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds of chocolate Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds as Ruiz in an hour:

\[ 60 \times \frac{3}{4} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we find out how many pounds of chocolate Ruiz and Marissa can make together in one hour:

\[ 60 + 45 = 105 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Since they worked for 12 hours in a day, we multiply the total amount they can make in one hour by 12:

\[ 105 \times 12 = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

\[ 1260 \text{ pounds} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Howard spends each day and then subtract the total from his original amount of $100.

2. On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
3. On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he spent on Tuesday, which is \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, let's add up the total amount spent over the three days:
\[8 + 16 + 64 = 88\]

Howard originally had $100. After spending $88, the amount of money he has left is:
\[100 - 88 = 12\]

Therefore, Howard has \(\boxed{12}\) dollars left."
"To calculate the total money Patrick earned, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the earnings from the first four hours and the earnings from the next two hours.

1. For the first four hours:
   - He sold 15 cups per hour.
   - The price per cup was $0.50.
   - Therefore, the earnings for the first four hours are \(15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} \times \$0.50 \text{ per cup} = 60 \times 0.50 = \$30\).

2. For the next two hours:
   - He sold 10 cups per hour.
   - The price per cup was $0.60.
   - Therefore, the earnings for the next two hours are \(10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} \times \$0.60 \text{ per cup} = 20 \times 0.60 = \$12\).

Adding the earnings from both parts together:
- Total earnings = \$30 + \$12 = \$42.

Patrick earned a total of \$42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations per tire for Jeremy's monthly driving.
2. Determine the total number of rotations per tire over a year.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations per tire for Jeremy's monthly driving.**

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
\[ \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/rotation cycle}} \times 725 \text{ rotations/cycle} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of rotations per tire over a year.**

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of rotations per tire in a year is:
\[ 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.**

To find out how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations, we divide the total number of rotations by the number of rotations per year:
\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the tire will need to be replaced in \(\boxed{6}\) years."
"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of washings per pump.
2. Determine the cost per washing.
3. Calculate the cost per pump.

First, we know that 2 pumps of shampoo give 120 washings. Therefore, 1 pump would give half of that number of washings:
\[ \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per washing. The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, which is equivalent to 2400 cents (since 1 dollar = 100 cents):
\[ \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{2400 \text{ cents}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 20 \text{ cents per washing} \]

Now, we can find the cost per pump by multiplying the cost per washing by the number of washings per pump:
\[ \text{Cost per pump} = 60 \text{ washings per pump} \times 20 \text{ cents per washing} = 1200 \text{ cents} \]

However, since we are looking for the cost per pump, we need to divide the total cost of the shampoo by the number of pumps:
\[ \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{2400 \text{ cents}}{2} = 1200 \text{ cents} \div 60 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

So, the cost per pump is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the discount on the items Joe wants to buy. The shirt originally costs $25 and there is a 30% discount on it. The discount amount for the shirt is:

\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

So, the discounted price of the shirt is:

\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

Next, the shorts cost $35 and there is no discount mentioned for them, so the price of the shorts remains $35.

Now, let's add the discounted price of the shirt and the price of the shorts to find the total cost of the items:

\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

However, Joe only has $50 to spend. Since the total cost of the items ($52.50) is more than the amount Joe has, he cannot afford to buy both items. Therefore, the question as stated does not have a feasible solution under the given constraints. 

But if we were to assume the question meant to ask how much money Joe would have left if he could only buy one item, we would calculate as follows:

If Joe buys the shirt:
\[ 50 - 17.50 = 32.50 \]

If Joe buys the shorts:
\[ 50 - 35 = 15 \]

Since Joe cannot afford both, the maximum amount of money Joe can have left is $32.50 if he buys the shirt.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{32.50} \]"
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the amount of butter needed for the total number of dozens of croissants.

First, Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days. So, the total number of dozens of croissants he will make in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we know that it takes \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, for 28 dozen croissants, the amount of butter needed is:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make these croissants."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we first need to calculate the cost of repaving each street.

1. Calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:

2. Calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:
   - Cost per meter = $194
   - Length of Lewis' street = 490 meters
   - Total cost for Lewis' street = $194 * 490 = $95,060

3. Find the difference in cost between Lewis' street and Monica's street:
   - Difference in cost = Cost of Lewis' street - Cost of Monica's street
   - Difference in cost = $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining months.

1. **Cost for the first 5 months:**
   - Initial funding: $100,000

2. **Cost for the remaining months:**
   - The research took 10 times the initial 5 months, so the total duration of the research is \(5 \times 10 = 50\) months.
   - Therefore, the remaining months are \(50 - 5 = 45\) months.
   - Each of these 45 months costs 50% more than the initial month's cost.
   - The cost per month for the remaining months is \(100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000\).

Now, we calculate the total cost for the remaining 45 months:
\[ 45 \times 150,000 = 6,750,000 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the first 5 months to the cost of the remaining 45 months to get the total cost:
\[ 100,000 + 6,750,000 = 6,850,000 \]

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is:
\[ \boxed{6,850,000} \]"
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to add up the ounces of meat each player ate.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that's 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, this is 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these together:

6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to follow these steps:

"To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of meat in the bull.
2. Determine how much meat Prince sells in one day.
3. Calculate the number of days required to sell all the meat.

First, the total amount of meat in the bull is 750kg.

Next, Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day. Therefore, the amount of meat he sells in one day is:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Now, to find out how many days it will take Prince to sell 750kg of meat, we divide the total amount of meat by the amount he sells per day:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

4 + 4 = 8

Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now."
"To find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we first need to calculate the total amount each coach spent.

For the baseball coach:
- Number of baseballs bought: 9
- Cost per baseball: $3
- Total cost for baseballs: 9 * $3 = $27

For the basketball coach:
- Number of basketballs bought: 8
- Cost per basketball: $14
- Total cost for basketballs: 8 * $14 = $112

Now, to find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we subtract the total cost of the baseballs from the total cost of the basketballs:
- Difference in cost: $112 - $27 = $85

The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To find out how many flowers have bloomed, we first need to calculate the total number of flowers planted in Arianna's garden. 

Arianna's garden has 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row. So, the total number of flowers is:
\[ 10 \text{ rows} \times 20 \text{ flowers/row} = 200 \text{ flowers} \]

Now, we know that only \( \frac{4}{5} \) of the planted flowers have bloomed. To find the number of bloomed flowers, we multiply the total number of flowers by \( \frac{4}{5} \):
\[ 200 \times \frac{4}{5} = 160 \]

So, the number of flowers that have bloomed in Arianna's garden is:
\[ 160 \]"
"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb/s to Mb/s.
2. Convert the speed from Mb/s to Mb/h.

Step 1: Convert kb/s to Mb/s
Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we divide the speed in kb/s by 1000 to get the speed in Mb/s.
\[ \text{Speed in Mb/s} = \frac{20 \text{ kb/s}}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \]

Step 2: Convert Mb/s to Mb/h
There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply the speed in Mb/s by 3600 to get the speed in Mb/h.
\[ \text{Speed in Mb/h} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s/h} = 72 \text{ Mb/h} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"To calculate the total number of cars towed in that week, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum them up.

1. For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. So, the total for these three days is:
   \[
   10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
   \]

2. For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars than it did on the first three days. So, it pulled:
   \[
   10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars/day}
   \]
   Therefore, the total for these four days is:
   \[
   6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars}
   \]

3. Adding the totals from the first three days and the last four days gives us the total number of cars towed in the week:
   \[
   30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars}
   \]

The total number of cars towed that week is 54."
"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow to the required height.

First, let's convert Adam's current height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide Adam's height by 12:

\[ \text{Adam's current height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how much taller Adam needs to be to meet the 4 feet requirement:

\[ \text{Height difference} = 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:

\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, we can calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet:

\[ \text{Years required} = \frac{\frac{2}{3} \text{ feet}}{\frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year}} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.
2. Calculate the total cost to acquire the cars.
3. Determine the profit.
4. Calculate James's commission on the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.**

James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost to acquire the cars.**

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
\[ \text{Cost per car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000 \]

**Step 3: Determine the profit.**

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

**Step 4: Calculate James's commission on the profit.**

James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
\[ \text{Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

**Final Answer:**
\[ \boxed{17500} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many of the 100 riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate:

\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \]

So, 25 riders can stay upright.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are men. We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, which means 40% are men. Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is:

\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Given:
- The price of a diamond jewel is $2000.
- The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel.
- The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.

First, calculate the price of the gold jewel:
\[ \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \]

Next, calculate the price of the silver jewel:
\[ \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200 \]

Now, find the total price for all three jewels:
\[ \text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800 \]

The total price for all three jewels is \(\boxed{4800}\)."
"Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought:
16 (snowflake stamps) + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought:
19 (truck stamps) - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of each type of stamp together:
16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45 stamps.

Max bought a total of 45 stamps."
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob. 

Bob is driving at 55 mph, and Tom is driving at 70 mph. The difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, we can find the time it takes for Tom to catch up by dividing the distance by the relative speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"Naomi caught 17 fish.

Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, so Darren caught \(17 - 6 = 11\) fish.

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we first need to calculate the maximum total cost that would still allow the cost per class to be $10 or less.

Given:
- Total cost for 10 classes = $60
- Cost per class if 10 classes are attended = $60 / 10 = $6
- Maximum cost per class allowed = $10

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as \( x \). If he misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class in this scenario would be \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \).

We need to find the maximum \( x \) such that the cost per class does not exceed $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes and still have the cost per class be $10 or less. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{4}

1. **Determine the number of customers Jewel processes in a week:**
   - Jewel processes 50 customers per day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, Jewel processes \(50 \times 7 = 350\) customers per week.

2. **Determine the number of customers Julie processes in a week:**
   - Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel.
   - Therefore, Julie processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers per day.
   - Over 7 days, Julie processes \(100 \times 7 = 700\) customers per week.

3. **Calculate the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel:**
   - Total weekly production = Jewel's weekly production + Julie's weekly production
   - Total weekly production = \(350 + 700 = 1050\)

**Final numerical answer:**

"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

1. **Cost of one apple:**
   - Four apples cost $5.20.
   - Therefore, the cost of one apple is \( \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of one orange:**
   - Three oranges cost $3.30.
   - Therefore, the cost of one orange is \( \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost for 5 apples:**
   - Since one apple costs $1.30, 5 apples will cost \( 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \) dollars.

4. **Total cost for 5 oranges:**
   - Since one orange costs $1.10, 5 oranges will cost \( 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \) dollars.

5. **Total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:**
   - Adding the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we get \( 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \) dollars.

Therefore, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) it will take him to dig the hole is:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price of the truck to the cost of each of the additional features.

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so \( \frac{1}{3} \times 7500 = 2500 \) dollars
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so \( 2500 - 500 = 2000 \) dollars
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Now, we add all these costs together:

\[ 30000 + 7500 + 2500 + 2000 + 1500 = 43500 \]

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"First, let's calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise:

\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$20000 + (0.05 \times \$20000) = \$20000 + \$1000 = \$21000 \]

Next, we add the bonus, which is half a month's salary:

\[ \text{Bonus} = \frac{1}{2} \times \$21000 = \$10500 \]

So, Tim's total monthly income after the raise and bonus is:

\[ \text{Total Monthly Income} = \$21000 + \$10500 = \$31500 \]

To find out how much Tim will make in a year, we multiply his total monthly income by 12:

\[ \text{Annual Income} = \$31500 \times 12 = \$378000 \]

Therefore, Tim will make \(\$378000\) in a year."

"To determine how long it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay separately, and then add these times together.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.
- Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet per hour = 6 hours.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs at a rate of half the speed through clay, which is 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet per hour.
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.
- Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet per hour = 4 hours.

Now, we add the time for both soil and clay:
- Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

Therefore, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well."

Therefore, the total number of Instagram likes is 162000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost Clara paid for her pomegranates on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the voucher was:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She got a $2 discount, so the final amount she paid was:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost Sheila paid for her pomegranates on Wednesday.

The price per pomegranate on Wednesday was $30, so the total cost before the discount was:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

Sheila got a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount was:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final amount she paid was:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \text{ dollars} \]

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in the first month:**
   - Ariadne's sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
   - The sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from green hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month were \( 400 \times 2 = 800 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total sales for the first month:**
   - Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total sales in the first month = \( 400 + 800 = 1200 \) dollars.

3. **Determine the sales for the second month:**
   - Sales in the second month were \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total sales of the first month.
   - Therefore, sales in the second month = \( 1200 \times \frac{3}{4} = 900 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total sales for the two months:**
   - Total sales for two months = Sales in the first month + Sales in the second month
   - Total sales for two months = \( 1200 + 900 = 2100 \) dollars.

"To calculate the total cost for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses for the hanger and fuel.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane**: $150,000
2. **Monthly Hanger Rental**: $5000
3. **Monthly Fuel Cost**: $5000 * 2 = $10,000

Now, let's calculate the total monthly cost for the hanger and fuel:
\[ \text{Total Monthly Cost} = \$5000 + \$10,000 = \$15,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the first year (12 months):
\[ \text{Total Annual Cost for Hanger and Fuel} = \$15,000 \times 12 = \$180,000 \]

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the total annual cost for the hanger and fuel:
\[ \text{Total Cost for the First Year} = \$150,000 + \$180,000 = \$330,000 \]

So, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is:
\[ \$330,000 \]"
"Given that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, we can use this information to find out the cooking times for the other ingredients.

1. **Cooking time for rice (R):** 30 minutes
2. **Cooking time for pork (P):** It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. So, \( P = R + 20 \). Substituting the value of R, we get \( P = 30 + 20 = 50 \) minutes.
3. **Cooking time for beans (B):** Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. So, \( B = \frac{1}{2} (P + R) \). Substituting the values of P and R, we get \( B = \frac{1}{2} (50 + 30) = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \) minutes.

Now, to find the total cooking time for all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans:

\[ \text{Total cooking time} = R + P + B = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \]

So, it took Finley 120 minutes to cook all the food."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):

- Cost of 1/2 pound almonds: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5\) dollars
- Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars
- Total cost of the first mixture: \(5 + 5 = 10\) dollars

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):

- Cost of 1/5 pound almonds: \(\frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2\) dollars
- Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars
- Total cost of the second mixture: \(2 + 5 = 7\) dollars

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:

- Difference in cost: \(10 - 7 = 3\) dollars

Therefore, the first mixture costs $3 more than the second mixture."
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:
1. The total number of heads is 20:
\[ S + G = 20 \]

2. The total number of legs is 70:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To solve for \( S \) and \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

Final numerical answer:
15"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The original brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

To find 20% of $5:
\[ 5 \times 0.20 = 1 \]

So, the more expensive brand costs:
\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, which is 7 pounds:
\[ 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

He also buys a donut for $2. 

Now, we add the cost of the coffee and the donut:
\[ 42 + 2 = 44 \]

Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 44 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 44 \]"
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the cost of the other items Gus bought from the total amount he spent.

1. Cost of 2 bags of chips: \(2 \times \$2.00 = \$4.00\)
2. Cost of the bucket of fried chicken: \$8.00
3. Cost of the bottle of soda: \$1.00

Total cost of these items: \(\$4.00 + \$8.00 + \$1.00 = \$13.00\)

Gus spent a total of \$20.00. So, the cost of the apple pie is:

\(\$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00\)

The apple pie cost \$7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

Total newspapers delivered in a day = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers - (Newspapers to District A + Newspapers to District C)

Let's calculate:

Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - (198 + 209)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 407
Newspapers delivered to District B = 193

James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."
"To determine how many recipes John learns, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours John spends in the class.
2. Determine how many recipes he learns based on the total hours of class time.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours John spends in the class. The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, and it lasts for 6 weeks.

Total hours per week = 4 times/week * 2 hours/time = 8 hours/week
Total hours for 6 weeks = 8 hours/week * 6 weeks = 48 hours

Next, we need to find out how many recipes John learns. He learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time.

Number of recipes = Total hours / Hours per recipe = 48 hours / 1.5 hours/recipe

Now, let's perform the division:

48 / 1.5 = 32

So, John learns 32 recipes.

32"
"First, let's determine the number of history teachers on the basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

This means there are 90 history teachers. Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

So, there are 60 math teachers. Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

The math teachers collectively spend 360 hours sleeping in one day."
"First, let's determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's amount as follows:

\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, we know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's amount as follows:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, we add the amounts of money that Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia have:

\[ \text{Total money} = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360 \]

If they decide to share the money equally, each person would get:

\[ \text{Each person's share} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \]

So, if they decide to add together their money and share equally among them, each would have \(\boxed{120}\) dollars."
"The game originally consists of 4 quarters, each 12 minutes long. So, the total time for the 4 quarters is:

4 quarters * 12 minutes/quarter = 48 minutes

Since there was an extension of 5 minutes in the last quarter due to a tie, we add this to the original time:

48 minutes + 5 minutes = 53 minutes

The entire game lasted 53 minutes."
"First, we calculate the number of employees who are management. Since 20% of the 50 employees are management, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 management employees.

Next, we need to find out how many of these management employees oversee the entire company. Since 30% of the management employees oversee the company, we calculate:

\[ 30\% \times 10 = 0.30 \times 10 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of employees who oversee the company is 3."
"To calculate the total tablespoons of dry ingredients Svetlana would need for 16 muffins, we first need to determine the total amount of flour, sugar, and salt required for one muffin, and then multiply by 16.

For one muffin:
- Flour: 5 tablespoons
- Sugar: 3 tablespoons
- Salt: 0.25 tablespoon

Total dry ingredients for one muffin = 5 + 3 + 0.25 = 8.25 tablespoons

For 16 muffins:
Total dry ingredients = 8.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 132 tablespoons

Therefore, Svetlana would need 132 tablespoons of dry ingredients to make 16 muffins."

   - Total cost = $3.5 + $7.5 = $11.

4. Calculate the change Adam received:
   - Adam paid $15.
   - Total cost of candies = $11.
   - Change = $15 - $11 = $4.

Therefore, Adam got $4 in change."
"Christina had a total of 30 days of mood records. Out of these, 12 were good, 8 were bad, and the rest were neutral. 

First, let's calculate the number of neutral days:
- Total days = 30
- Good days = 12
- Bad days = 8
- Neutral days = Total days - Good days - Bad days
- Neutral days = 30 - 12 - 8 = 10

Now, let's account for the next three days:
- The next three days are good, neutral, and good.
- This adds 2 more good days to her record.

So, the total number of good days now is:
- Original good days = 12
- Additional good days = 2
- Total good days = 12 + 2 = 14

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 14."
"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To find the number of books Sally has, we need to solve for \( S \):
\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches.
2. Calculate the total height increase needed for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.
3. Determine how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow the required additional height.

Step 1: Convert the current height from feet to inches.
- 1 foot = 12 inches
- Current height = 20 feet = 20 * 12 inches = 240 inches

Step 2: Calculate the total height increase needed.
- Target height = 600 inches
- Current height = 240 inches
- Height increase needed = 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Step 3: Determine the number of days required for the bamboo to grow the additional height.
- Growth rate = 30 inches per day
- Days required = Height increase needed / Growth rate = 360 inches / 30 inches per day = 12 days

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to a height of 600 inches.

12 days"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are 8 more dogs, so now there are 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
3. James buys toys for these 12 dogs, so he now has 12 toys.
4. When he returns, there are twice as many dogs as before, so there are 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.
5. To accommodate these 24 dogs, James needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys.
6. After buying these toys, he has 12 (from the first purchase) + 12 (from the second purchase) = 24 toys.
7. When he comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs toys for those 3 dogs. Therefore, he needs to subtract 3 toys from his total, leaving him with 24 - 3 = 21 toys.

So, the total number of toys James needs is 21."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Total Investment**: The total initial investment is $1200.

2. **Dylan's Investment**: Dylan invests \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total amount.
   \[
   \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = 480
   \]

3. **Remaining Amount After Dylan's Investment**: Subtract Dylan's investment from the total.
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 1200 - 480 = 720

"First, let's determine Karen's hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many hours Karen works in two days. If she works 3 hours per day, then in two days she works:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate Karen's earnings for those 6 hours. Since she earns $20 per hour, her total earnings for two days are:

\[ 20 \times 6 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Karen earns \(\boxed{120}\) dollars in two days."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple proportion based on the given information.

If 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, then the ratio of potatoes to hash browns is 6:36, which simplifies to 1:6. This means that for every potato, you can make 6 hash browns.

Now, if you have 96 potatoes, you can calculate the number of hash browns as follows:

\[ \text{Number of hash browns} = 96 \times 6 = 576 \]

So, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes."
"To find out by how much the group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we first need to calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults.

1. The weight of one adult is 80 kg.
2. The total weight of 8 adults is \(80 \, \text{kg/adult} \times 8 \, \text{adults} = 640 \, \text{kg}\).
3. Adding Jack's weight to the total, we get \(640 \, \text{kg} + 80 \, \text{kg} = 720 \, \text{kg}\).

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. Therefore, the excess weight is:

\[720 \, \text{kg} - 700 \, \text{kg} = 20 \, \text{kg}\]

They will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"Given that Katarina has 68 cookies, we can work backwards to find out how many cookies Max and the Cookie Monster have.

1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has \(68 + 5 = 73\) cookies.
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has \(73 - 12 = 61\) cookies.
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has \(73 + 23 = 96\) cookies.

Now, to find the total number of cookies they have, we add up the cookies each person has:

\[68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298\]

Therefore, they have a total of 298 cookies."
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the extension is \( 0.5x \) cm. Additionally, she adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom. Therefore, the total length of the dress after these modifications is:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 \]

We know that the final length of the dress is 140 cm. So, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, we divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]

\[ x = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

Final answer: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's find the mowing rates for both modes:
- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes). Therefore, his mowing rate in ""turtle"" mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} \).
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""rabbit"" mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} \).

Now, we calculate the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode:
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes} \).
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes} \).

Finally, we add the times together to find the total time it took Chris to mow the entire lawn:
- Total time = 30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes.

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn."
"John and Jack have 30 minutes in total to walk to school. They have already spent 6 minutes to get to the corner and another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. 

First, we add the time spent so far:
6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

Now, we subtract the time already spent from the total time they have:
30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes

So, they have 11 minutes longer to get to school without being late."
"Catherine buys:
- 1 kilo of apples for $4

$4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14

Therefore, Catherine pays a total of $14."
"Greta bakes 30 cookies. Celinda bakes twice as many, which means Celinda bakes \(30 \times 2 = 60\) cookies.

Together, they have \(30 + 60 = 90\) cookies.

They eat 10 of the cookies, so the number of cookies left is \(90 - 10 = 80\).

Therefore, there are 80 cookies in the box."
"Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as \( x \). Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of that twin would be \( x + 7 \).

The other triplet and the other twin would be the same age as the younger triplet and the younger twin, respectively, because they are part of a set of twins and a set of triplets. Therefore, the age of the other triplet is also \( x \), and the age of the other twin is \( x + 7 \).

The combined ages of all four individuals are given as 44. So, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 7) + x + (x + 7) = 44 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 4x + 14 = 44 \]

Subtract 14 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 7.5 \]

So, the age of the younger triplet is 7.5 years. The age of one of the twins, who is 7 years older than the triplet, is:

\[ x + 7 = 7.5 + 7 = 14.5 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is 14.5 years old."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends on his homework:

- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Converting 3 hours into minutes:

3 hours = 3 × 60 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, we subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner to find out how much time John has left for a nap:

Time for nap = Total time before dinner - Time spent on homework
Time for nap = 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

John has 100 minutes to nap."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the candies. We know that 4 candies cost $3.20, so the cost of one candy is:

\[ \text{Cost of one candy} = \frac{3.20}{4} = 0.80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 candies:

\[ \text{Cost of 10 candies} = 10 \times 0.80 = 8.00 \]

Now, we know that each lollipop costs $0.40, so the cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ \text{Cost of 10 lollipops} = 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the 10 lollipops and the 10 candies to find the total cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8.00 + 4.00 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $12.00."
"First, let's calculate how many coins Rong saves in a month and then in a year. Rong saves 20 coins every month. 

In a year, Rong saves:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 240 \text{ coins/year} \]

Now, let's calculate how many coins Neil saves in a month. Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong each month. So, Neil saves:
\[ 20 \text{ coins} + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \text{ coins} \right) = 20 \text{ coins} + 8 \text{ coins} = 28 \text{ coins/month} \]

In a year, Neil saves:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 336 \text{ coins/year} \]

Now, we need to find out how many coins they have saved in ten years. For Rong:
\[ 240 \text{ coins/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

For Neil:
\[ 336 \text{ coins/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding the savings of Rong and Neil together:
\[ 2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

Therefore, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:
\[ 5760 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and the dog needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:

\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Let the total bill be \( x \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:

\[ 0.60x \]

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:

\[ x = 40 + 0.60x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. Subtract \( 0.60x \) from both sides:

\[ x - 0.60x = 40 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 0.40x = 40 \]

Now, divide both sides by 0.40:

\[ x = \frac{40}{0.40} = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:

\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, John leaves with $25."
"To find the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - Therefore, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in a crate.
   - The total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in a crate.
   - The total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - Oranges cost three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1.
   - Therefore, one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in a crate.
   - The total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

4. **Total Cost of the Crate:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges.
   - Total cost = Cost of bananas + Cost of apples + Cost of oranges

"To find the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter, we need to determine the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares**: We are given that there are 14 red squares.
2. **Blue Squares**: There are 4 more blue squares than red squares. So, the number of blue squares is \(14 + 4 = 18\).
3. **Green Squares**: There are 6 more green squares than blue squares. So, the number of green squares is \(18 + 6 = 24\).
4. **White Squares**: There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. So, the number of white squares is \(24 - 12 = 12\).

Now, we sum up all the squares:
\[ 14 \text{ (red)} + 18 \text{ (blue)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 12 \text{ (white)} = 68 \]

Therefore, the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter is \(\boxed{68}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of high chairs and regular chairs currently available:**
   - The restaurant has 8 high chairs.
   - The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Therefore, the number of regular chairs is \(5 \times 8 = 40\).

2. **Calculate the total number of chairs currently available:**
   - Total chairs = high chairs + regular chairs = \(8 + 40 = 48\).

3. **Determine the total number of chairs needed:**
   - There are 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function, so the total number of chairs needed is \(42 + 15 = 57\).

4. **Calculate the number of additional chairs needed:**
   - Additional chairs needed = total chairs needed - total chairs currently available = \(57 - 48 = 9\).

Therefore, Mia has to get \(\boxed{9}\) more chairs."
"To find the number of 8 point bucks, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bucks in the field.
2. Calculate the number of 8 point bucks from the total number of bucks.

Step 1: Calculate the number of bucks.
50 percent of the 50 deer are bucks. So, we calculate:
\[ 50 \times 0.50 = 25 \]
There are 25 bucks in the field.

Step 2: Calculate the number of 8 point bucks.
20 percent of the bucks are 8 points. So, we calculate:

"First, let's calculate the points collected by each student:

1. Adam has 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. So, Betty's points are:
   \[
   50 + (0.30 \times 50) = 50 + 15 = 65 \text{ points}
   \]
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom's points are:
   \[
   65 - 30 = 35 \text{ points}
   \]
4. Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. So, Martha's points are:
   \[
   3 \times 35 = 105 \text{ points}
   \]

Now, let's sum up the points collected by all the students:
\[
50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 \text{ points}
\]

The class needs a total of 400 points to go on the trip. Therefore, the points the class is missing are:

"First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks set off by the city:

- The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each.
- Total fireworks from the city = 15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = 300 fireworks.

Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks:

- Hannah's view of the city's fireworks = 40% of 300 = 0.40 * 300 = 120 fireworks.

Next, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah sets off in her backyard:

- Hannah is setting off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each.
- Total fireworks from Hannah = 3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = 15 fireworks.

Now, we add the fireworks Hannah sees from the city and the fireworks she sets off herself:

- Total fireworks Hannah sees = 120 (city fireworks) + 15 (her own fireworks) = 135 fireworks.

Therefore, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is 135."
"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person saves a seat and buys enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats. Since each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks, and there are 20 people, the group will buy:

- \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) drinks
- \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) snacks

Each drink and snack costs $2, so the total cost for the drinks is:

\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

And the total cost for the snacks is:

\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount spent on drinks and snacks:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Number of Females and Males:**
   - Number of females = 6
   - Number of males = 8 (including Larry)

2. **Dumplings Eaten by Females:**
   - Each female ate 3 dumplings.
   - Total dumplings eaten by females = 6 females * 3 dumplings/female = 18 dumplings

3. **Dumplings Eaten by Males:**
   - Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female.
   - Therefore, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.
   - Total dumplings eaten by males = 8 males * 4 dumplings/male = 32 dumplings

4. **Total Dumplings Cooked:**
   - Total dumplings = Dumplings eaten by females + Dumplings eaten by males
   - Total dumplings = 18 dumplings + 32 dumplings = 50 dumplings

Therefore, Larry cooked a total of 50 dumplings."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much money Gerald and Julia each received when they divided $100 in the ratio 3:2.

The total parts of the ratio 3:2 add up to 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Each part is therefore worth $100 / 5 = $20.

Since Gerald's share is 3 parts, he received 3 * $20 = $60.

If Gerald spent $10 on a book, the amount of money he has left is $60 - $10 = $50.

Therefore, Gerald has $50 left."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of Martha's turtle. We know that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and that the cat can run at a speed of 15 feet per second.

Let's denote the speed of the turtle as \( v \) feet per second. According to the information given, the cat's speed is 5 times the turtle's speed, so we can write the equation:

\[ 15 = 5v \]

Solving for \( v \):

\[ v = \frac{15}{5} = 3 \text{ feet per second} \]

Now that we know the turtle's speed is 3 feet per second, we can calculate how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. The distance \( d \) traveled is given by the formula:

\[ d = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ d = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find out how many more hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first need to determine how much more money they need to raise. 

The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount they need to raise is:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money they raise per hour. They raised $2100 in the first 3 hours, so the amount raised per hour is:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Now, to find out how many more hours they need to fundraise to raise the remaining $4200, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

So, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours. 

Therefore, the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal is:

\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract the industrial usage from the total city usage to find the non-industrial usage.

Step 1: The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. So, the industrial usage is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 \text{ or } 32\% \]

Step 2: Subtract the industrial usage from the total city usage to find the non-industrial usage:
\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

Therefore, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

"To determine the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we first need to calculate the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream.

For chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Next, we calculate the total production in 48 hours for each type of ice cream.

For chocolate ice cream:
- In 48 hours, the factory would produce \( 50 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- In 48 hours, the factory would produce \( 12.5 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Finally, we add the total production of both types of ice cream to get the overall total:
- Total quarts = \( 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \).

Therefore, the total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 3000 quarts."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Marcus ordered:

- Croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each = 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each = 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 muffins at $1.00 each = 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost before the discount:

Total cost = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off, we need to calculate 10% of $50.00 and subtract it from the total:

10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Subtract the discount from the total cost:

Total bill after discount = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is $45.00."
"Erin has $6.00 and each scoop costs $1.50. With the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. 

First, let's calculate how many scoops she can buy with her $6.00 without considering the deal:
\[ \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

Now, let's see how the deal works with these 4 scoops. For every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 free. So, with 4 scoops, she can get 2 free scoops (since 4 divided by 2 is 2).

Therefore, the total number of scoops she will have is:
\[ 4 \text{ (bought)} + 2 \text{ (free)} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

So, Erin should buy 4 scoops to get a total of 6 scoops of ice cream."
"To determine how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy each person eats in two weeks and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total amount of candy Ginger eats in two weeks:
- Ginger eats 4 pieces a day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- Therefore, Ginger eats \(4 \times 14 = 56\) pieces of candy in two weeks.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of candy Amy eats in two weeks:
- Amy eats 3 pieces a day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- Therefore, Amy eats \(3 \times 14 = 42\) pieces of candy in two weeks.

Now, we need to find out how much candy each person has left after two weeks:
- Ginger started with 100 pieces and ate 56 pieces, so she has \(100 - 56 = 44\) pieces left.
- Amy started with 100 pieces and ate 42 pieces, so she has \(100 - 42 = 58\) pieces left.

Finally, we need to find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger:
- Amy has 58 pieces and Ginger has 44 pieces.
- The difference is \(58 - 44 = 14\).

Therefore, after two weeks, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger.

"To find out how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the area that needs to be covered: two thirds of the 36 square feet bathroom.
2. Determine the number of tiles needed for that area, given that 24 tiles are required per square foot.

First, calculate two thirds of the bathroom area:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \text{ sq ft} = 24 \text{ sq ft} \]

Next, since Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles per square foot, we multiply the area to be covered by the number of tiles per square foot:
\[ 24 \text{ sq ft} \times 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft} = 576 \text{ tiles} \]

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom."
"To determine how much James saved, we need to calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries and compare it to the cost of buying the same amount at the store.

1. **Cost of picking the blueberries:**
   - Initial cost to go picking: $20
   - Cost per pound: $1.5
   - Pounds of blueberries picked: 30

   Total cost for picking = Initial cost + (Cost per pound * Pounds picked)
   Total cost for picking = $20 + ($1.5 * 30)

"To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of having the city fix it and the total cost of Ron fixing it himself, then find the difference between these two amounts.

1. **Cost of having the city fix the pothole:**
   - The pothole will do $450 worth of damage to Ron's car if it's not fixed.
   - The city council will fine Ron $120 for fixing it himself.
   - Therefore, the total cost if the city fixes it is $450 (damage to car) - $120 (fine) = $330.

2. **Cost of Ron fixing the pothole himself:**
   - Ron will have to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, each costing $25.
   - The total cost for the asphalt is 3 buckets * $25/bucket = $75.
   - Ron will also have to pay the $120 fine for unauthorized road maintenance.
   - Therefore, the total cost if Ron fixes it himself is $75 (asphalt) + $120 (fine) = $195.

3. **Savings by fixing the pothole himself:**
   - The savings is the difference between the cost of having the city fix it and the cost of Ron fixing it himself.
   - Savings = $330 (city fixing) - $195 (Ron fixing) = $135.

Ron saves $135 by fixing the pothole himself.

"First, let's calculate the total number of pizzas ordered. Since there are 5 people (Bryce and his four friends) and each ordered one pizza, the total number of pizzas is 5.

Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate how many slices each group of friends ate.

Bryce and two friends ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas. Since there are 3 people in this group, the total number of slices they ate is:
\[ 3 \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \times 12 \right) = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

The two remaining friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas. So, the total number of slices they ate is:
\[ 2 \times \left( \frac{3}{4} \times 12 \right) = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Now, we add the slices eaten by both groups to find the total number of slices eaten:
\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices to find the number of slices left:
\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \]

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches.
2. Set up an equation based on the given relationship between Topher's and Bobby's shoe lengths.
3. Solve the equation for the length of Bobby's shoe.

First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe to inches. Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the feet to inches and then add the additional 4 inches:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]
\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, Topher's shoe is 100 inches long.

Next, we know that the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as \( x \) inches. According to the problem, we can write the following equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for both students' cars and teachers' cars separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each student's car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The number of students' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 64 = 16 \]

Since each of these 16 cars has 4 windows, the total number of windows smashed for the students' cars is:
\[ 16 \times 4 = 64 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teacher's car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows.

The number of teachers' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 32 = 24 \]

Since each of these 24 cars has 2 windows, the total number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars is:
\[ 24 \times 2 = 48 \]

Finally, we sum the windows smashed for both students' and teachers' cars:
\[ 64 + 48 = 112 \]

Therefore, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:
\[ \boxed{112} \]"
"To find the percentage of spools that are blue, we first need to determine the total number of spools and then calculate the proportion that are blue.

1. Calculate the total number of spools:
   - Light blue: 15
   - Dark blue: 45
   - Light green: 40
   - Dark green: 50

   Total spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

2. Calculate the number of blue spools:
   - Light blue: 15
   - Dark blue: 45

   Total blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60

3. Calculate the percentage of blue spools:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Total blue spools}}{\text{Total spools}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\%
   \]

The percentage of her spools that are blue is 40%."
"At 8:00, there were 5000 people in line to vote.

By midday (12:00), \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the people had voted. So, the number of people who had voted by midday is:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000
\]

The number of people remaining in line by midday is:
\[
5000 - 2000 = 3000
\]

By 16:00, \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the remaining people had voted. So, the number of people who had voted by 16:00 from the remaining 3000 is:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000
\]

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:
\[
3000 - 2000 = 1000
\]

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. Over 30 days, he will chew:

\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Since each pack contains 15 pieces of gum, the number of packs he will need is:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of smores needed:**
   - **Kids:** 9 kids want 2 smores each, so \(9 \times 2 = 18\) smores.
   - **Adults:** 6 adults will eat 1 smore each, so \(6 \times 1 = 6\) smores.
   - **Total smores needed:** \(18 + 6 = 24\) smores.

2. **Calculate the number of smores that can be made from one box of graham crackers:**
   - Each sleeve makes 8 smores.
   - There are 3 sleeves in a box, so \(3 \times 8 = 24\) smores per box.

3. **Determine the number of boxes needed:**
   - Since one box can make 24 smores and we need 24 smores, we need exactly 1 box.

Therefore, they will need **1 box** of graham crackers."
"Given that Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate the ages of her father and mother as follows:

1. Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we calculate her father's age as:
\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

2. Dora's mother is four years younger than her father. So, we calculate her mother's age as:
\[ \text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Now, we add the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother to find the total combined age:
\[ \text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

Therefore, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87."
"To solve this problem, we need to divide the total amount of money Greg found by the number of people who will share it, including Greg himself.

"Cindy's math and science books each weigh 2 pounds, so together they weigh:
2 pounds + 2 pounds = 4 pounds

Her French book weighs 4 pounds.

Her English book weighs 3 pounds.

Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book, so it weighs:
2 * 3 pounds = 6 pounds

Now, we add up the weights of all her books:
Math and science books: 4 pounds
French book: 4 pounds
English book: 3 pounds
History book: 6 pounds

Total weight = 4 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17 pounds

The total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds."
"Candidate A got 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, we can calculate the number of votes for candidate A as follows:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate A} = 20\% \times 100 = 20 \]

Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. Therefore, we calculate the votes for candidate B as follows:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + (50\% \times 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

The total number of votes is 100. The votes for candidate C can be found by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (\text{Votes for candidate A} + \text{Votes for candidate B}) = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Therefore, candidate C got 50 votes."
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, Beck has:

\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \text{ apples} \]

Next, if Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Boris will have:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \text{ apples} \]

And Beck will have:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \text{ apples} \]

Now, to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this exchange, we subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris.

"To determine how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract that from the initial 32 ounces.

1. **Giant Cubes:**
   - Each giant cube uses 4 ounces.
   - Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   - Total water used for giant cubes: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) ounces.

2. **Medium Cubes:**
   - Each medium cube uses 2 ounces.
   - Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   - Total water used for medium cubes: \(7 \times 2 = 14\) ounces.

3. **Small Cubes:**
   - Each small cube uses 1/2 ounce.
   - Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   - Total water used for small cubes: \(8 \times \frac{1}{2} = 4\) ounces.

Now, we add up the total water used for all the cubes:
\[12 \text{ ounces (giant cubes)} + 14 \text{ ounces (medium cubes)} + 4 \text{ ounces (small cubes)} = 30 \text{ ounces}\]

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial 32 ounces:
\[32 \text{ ounces} - 30 \text{ ounces} = 2 \text{ ounces}\]

So, Peter has \(\boxed{2}\) ounces of water left."
"Given that Clara has 20 books and she has twice as many books as Steven, we can determine that Steven has:

\[ \text{Steven's books} = \frac{\text{Clara's books}}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so:

\[ \text{Alice's books} = \text{Steven's books} + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:

\[ \text{Clara's books} - \text{Alice's books} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Clara has 4 more books than Alice."
"Given that a gallon jar costs $5 and it costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can determine the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

\[ \text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]
\[ \text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total amount of money spent:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 50 + 48 = 98 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money she spent on 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars is $98."

"Since the two classes have a total of 80 students and each class has the same amount of students, we can divide the total number of students by 2 to find the number of students in each class:

\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \]

So, each class has 40 students.

Given that 40% of the students in each class are girls, we can calculate the number of girls in each class as follows:

\[ 40\% \times 40 = 0.40 \times 40 = 16 \]

Since each class has 40 students and 16 of them are girls, the number of boys in each class is:

\[ 40 - 16 = 24 \]

Therefore, the number of boys in each class is 24."

"Given that Sean has 56 marbles, and Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, we can determine the number of marbles Cal has. If Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, then Cal has twice as many marbles as Sean. Therefore, Cal has:

\[ 56 \times 2 = 112 \text{ marbles} \]

Next, we know that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. So, Carl has:

\[ 56 \times 4 = 224 \text{ marbles} \]

To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add the number of marbles each has:

\[ 224 + 112 = 336 \]

Therefore, Carl and Cal have a combined total of 336 marbles."
"First, we determine how many students are in each of the six groups by dividing the total number of students by the number of groups:

\[ \frac{54}{6} = 9 \]

This means each of the six groups has 9 students.

Next, we need to find out how many students are required for 12 groups, assuming each group should have the same number of students as the original groups (9 students per group):

\[ 12 \times 9 = 108 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more students are needed to form these 12 groups:

\[ 108 - 54 = 54 \]

Since we need 54 more students to form the additional groups, we can now determine how many more groups are needed. We know that each group should have 9 students, so we divide the additional number of students by the number of students per group:

\[ \frac{54}{9} = 6 \]

Therefore, 6 more groups are needed to form the required 12 groups.

"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

1. **Weekday Rentals:**
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays.
   - Since 60 chairs are rented each weekday, the total number of chairs rented during weekdays in one 4-week month is \(60 \times 20 = 1200\) chairs.

2. **Weekend Rentals:**
   - There are 2 weekend days in a week.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.
   - Since 100 chairs are rented each weekend day, the total number of chairs rented during weekends in one 4-week month is \(100 \times 8 = 800\) chairs.

3. **Total Rentals in One 4-Week Month:**
   - The total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month is the sum of weekday and weekend rentals, which is \(1200 + 800 = 2000\) chairs.

4. **Total Rentals in Two 4-Week Months:**
   - Since the pattern repeats, the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months is \(2000 \times 2 = 4000\) chairs.

Therefore, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is 4000."

1. **Initial Stickers and Conversion Rates:**
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.
   - A small sticker is worth one small button.
   - A large button is worth three small stickers.

2. **Lorraine's Initial Stickers:**
   - 30 small stickers
   - 40 large stickers

3. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons.

5. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small stickers, so 20 large stickers = 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 60 small stickers = 60 small buttons.

6. **Total Buttons Calculation:**
   - From small stickers: 27 small buttons
   - From large stickers: 20 large buttons (each large button is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large buttons = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons)

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which means the sum of the votes in favor and against the regulation is 33. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is:

\[ \boxed{22} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need size extra-small.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra-small. So, \(2 \times 11 = 22\) students need size small.
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So, \(22 - 4 = 18\) students need size medium.
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. So, \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\) students need size large.
5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. So, \(9 + 6 = 15\) students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up all the shirts:

- XS: 11

Given that one third of the Pomeranians are girls and there are 6 Pomeranian girls, we can set up the following equation to find the total number of Pomeranians:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times \text{Total Pomeranians} = 6
\]

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

\[
\text{Total Pomeranians} = 6 \times 3 = 18
\]

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's denote the total number of puppies by \( P \). According to the problem, two thirds of \( P \) are Pomeranians, so we can write:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times P = 18
\]

To find \( P \), we multiply both sides of the equation by \(\frac{3}{2}\):

\[
P = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27
\]

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies."
"Jayden initially had $70. Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. So, the total amount Jayden has now is $70 + $45 = $115. The camera costs $200. Therefore, the amount Jayden still needs to buy the camera is $200 - $115 = $85.

Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera."
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3.5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 3.5:
\[ x = \frac{250}{3.5} = 71.42857142857143 \]

Since the third house needs \( 2x \) cases of shingles, we calculate:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 71.42857142857143 = 142.85714285714286 \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number (since you can't have a fraction of a case of shingles), the third house will need 143 cases of shingles.

Final numerical answer:
143"
"Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so she spends:

Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so he spends:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3 each, so he spends:
\[ 1 \times 3 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Together, they spend:
\[ 6 + 5 + 3 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount spent by Leila, Jack, and Chase to make a salad for the potluck is:
\[ 14 \text{ dollars} \]"
"To find out how many pears George has, we start by calculating 45% of the number of bananas he has. Since George has 200 bananas, we calculate 45% of 200:

\[ 45\% \times 200 = 0.45 \times 200 = 90 \]

This means George has 90 more pears than bananas. Since he has 200 bananas, the number of pears he has is:

\[ 200 + 90 = 290 \]

Now, to find the total number of fruits George has, we add the number of bananas and the number of pears:

\[ 200 + 290 = 490 \]

Therefore, George has a total of 490 fruits."
"Marissa initially had $80. She spent $20 on a ball, so she had $80 - $20 = $60 left. Each candy bar costs $5. To find out how many candy bars she could buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one candy bar: $60 / $5 = 12.

Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy."
"To make 1 liter of juice, Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges. Therefore, to make 4 liters of juice, Sam would need:

\[ 5 \, \text{kg/liter} \times 4 \, \text{liters} = 20 \, \text{kg} \]

Each kilogram of oranges costs $3. So, for 20 kilograms of oranges, the cost would be:

\[ 20 \, \text{kg} \times \$3/\text{kg} = \$60 \]

Sam would have to spend \(\boxed{60}\) dollars to make 4 liters of juice."
"Ezra read 300 books in one hour and decided to read 150 more. So, the total number of books Ezra read is:

300 + 150 = 450 books

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour, Ahmed read half the number of books Ezra read in that hour:

300 / 2 = 150 books

Now, to find out how many books they have read altogether, we add the number of books Ezra read to the number of books Ahmed read:

450 + 150 = 600 books

They have read a total of 600 books altogether."
"To calculate Tanya's earnings for the two days, we need to break down her earnings for each day and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour, so for 5 hours, she earns \(5 \times 15 = 75\) dollars.
- Since she taught more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5, making her total for Monday \(75 + 5 = 80\) dollars.

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour, so for 2 hours, she earns \(2 \times 15 = 30\) dollars.
- Since she did not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5.

Now, we sum up her earnings for both days:
- Monday: $80
- Wednesday: $30

Total earnings: \(80 + 30 = 110\) dollars.

**Final Answer:**

"To find out how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type sold and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold:
- They sell 5 of each of the 4 vanilla scents.
- Total vanilla scents sold = 5 * 4 = 20

Next, let's calculate the total number of fruity scents sold:
- They sell 2 of each of the 8 fruity scents.
- Total fruity scents sold = 2 * 8 = 16

Now, we find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold:
- Difference = 20 - 16 = 4

Therefore, 4 more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents."
"First, let's calculate how much money Bennet makes from selling the eggplants.

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

So, Bennet makes $60 from the eggplants.

Next, we need to determine how much more money Bennet needs to make to reach his goal of $135:
\[ 135 - 60 = 75 \]

Bennet needs to make $75 from selling the 25 ears of corn. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the total amount he needs by the number of ears of corn:
\[ \frac{75}{25} = 3 \]

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of time Tatiana has for her weekend activities:

\[ 7 \text{ hours (Saturday)} + 5 \text{ hours (Sunday)} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know she spends 3 hours reading. So, the remaining time is:

\[ 12 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Tatiana plays video games for \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the remaining 9 hours:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can find out how much time she spends playing soccer by subtracting the time spent on reading and video games from the total remaining time:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours (reading)} - 3 \text{ hours (video games)} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

To find the percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we use the formula:

\[ \left( \frac{\text{time spent playing soccer}}{\text{total time}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \left( \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{12 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, Tatiana spends 25% of her weekend playing soccer."
"Anthony initially had 50 pencils.

First, he gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]
So, Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon, leaving him with:
\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \]

Next, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15 \]
So, Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie, leaving him with:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils."
"To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time he spends driving to the museum, the time he spends driving back, and the time he spends at the museum.

1. **Time to the museum:**
   - Distance to the museum: 150 miles
   - Speed: 75 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

2. **Time back from the museum:**
   - The distance back is the same, 150 miles.
   - Speed: 75 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

3. **Time spent at the museum:**
   - 6 hours

Now, we add up all the times:
- Time to the museum: 2 hours
- Time at the museum: 6 hours
- Time back from the museum: 2 hours

Total time = 2 hours + 6 hours + 2 hours = 10 hours

Therefore, Jack is gone from home for 10 hours."
"To find out how many wheels Henry will need to assemble all the toys, we can calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles separately, and then sum them up.

For the cars:
- Henry needs to assemble 57 cars.
- Each car requires 4 wheels.
- Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is \(57 \times 4 = 228\) wheels.

For the motorcycles:
- Henry needs to assemble 73 motorcycles.
- Each motorcycle requires 2 wheels.
- Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is \(73 \times 2 = 146\) wheels.

Now, we add the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles to find the total number of wheels required:
- Total wheels required = \(228 + 146 = 374\) wheels.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling all the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the number of wheels in the box:
- Wheels left = \(650 - 374 = 276\).

Therefore, the number of wheels left is 276."

20% of $1000 is calculated as:
\[ 1000 \times \frac{20}{100} = 1000 \times 0.20 = 200 \]

Subtract the discount from the original price:
\[ 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

So, after a 20% discount, you have to pay $800."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total number of movies**: 600

2. **Movies in series**: A third of the movies are in series, so:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \text{ movies}
   \]
   The cost for these series is $6 each, so the total cost for the series is:
   \[
   200 \times 6 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Remaining movies**: Subtract the movies in series from the total:
   \[
   600 - 200 = 400 \text{ movies}
   \]

4. **Older movies**: 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so:
   \[
   0.4 \times 400 = 160 \text{ movies}
   \]
   The cost for these older movies is $5 each, so the total cost for the older movies is:
   \[
   160 \times 5 = 800 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Normal movies**: The remaining movies are normal movies, so:
   \[
   400 - 160 = 240 \text{ movies}
   \]
   The cost for these normal movies is $10 each, so the total cost for the normal movies is:
   \[

Therefore, Winston spent \(\$38.00\) on fruit."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the Llesis family, which is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked.

1. **Calculate the distance driven:**
   - They drove for 4.5 hours (since the total time was 6 hours and they hiked for 1.5 hours).
   - Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour.
   - Distance driven = Speed * Time = 50 miles/hour * 4.5 hours = 225 miles.

2. **Calculate the hiking speed:**
   - Their hiking speed was 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
   - Half of their driving speed = 50 miles/hour / 2 = 25 miles/hour.
   - Hiking speed = 25 miles/hour - 5 miles/hour = 20 miles/hour.

3. **Calculate the distance hiked:**
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours.
   - Distance hiked = Speed * Time = 20 miles/hour * 1.5 hours = 30 miles.

4. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked = 225 miles + 30 miles = 255 miles.

The total distance to their vacation spot is 255 miles."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( E_e \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( A_e \) be the number of enemies Ava jumps on.
- Let \( E_b \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( A_b \ be the number of berries Ava collects.
- Let \( E_t \) be the time left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.
- Let \( A_t \) be the time left on the timer when Ava finishes the level.

From the problem, we know:
- \( A_e = E_e + 8 \)
- \( A_b = E_b + 3 \)
- \( A_t = E_t + 4 \)

The points are calculated as follows:
- Points for enemies: \( 10 \times \text{number of enemies} \)
- Points for berries: \( 5 \times \text{number of berries} \)
- Points for time: \( 30 \times \text{time left on the timer} \)

So, the total score for Emma is:
\[ \text{Score}_E = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \]

And the total score for Ava is:
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10A_e + 5A_b + 30A_t \]

Substituting the values of \( A_e \), \( A_b \), and \( A_t \) in terms of \( E_e \), \( E_b \), and \( E_t \):
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(E_b + 3) + 30(E_t + 4) \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120 \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215 \]

Now, we can find the difference between their scores:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Score}_A - \text{Score}_E \]
\[ \text{Difference} = (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215) - (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 215 \]

Therefore, the difference between their two scores is:
\[ \boxed{215} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The total cost of the four pizzas is $64.
2. Two of the pizzas cost $30 in total.
3. We need to find the cost of each of the other two pizzas, which cost the same amount.

First, we calculate the total cost of the remaining two pizzas:
\[ \text{Total cost of four pizzas} - \text{Total cost of two pizzas} = 64 - 30 = 34 \]

Since the remaining two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of these two pizzas by 2:
\[ \text{Cost of each of the other two pizzas} = \frac{34}{2} = 17 \]

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas cost $17.

"Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days. So, the number of rides in those 5 days is:

3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides

On the other two days, they ride twice the times they do on the usual days. So, on those days, they ride:

2 * 3 rides/day = 6 rides/day

For the two days, the total number of rides is:

6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 rides

Adding the rides from the 5 days and the 2 days together, we get the total number of rides in a week:

15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides

So, they ride their bikes 27 times a week."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Initially, Bob had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.
2. He bought 17 more fish from the pet store, and after adding them, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote:
- \( O \) as the number of orange fish Bob bought.
- \( W \) as the number of white fish Bob bought.

After buying the fish, the total number of orange fish is \( 3 + O \) and the total number of white fish is \( 4 + W \).

According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This can be expressed as:
\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]
\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17:
\[ O + W = 17 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( O - 2W = 5 \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

We can solve this system by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. From the second equation, we can express \( O \) in terms of \( W \):
\[ O = 17 - W \]

Substitute \( O \) in the first equation:
\[ 17 - W - 2W = 5 \]
\[ 17 - 3W = 5 \]
\[ -3W = 5 - 17 \]
\[ -3W = -12 \]
\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Andy travels to work in a week.
2. Determine the amount of fuel used for this distance.
3. Calculate the cost of the fuel used.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance traveled in a week.**

Andy travels 5 miles one way to work. Therefore, the round trip distance is:
\[ 5 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

Since he works from Monday to Friday, the total distance for the week is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ miles} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount of fuel used.**

Andy's car has a fuel efficiency of 10 miles per gallon. Therefore, the amount of fuel used for 50 miles is:
\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the fuel used.**

The price of regular gas is $3 per gallon. Therefore, the cost of 5 gallons of gas is:
\[ 5 \text{ gallons} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received from her aunt.

Carrie received ten twenties, which is:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

She also received 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount from the quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Carrie received is:
\[ 200 + 35 = 235 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she spent. She spent \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the twenties and all the quarters.

The amount spent on the twenties is:

"To find out how many fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo has 5 tomato plants.
- Therefore, the total number of tomatoes is \(22 \times 5 = 110\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants.
- Therefore, the total number of eggplants is \(4 \times 8 = 32\).

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:
- Total number of fruits = Total number of tomatoes + Total number of eggplants
- Total number of fruits = \(110 + 32 = 142\).

"First, we need to determine the temperature during the night. If it's 33 degrees colder at night than during the day, and the day temperature is 45 degrees, then the night temperature is:

\[ 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, we need to find out how much the temperature needs to be raised to prevent the pipes from freezing. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. Therefore, the temperature needs to be raised from 12 degrees to 32 degrees:

\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Since each log of wood burns raises the temperature by 5 degrees, we need to calculate how many logs are required to raise the temperature by 20 degrees:

\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing."
"First, we need to determine the number of 9-person groups that can be formed from 90 people. This is calculated by dividing the total number of people by the group size:

\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$160 \]

Calculate the pay for the additional 3 hours:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$90 \]

Add the two amounts to find the total pay for the day:
\[ \$160 + \$90 = \$250 \]

Therefore, Jamie was paid \(\boxed{250}\) dollars for her work on Tuesday."
"The zookeeper counts 12 female lions. There are half as many male lions, which means there are \(12 \div 2 = 6\) male lions. Additionally, there are 14 lion cubs.

To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and cubs together:

\[12 + 6 + 14 = 32\]

There are 32 lions in the enclosure."
"First, we need to calculate the discount on the jeans. The original price of the jeans is $40, and they are advertised at 25% off.

To find the discount amount, we calculate 25% of $40:
\[ 25\% \times 40 = 0.25 \times 40 = 10 \]

So, the discount is $10. Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

The sale price of the jeans is $30. Mike pays with a $50 bill. To find out how much money he will have left over, we subtract the sale price from the amount he paid:
\[ 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Mike will have left over is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"The company hires 20 new employees every month. Over three months, the total number of new hires is:

20 employees/month * 3 months = 60 new employees

The initial workforce is 200 employees, and with the addition of 60 new employees, the total workforce after three months is:

200 initial employees + 60 new employees = 260 employees

Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month. Therefore, the total monthly payroll for 260 employees is:

260 employees * $4000/employee = $1,040,000

To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we multiply the monthly payroll by 3:

$1,040,000/month * 3 months = $3,120,000

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is $3,120,000."
"To find out how long the choir will be caroling, we need to calculate the total time for singing both songs based on the given frequencies and durations.

1. ""Deck the Halls"" is sung twice, and each time it takes 150 seconds. So, the total time for ""Deck the Halls"" is:
   \[
   2 \times 150 = 300 \text{ seconds}
   \]

2. ""Jingle Bells"" is sung once, and it takes 240 seconds. So, the total time for ""Jingle Bells"" is:
   \[
   1 \times 240 = 240 \text{ seconds}
   \]

3. Adding these times together gives the total caroling time:
   \[
   300 + 240 = 540 \text{ seconds}
   \]

Therefore, the choir will be caroling for 540 seconds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Billy's Salary Calculation:**
   - Billy's starting hourly rate: $10 per hour.
   - After 2 months, his hourly rate increased to $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.
   - On his first anniversary, his hourly rate increased to $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.
   - If Billy works 20 hours, his earnings are: $11.50 * 20 = $230.

2. **Sally's Salary Calculation:**
   - Sally's starting hourly rate is $0.50 more than Billy's starting rate, so it is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.
   - If Sally works 20 hours, her earnings are: $10.50 * 20 = $210.

3. **Difference in Earnings:**
   - The difference in earnings between Billy and Sally is: $230 - $210 = $20.

So, Billy will earn $20 more than Sally."
"To find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels, we need to calculate the total cost of each and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of 3 loaves of bread:
- Each loaf of bread costs $2.
- Therefore, 3 loaves of bread cost \(3 \times 2 = 6\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of 2 bagels:
- Each bagel costs $1.
- Therefore, 2 bagels cost \(2 \times 1 = 2\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference between the cost of 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels:
- The difference is \(6 - 2 = 4\) dollars.

So, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels."
"First, let's calculate how many points Nikita scored. We know that Nikita scored 11 more than half as many points as Pierson. Pierson scored 278 points.

Half of Pierson's points is:
\[ \frac{278}{2} = 139 \]

Nikita scored 11 more than this amount:
\[ 139 + 11 = 150 \]

Now, to find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we add their scores together:
\[ 278 + 150 = 428 \]

Therefore, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is:
428"
"To calculate the total number of trees planted, we need to consider both the students and the teachers' contributions.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students:
- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has 25 students.
- Therefore, the total number of students is \(40 \times 25 = 1000\).
- Each student plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by students is \(1000 \times 1 = 1000\).

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has 3 teachers.
- Therefore, the total number of teachers is \(40 \times 3 = 120\).
- Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by teachers is \(120 \times 2 = 240\).

Finally, we add the number of trees planted by students and teachers to get the total number of trees planted:
- Total trees = Trees planted by students + Trees planted by teachers
- Total trees = \(1000 + 240 = 1240\).

Therefore, at the end of the campaign, they will have planted 1240 trees."
"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total current stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

Final numerical answer:

"Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, so:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \text{ hour/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:

\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the hours from both periods:

\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. To find out how many more hours she needs to play:

\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. Calculate the distance traveled by the first car in 2 hours:
   - Speed of the first car: 60 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 2 hours = 120 miles

2. Calculate the distance traveled by the second car in 2 hours:
   - Speed of the second car: 70 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 70 miles/hour × 2 hours = 140 miles

3. Find the difference in distance between the two cars after 2 hours:
   - Distance between the cars = Distance traveled by the second car - Distance traveled by the first car
   - Distance between the cars = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

20 miles"
"To find out how much James paid for the ring, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the materials (diamond and gold).
2. Calculate the 30% premium on the total cost of the materials.
3. Add the premium to the total cost of the materials to get the final amount James paid.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the materials.
The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300.
Total cost of materials = $600 + $300 = $900

Step 2: Calculate the 30% premium.
30% of $900 = 0.30 * $900 = $270

Step 3: Add the premium to the total cost of the materials.
Final amount paid = Total cost of materials + Premium
Final amount paid = $900 + $270 = $1170

Therefore, James paid $1170 for the ring."
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students, then divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students.

First, let's calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders, so it's \(2 \times \frac{40}{100} = \frac{80}{100} = 0.8\). Therefore, 400 fifth-graders had \(400 \times 0.8 = 320\) pass.

Now, let's sum up the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total students who passed: \(340 + 40 + 320 = 680\)
- Total students: \(500 + 100 + 400 = 1000\)

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students:

\[
\text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{680}{1000} = 0.68
\]

Expressing this as a percentage:

\[
0.68 \times 100 = 68\%
\]

The school's overall pass rate is 68%."
"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of the mosaic he can make with the total number of chips.
3. Calculate the length of the mosaic given its height.

First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has in total. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, we multiply:

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12:

\[ 144 \text{ chips} \div 12 \text{ chips/square inch} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Now, we know the mosaic will be 3 inches tall. To find the length of the mosaic, we divide the total area by the height:

\[ 12 \text{ square inches} \div 3 \text{ inches} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of the mosaic Milo can make is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find out how many gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party, we need to first calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students and then add the remaining tea to find the initial amount.

1. Calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the four students:
   - Each of the four students drank 1.5 quarts.
   - Total for four students: \(4 \times 1.5 = 6\) quarts.

2. Calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the sixteen students:
   - Each of the sixteen students drank 2 quarts.
   - Total for sixteen students: \(16 \times 2 = 32\) quarts.

   - Initial amount: \(38 + 10 = 48\) quarts.

5. Convert the initial amount from quarts to gallons (since there are 4 quarts in a gallon):
   - Initial amount in gallons: \(48 \div 4 = 12\) gallons.

Final numerical answer:
12 gallons"
"Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 butterscotch candies, which means he needed to order more to meet the demand. He then ordered 100 more candies. 

To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and then subtract the number of candies he has already sold.

Total candies Dale has = Initial candies + Additional candies ordered
Total candies Dale has = 100 + 100 = 200

Candies already sold = 150

Candies still to be sold = Total candies - Candies already sold
Candies still to be sold = 200 - 150 = 50

Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month, starting from the beginning of the year, and then find the difference between the number of students at the end of May and the initial number of students.

1. **Beginning of the year (January):** 10 students
2. **End of January:** The number of students doubles, so \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
3. **End of February:** The number of students doubles again, so \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
4. **End of March:** The number of students doubles again, so \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
5. **End of April:** The number of students doubles again, so \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
6. **End of May:** The number of students doubles again, so \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

Now, we need to find the additional students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year.

The number of students at the beginning of the year is 10, and at the end of May, it is 320. The additional students are:

\[320 - 10 = 310\]

So, the additional students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. During the week, he made $105. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25} = 420 \]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \]

Therefore, on average, Felix climbed 60 branches per day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picked:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\]

Next, we account for the flowers that are dropped. She drops 1 of each type of flower:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\]

Subtracting the petals of the dropped flowers from the initial total gives:
\[101 - 22 = 79\]

Therefore, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:

"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they make:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ S'mores} \]

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they used 18 marshmallows to make the S'mores. Additionally, they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. So, the total number of marshmallows that are no longer available is:

\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ marshmallows} \]

The original number of marshmallows in the bag was 35. After using and dropping some, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is:

\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Since John and DeSean are sharing the remaining marshmallows equally, each of them can have:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Therefore, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Jack's Game Time:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
   - They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.
   - Jack's total game time is 240 minutes.
   - The number of quarters Jack uses is \( \frac{240}{20} = 12 \) quarters.

2. **Friends' Game Times:**
   - Two friends can play half as long as Jack, so they can play for \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) minutes per quarter.
   - The better friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for \( 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \) minutes per quarter.
   - The total game time for the two friends who play half as long as Jack is \( 2 \times 10 \times 4 = 80 \) minutes.

"Let's denote the amount of citrus zest used as \( z \) ounces. Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.

The amount of salt used is \( s \) ounces. Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.

The amount of oil used is \( 2s \) ounces because it is twice the amount of salt.

According to the problem, the amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so we have:
\[ s = 2z \]

The total amount of ingredients used is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total amount of ingredients as:
\[ s + s + z + z + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 4s + 2z = 10 \]

Substituting \( s = 2z \) into the equation:
\[ 4(2z) + 2z = 10 \]
\[ 8z + 2z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find \( s \):
\[ s = 2z = 2 \times 1 = 2 \]

The amount of oil used is \( 2s \):
\[ 2s = 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil used is 4 ounces.

"To find out how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows, then add these two amounts together.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John bought 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John bought 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the overall amount spent:
- Total cost of goats: $1500
- Total cost of cows: $3000
- Therefore, the total amount spent is \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"First, let's determine how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. So, the number of cars he gives away is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of cars Joe has sold and given away:

\[ 8 + 16 = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Finally, to find out how many cars Joe remains with, we subtract the total number of cars sold and given away from the initial number of cars Joe had:

\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Joe remains with 16 cars after selling and giving some to his mother."
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to follow these steps:

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have:
\[ \text{Smendrick's cards} = 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \]
\[ \text{Becca's cards} = 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.
3. She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs:

- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

Total number of eggs = \(5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27\)

Therefore, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the refund she will receive and the cost of the shipping, then find the difference between the two.

1. **Calculate the refund amount:**
   - The book's purchase price is $32.
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price.
   - Refund amount = $32 * 0.75 = $24.

2. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds.
   - The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
   - Shipping cost for weight = 4 * $0.35 = $1.40.
   - The book needs to be returned 20 miles away.
   - The shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
   - Shipping cost for distance = 20 * $0.08 = $1.60.
   - Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - Net loss = Purchase price - Refund amount + Shipping cost.
   - Net loss = $32 - $24 + $3 = $11.

Therefore, Milly will lose $11."
"Mulan starts with $40 and her father gives her an additional $100, so she has:

\[ 40 + 100 = 140 \]

She then buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, which costs:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

And she buys a bag for $20. The total cost of her purchases is:

\[ 60 + 20 = 80 \]

Subtracting the total cost of her purchases from her initial amount, we get:

\[ 140 - 80 = 60 \]

So, Mulan has \(\boxed{60}\) dollars left."
"Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. Let's break down the production for each week:

- First week: 8,000 bars
- Second week: Half of the first week, which is \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars
- Third week: Three times the first week, which is \( 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \) bars

Now, let's calculate the total production for the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars} \]

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, the production for the fourth week is:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars} \]

Therefore, the production for the fourth week is 14,000 bars."
"To determine how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on each activity and then sum these times for a month with four weeks.

1. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - In a month with four weeks, she spends \(2 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 8 \text{ hours}\).

2. **Time spent doing makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - In a week, she spends \(15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 90 \text{ minutes/week}\).
   - Converting minutes to hours, \(90 \text{ minutes} = 1.5 \text{ hours}\).
   - In a month with four weeks, she spends \(1.5 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 6 \text{ hours}\).

3. **Time spent recording videos:**
   - Britany records 18 4-minute videos each week.
   - The total time spent recording videos each week is \(18 \text{ videos/week} \times 4 \text{ minutes/video} = 72 \text{ minutes/week}\).
   - Converting minutes to hours, \(72 \text{ minutes} = 1.2 \text{ hours}\).
   - In a month with four weeks, she spends \(1.2 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 4.8 \text{ hours}\).

4. **Total time spent on TikTok in a month:**
   - Adding up all the time spent on each activity, we get \(8 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 4.8 \text{ hours} = 18.8 \text{ hours}\).

Therefore, Britany spends a total of 18.8 hours on TikTok in a month with four weeks."
"To calculate the total cost for Angela, we need to break down the charges based on the information provided.

1. **Base Installation Cost**: The base cost for hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures is $129.00.

2. **Additional Items**:
   - Angela needs 6 mirrors, but the base cost already includes 4 mirrors. So, she needs 2 additional mirrors.
   - She needs 2 chandeliers, but the base cost already includes 1 chandelier. So, she needs 1 additional chandelier.
   - She needs 20 pictures, but the base cost already includes 10 pictures. So, she needs 10 additional pictures.

"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Anthony has saved.
2. Use Anthony's savings to find out how much Roy has saved.

First, we know that Eva has saved $20.00. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so:
\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings:
\[ 40\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Roy's savings are:
\[ \text{Roy's savings} = 30 + 12 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Roy has is:
\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to work through the relationships step by step.

1. **Pompei's lifting capacity**: Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.

2. **Saskay's lifting capacity**: Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. Therefore, Saskay can lift:
   \[
   12 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Kagiyami's lifting capacity**: Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. Therefore, Kagiyami can lift:
   \[
   4 \times 12 \text{ inches} = 48 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Naruto's lifting capacity**: Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. Therefore, Naruto can lift:
   \[
   10 \times 48 \text{ inches} = 480 \text{ inches}
   \]

5. **Convert inches to feet**: Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 480 inches to feet:
   \[
   \frac{480 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 40 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for four turtles to travel the same distance as the kangaroos, given their different speeds.

First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel a certain distance, we can calculate the speed of one kangaroo as follows:

Let the distance be \( D \) and the speed of one kangaroo be \( S \).

Since speed is distance divided by time, we have:
\[ S = \frac{D}{18 \text{ hours}} \]

Now, the speed of one turtle is half the speed of a kangaroo:
\[ \text{Speed of one turtle} = \frac{S}{2} = \frac{D}{36 \text{ hours}} \]

Since the four turtles are traveling at the same speed, the total speed of the four turtles combined is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{D}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{4D}{36 \text{ hours}} = \frac{D}{9 \text{ hours}} \]

Now, we need to find the time it takes for the four turtles to travel the distance \( D \). Using the formula for time, which is distance divided by speed, we get:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{9 \text{ hours}}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take the four turtles 9 hours to travel across the highway.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of dishes Kora made:**
   Kora made 20 dishes.

2. **Calculate the number of dishes Rory made:**
   Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora. So, Rory made \(20 + 20 = 40\) dishes.

3. **Calculate the number of dishes Jada made:**
   Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory. So, Jada made \(2 \times 40 = 80\) dishes.

4. **Calculate the total number of dishes made by all three:**
   The total number of dishes is the sum of the dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora.
   \[
   80 + 40 + 20 = 140

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes they all make together is 140."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The original price of the new laptop is $600.
2. By trading in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, making the new price $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she currently has $400 - $50 = $350.
4. Erika has been paid $150 this week and her mom gave her $80. So, the total amount from these sources is $150 + $80 = $230.
5. Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is $350 - $230 = $120.

So, Erika has $120 in her purse."
"First, let's calculate the total number of apple slices Adam gets from slicing the apples.

- From 3 large apples, he gets \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices.
- From 5 small apples, he gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.

So, the total number of slices is \(15 + 15 = 30\).

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is \(30 - 15 = 15\).

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is 15."
"The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk a day from one cow. Therefore, with 3 cows, he extracts:

\[ 5 \, \text{liters/cow} \times 3 \, \text{cows} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, he needs:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters a day, the number of additional cows needed is:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day."
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and then sum these lengths.

1. The first glue stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left, so it has \( 1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6} \) not used. Since each glue stick is 12 millimeters long, the unused length of the first glue stick is \( 12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \) millimeters.

2. The second glue stick has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left, so it has \( 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \) not used. The unused length of the second glue stick is \( 12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \) millimeters.

3. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left, so it has \( 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \) not used. The unused length of the third glue stick is \( 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \) millimeters.

Adding these unused lengths together, we get:
\[ 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \]

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 millimeters."

3 * $3 = $9

The total amount spent is the sum of the cost of the squirt guns and the water balloons:

$12 + $9 = $21

To find out how much money Craig has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money he had:

$40 - $21 = $19

Therefore, Craig has $19 left."
"Given:
- Jack collected 60 dishes.
- Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) socks.
- Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
- Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
- Jack's total: \( 30 \) socks + \( 60 \) dishes = \( 90 \)
- Peter's total: \( 60 \) socks + \( 30 \) dishes = \( 90 \)

Adding both totals together:

"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years with simple interest, we first need to understand the interest rate and how it applies to the principal amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year. Since the original amount is $300, the interest rate per year is:

\[ \text{Interest Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\% \]

However, an interest rate of 225% per year is quite high and typically would be expressed as a decimal. Converting 225% to a decimal gives us:

\[ \text{Interest Rate (as a decimal)} = 2.25 \]

Simple interest is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal is $300, the rate is 2.25, and the time is 3 years. Plugging these values into the formula gives:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 \]

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 6.75 \]

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 2025 \]

The total amount after 3 years is the sum of the principal and the simple interest:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 2025 \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 2325 \]

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $2325."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total white shirts and collars:**
   - The store has 40 white shirts.
   - Half of the white shirts have collars, so \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) white shirts have collars.
   - Therefore, the number of white shirts with no collars is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

2. **Total floral shirts and buttons:**
   - The store has 50 floral shirts.
   - 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.
   - Therefore, the number of floral shirts with no buttons is \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

3. **Comparing the numbers:**
   - We need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars.
   - The number of floral shirts with no buttons is 30.
   - The number of white shirts with no collars is 20.
   - The difference is \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

Therefore, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars."
"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we first need to determine how many trays he can fill with 900 eggs, given that each tray holds 30 eggs.

\[ \text{Number of trays} = \frac{\text{Total number of eggs}}{\text{Eggs per tray}} = \frac{900}{30} = 30 \]

Now, if he sells each tray for $2.5, the total earnings will be:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of trays} \times \text{Price per tray} = 30 \times 2.5 = 75 \]

The farmer will earn $75."
"Initially, Mr. Smith has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y.

He sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is:
55 - 10 = 45 goats

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X, which means he sold:
2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y

So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
45 - 20 = 25 goats

Altogether, the number of goats left in the two farms is:
45 (from Farm X) + 25 (from Farm Y) = 70 goats

70 goats"
"James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month. There are 12 months in a year, so he buys:

\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

He spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find out how much he pays on average for each pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the number of pairs:

\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, on average, James pays $110 for each pair of shoes."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food.
2. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount applied.
3. Add the two amounts to get the total cost.

Step 1: Cost of 3 baskets of green food
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- Therefore, 3 baskets of green food cost \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

Step 2: Cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount
- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- With a $2 discount for each basket, the cost per basket of red food is \(18 - 2 = 16\) dollars.
- Therefore, 3 baskets of red food cost \(3 \times 16 = 48\) dollars.

Step 3: Total cost
- The total cost is the sum of the cost of the green food and the red food.
- Total cost = \(75 + 48 = 123\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount you will have to pay is $123."

"Let's define the variables for the ages:
- Let \( B \) be the age of your brother.
- Let \( I \) be your age.
- Let \( S \) be the age of your sister.
- Let \( M \) be the age of your mom.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( I = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( I = S + 2 \) or \( S = I - 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( I + B + S + M = 87 \).

Substituting the expressions for \( I \), \( S \), and \( M \) in terms of \( B \) into the sum equation, we get:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 3 - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]
Simplify the equation:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]
Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]
Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, we can find your age \( I \):
\[ I = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

So, you are 13 years old."
"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.
2. Determine how many packs are required to meet this need, considering he can only buy whole packs and wants to have some extra glue sticks.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.**

Mr. Jackson has 27 students and wants to give each student 2 glue sticks.
\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks per student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many packs are required.**

Glue sticks come in packs of 8. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack.
\[ 54 \div 8 = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. This means he needs 7 packs to ensure he has enough glue sticks.

**Step 3: Verify the total number of glue sticks with 7 packs.**

\[ 7 \text{ packs} \times 8 \text{ glue sticks per pack} = 56 \text{ glue sticks} \]

With 56 glue sticks, he will have 2 extra glue sticks, which satisfies the condition of having some extra glue sticks left over.

**Final Answer:**
Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks."
"On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles, so the new amount is:
\[ 4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons} \]

On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day is:
\[ 8000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 14000 \text{ gallons} \]

The total amount of water passing through the river at that point on the third day is:

- Total infected: \(70 + 420 = 490\)

**Day 3:**
- Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections: \(490 \times 6 = 2940\)
- Total infected: \(490 + 2940 = 3430\)

After three days, the total number of infected people is 3430."
"Rafaela received a $20 tip from each of the forty customers, so the total amount of tips she received is:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \text{ dollars} \]

Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find out how much less, we calculate 10% of $800:

\[ 10\% \times 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Julieta received:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their individual amounts:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of tips received by Julieta and Rafaela altogether is:

\[ 1520 \text{ dollars} \]"
"Jennifer initially bought 12 oranges.

She gave 2 oranges to each of her three daughters, which totals:
2 oranges/daughter × 3 daughters = 6 oranges

She also gave 3 oranges to her son.

So, the total number of oranges given away is:
6 oranges (to daughters) + 3 oranges (to son) = 9 oranges

Therefore, the number of oranges Jennifer remained with is:
12 oranges (initially bought) - 9 oranges (given away) = 3 oranges

Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"Claire earns 1 badge every month. In a year, which has 12 months, Claire will earn:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so in the same 12 months, Amber will earn:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ badges}}{2} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so in 12 months, Wendy will earn:
\[ 12 \text{ badges} \times 3 = 36 \text{ badges} \]

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1 year time frame, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:
\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame."
"Paige bakes from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours. 

In one hour, she can bake 2 banana bread loaves. Therefore, in 5 hours, she bakes:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. Therefore, the total amount raised is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times \$0.50/\text{slice} = \$40.00 \]

Paige raised \(\boxed{40}\) dollars."
"If Gretchen has 70 gold coins and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, then she has:

70 - 30 = 40 silver coins.

70 (gold coins) + 40 (silver coins) = 110 coins.

Gretchen had a total of 110 coins."
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students.
2. Add the number of burritos Mr. George ate.
3. Subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students.
- There are 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos.
- Total burritos for students = 50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos.

Step 2: Add the number of burritos Mr. George ate.
- Mr. George ate 20 burritos.

Step 3: Subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered.
- Initial number of burritos = 600.
- Total burritos consumed = 500 (students) + 20 (Mr. George) = 520.
- Leftover burritos = 600 - 520 = 80.

Therefore, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 80."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. There are 12 red cars.
2. There are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so there are \(12 - 2 = 10\) green cars.
3. There are 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so there are \(3 \times 10 = 30\) blue cars.

Now, let's add up the red, green, and blue cars:
\[12 + 10 + 30 = 52\]

The total number of cars in the rink is 75. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:
\[75 - 52 = 23\]

Therefore, the number of yellow cars is \(\boxed{23}\)."
"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as \( F \), Anne has as \( A \), and Sofie has as \( S \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \)
2. \( S = A + 25 \)
3. \( A = F - 12 \)

First, we can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation to find \( F \).

From the third equation, we can express \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ A = F - 12 \]

From the second equation, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( A \):
\[ S = A + 25 \]
Substituting \( A = F - 12 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \]

Now, we substitute \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \( 28 \) books.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{28} \]"

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots."
"To determine how much Greg will spend on jello, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.
2. Determine how many boxes of jello are required.
3. Calculate the total cost.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.**

Greg wants each of the 30 kids to have 4 jello cups. So, the total number of jello cups needed is:
\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups per kid} = 120 \text{ cups} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many boxes of jello are required.**

Each box makes 10 small jello cups. To find out how many boxes are needed to make 120 cups, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups per box:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost.**

Each box of jello costs $1.25. Therefore, the total cost for 12 boxes is:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

So, Greg will spend \(\boxed{15}\) dollars on jello."
"To find out how much change the seller will give back, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 5 phones.

The cost of one phone is $700, so the total cost for 5 phones is:
\[ 5 \times 700 = 3500 \]

The seller gives $4000. To find the change, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given:
\[ 4000 - 3500 = 500 \]

So, the seller will give back $500 in change."
"To determine how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to calculate the total amount each person pays per month and then divide that by 4 to find the weekly amount.

1. Calculate the total amount Madeline pays per month:
   - Madeline pays 60% of the total cost.
   - Total cost per month = $400.
   - Amount Madeline pays = 60% of $400 = 0.60 * $400 = $240.

2. Calculate the total amount Keenan pays per month:
   - Since the total cost is $400 and Madeline pays $240, Keenan pays the remaining amount.
   - Amount Keenan pays = Total cost - Amount Madeline pays = $400 - $240 = $160.

3. Calculate the amount Keenan spends per week:
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Amount Keenan spends per week = Amount Keenan pays per month / 4 = $160 / 4 = $40.

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total pieces of pizza**: 60

2. **Pieces eaten on the first day**: \( \frac{2}{5} \) of 60
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24
   \]
   So, Tobias ate 24 pieces on the first day.

3. **Remaining pieces after the first day**: 
   \[
   60 - 24 = 36
   \]

4. **Pieces eaten on the second day**: 10 pieces
   \[
   36 - 10 = 26
   \]
   So, 26 pieces remain after the second day.

5. **Pieces eaten on the third day**: \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining 26 pieces
   \[
   \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14
   \]
   So, Tobias ate 14 pieces on the third day.

6. **Total pieces eaten so far**: 
   \[
   24 + 10 + 14 = 48
   \]

Therefore, Tobias has eaten 48 pieces of pizza so far."
"To find out how much David will spend, we first need to determine the cost per bottle for both soda and water.

1. **Cost per bottle of soda:**
   - 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00.
   - Cost per bottle of soda = $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

2. **Cost per bottle of water:**
   - 4 bottles of water cost $8.00.
   - Cost per bottle of water = $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, we calculate the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.

3. **Total cost for soda:**
   - 3 bottles of soda at $3.00 each = 3 * $3.00 = $9.00.

4. **Total cost for water:**
   - 2 bottles of water at $2.00 each = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

5. **Total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:**

"To find out how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 16 bolts.
2. Subtract the total cost from David's initial amount of money.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of 16 bolts.
Each bolt costs $0.03, so the total cost for 16 bolts is:
\[ 16 \times 0.03 = 0.48 \]

Step 2: Subtract the total cost from David's initial amount of money.
David initially has $12.48. After spending $0.48 on the bolts, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, the amount of money David has left after paying for the bolts is $12.00."
"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours of dog walking, we first need to determine her hourly rate.

Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of work. So, her hourly rate is:
\[ \text{Hourly Rate} = \frac{\$33}{3 \text{ hours}} = \$11 \text{ per hour} \]

Now, to find out how much she would earn after 12 hours, we multiply her hourly rate by 12:
\[ \text{Earnings after 12 hours} = \$11 \times 12 = \$132 \]

"To determine how much Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Subtract the profit from the total revenue to find the total cost of the chickens.

First, calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell:
\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \]

Next, calculate the total revenue from selling these chickens:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, so the total cost of the chickens is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Profit} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Isaias bought the chickens for is:
\[ \boxed{7000} \]"
"Julie sold 14 glasses of lemonade. The total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32. Since the boys (Micah and Mitchell) sold an equal number of glasses, we can find out how many glasses Micah sold by first determining how many glasses the boys sold in total.

The total number of glasses sold by Julie and the boys is 32. Subtracting the 14 glasses sold by Julie, we get:
32 - 14 = 18 glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell together.

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide 18 by 2 to find out how many glasses each of them sold:
18 / 2 = 9 glasses sold by Micah.

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold:
14 - 9 = 5.

Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"First, let's calculate how much money Sarah will earn from selling the rope. The rope is 20 meters long, and she can sell it for $2 per meter.

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 20 \, \text{meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and we need to know how many meters of the new rope Sarah plans to buy. Since the problem does not specify the length of the new rope, we'll assume she wants to buy a rope of the same length as the one she sold, which is 20 meters.

\[ \text{Cost of new rope} = 20 \, \text{meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$30 \]

Now, we can find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope.

\[ \text{Money left over} = \text{Total earnings} - \text{Cost of new rope} = \$40 - \$30 = \$10 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Sarah will have left over after she buys the new rope is:

\[ \$10 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age. If in 10 years she will be 18 years old, then her current age is:

\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Three times her current age is:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Let's denote the number of years from now when her age will be 24 as \( x \). Therefore, in \( x \) years, her age will be:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item category:

1. **Bacon**: Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total. So, the cost per pack of bacon is:
   \[
   \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]

2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. Therefore, the cost per packet of chicken is:
   \[
   2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet}
   \]
   Since she has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost for chicken is:
   \[
   6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4. Since she has 3 packs, the total cost for strawberries is:
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Apples**: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. Therefore, the cost per pack of apples is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]
   Since she has 7 packs of apples, the total cost for apples is:
   \[
   7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's sum up the total cost of all the items:
\[
10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. Therefore, the amount of money she has left in her budget is:
\[
65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the usual length of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, plus a 15-minute encore, and the total runtime is 65 minutes. We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes.

"First, we need to determine how many microphones will not find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. Given that 20% of the 50 microphones won't fit, we calculate:

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 microphones

This means 10 microphones will not be paired. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be paired is:

50 - 10 = 40 microphones

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:

40 / 2 = 20 pairs

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage."

"First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids and the daisies.

For the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals on the orchids is \(5 \times 5 = 25\).

For the daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals on the daisies is \(4 \times 10 = 40\).

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of orchid petals from the total number of daisy petals:
- The difference in the number of petals is \(40 - 25 = 15\).

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids."
"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants:

\[ \text{Outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. To find the number of flowering plants, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, 25% of the plants are flowering plants."
"To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to first determine the speed of the thingamabob and then use that to find the speed of the whirligig.

1. We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the thingamabob can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ m/s}}{11} = 11 \text{ m/s} \]

2. A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the whirligig can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ m/s} = 55 \text{ m/s} \]

The whirligig spins at 55 meters per second."

We know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for each mowing. Therefore, the total amount Tasha earned from mowing Joe's lawn is \( 6J \), from Kamala's lawn is \( 6 \times 3J = 18J \), and from Alba's lawn is \( 6A \).

The total earnings from mowing lawns is the sum of the earnings from each lawn:
\[ 6J + 18J + 6A = 24J + 6A \]

We also know that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Therefore, the earnings from lemonade sales plus the earnings from mowing lawns equals $80:
\[ \text{Earnings from lemonade} + 24J + 6A = 80 \]

Since the problem does not provide the exact number of times Tasha mowed Alba's lawn, we can assume that the earnings from mowing Alba's lawn are not specified and can be considered as part of the total earnings from mowing lawns. However, we can still solve for the earnings from lemonade sales by isolating it in the equation:
\[ \text{Earnings from lemonade} = 80 - (24J + 6A) \]

Given that the problem does not specify the exact number of times Tasha mowed Alba's lawn, we can assume that the earnings from mowing Alba's lawn are not contributing to the final numerical answer for the lemonade sales. Therefore, we can simplify the problem by focusing on the known earnings from mowing Joe's and Kamala's lawns.

"To calculate John's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out each month.
2. Calculate his total earnings from renting the car.
3. Subtract his car payment from his total earnings to find his profit.

Step 1: Total number of hours rented out each month
John rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time.
\[ 10 \text{ times} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Step 2: Total earnings
John gets paid $25 an hour.
\[ 30 \text{ hours} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$750 \]

Step 3: Calculate profit
Subtract the car payment from the total earnings.

"First, let's determine how many notebooks Martha originally had. Since Martha ended up with 7 notebooks after buying 5 more, she originally had:

\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

Now, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. So, Joseph had:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

"Dijana rowed for 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, which means Anis rowed an additional \(50 \times \frac{1}{5} = 10\) miles. Therefore, Anis rowed \(50 + 10 = 60\) miles.

The total distance both of them rowed is the sum of the distances each rowed, which is \(50 + 60 = 110\) miles.

Total distance rowed: 110 miles."
"Susan originally made 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies for himself, leaving 96 cookies to be divided among her 6 nephews.

"Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages.

Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.

So, the total number of pages Denise read is \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.

Daniel did not read any pages today, so his total remains \(13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract Daniel's total from Denise's total: \(28 - 13 = 15\).

Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the total amount of soup Calvin has in terms of bowls.

Calvin's pot can fill:
- 4 adult bowls
- 8 child bowls

Since Calvin and his wife are both adults, they will each have 1 adult bowl, which totals 2 adult bowls for the adults. This leaves us with 2 adult bowls worth of soup for the children (since 4 total adult bowls - 2 adult bowls for Calvin and his wife = 2 adult bowls for the children).

Each adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls (since 4 adult bowls = 8 child bowls, so 1 adult bowl = 2 child bowls).

Therefore, the 2 adult bowls for the children are equivalent to:
2 adult bowls * 2 child bowls/adult bowl = 4 child bowls

Calvin has 4 child bowls of soup left after the adults have eaten. There are 2 children, so we divide the remaining soup by the number of children:
4 child bowls / 2 children = 2 child bowls per child

Each child will be able to have 2 bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

Each child will be able to have 2 bowls of soup for lunch."

"To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, let's calculate the material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, to find out how much material is needed for 1 small mask, we divide 2 yards by 4:
  \[
  \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask}
  \]
- To find out how much material is needed for 20 small masks, we multiply the material needed for 1 small mask by 20:
  \[
  0.5 \text{ yards/mask} \times 20 \text{ masks} = 10 \text{ yards}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, to find out how much material is needed for 1 large mask, we divide 2.25 yards by 3:
  \[
  \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask}
  \]
- To find out how much material is needed for 8 large masks, we multiply the material needed for 1 large mask by 8:
  \[
  0.75 \text{ yards/mask} \times 8 \text{ masks} = 6 \text{ yards}
  \]

Finally, we add the material needed for the small and large masks together:
\[
10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards}
\]

Therefore, Jo would need \(\boxed{16}\) yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tickets Deepa has seen.
2. Divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets to find the average price per ticket.

First, we calculate the total number of tickets:
- There are 9 movies.
- She has seen each movie 3 times.
- Therefore, the total number of tickets is \(9 \times 3 = 27\).

Next, we calculate the average price per ticket:
- She spent $216 in total.
- The total number of tickets is 27.
- The average price per ticket is \(\frac{216}{27} = 8\).

So, the average price she paid per ticket is $8."
"To find out how much free time Harold has, we need to calculate the total hours he spends on his activities and subtract that from the total hours in a day.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up the time spent on these activities:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Walk: 1 hour

Total time spent on activities = 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours

There are 24 hours in a day. So, the free time Harold has is:
24 - 19 = 5 hours

Therefore, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day."
"Tim starts with 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes.

He uses 3 blue shoe boxes for fishing, so the number of blue shoe boxes left is:
7 - 3 = 4 blue shoe boxes.

He uses 1/3 of his red shoe boxes for fishing, so the number of red shoe boxes used is:
1/3 * 9 = 3 red shoe boxes.

Therefore, the number of red shoe boxes left is:
9 - 3 = 6 red shoe boxes.

So, the total number of shoe boxes left in Tim's box is:
4 blue + 6 red = 10 shoe boxes.

Final numerical answer:
10 shoe boxes."

"To solve this problem, let's first set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( D \) be Duncan's current age and \( A \) be Adam's current age.

From the problem, we know:
- Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).
- Duncan's age eight years ago was \( D - 8 \).
- Adam's age four years ago was \( A - 4 \).
- Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, so we can write the equation: \( D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \).

Now, substitute \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years."

\[ 40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Now, we calculate how much money he earns. Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, we multiply the number of packages by his pay rate:

\[ 320 \text{ packages} \times \$0.20/\text{package} = \$64.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku:**
   - A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes.
   - An extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, so:
     \[
     45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Calculate how many bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes:**
   - John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, which is 30 minutes.
   - To find out how many 30-minute intervals are in 180 minutes, we divide 180 by 30:
     \[
     \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes per bottle}} = 6 \text{ bottles}
     \]

Therefore, John drinks 6 bottles of water in the time it takes him to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle."
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( R \) as the number of red balloons.
- \( Y \) as the number of yellow balloons.

From the problem, we know:
- Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
- Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
- There are 20 red balloons.

First, we can calculate the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons:
\[ 2 \text{ pieces/balloon} \times 20 \text{ red balloons} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

This means the remaining bologna pieces were thrown at the yellow balloons:
\[ 58 \text{ total pieces} - 40 \text{ pieces for red balloons} = 18 \text{ pieces for yellow balloons} \]

Since each yellow balloon received 3 pieces of bologna, we can find the number of yellow balloons by dividing the total bologna pieces for yellow balloons by 3:
\[ Y = \frac{18 \text{ pieces}}{3 \text{ pieces/balloon}} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

Therefore, the number of yellow balloons is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, which totals:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the interval for a tune-up:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time."
"Bruce works 5 hours on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which is \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

To find the total hours Bruce works over these three days, we add the hours from each day together:

\(5 + 10 + 8 = 23\)

Bruce works a total of 23 hours in all these three days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: Since 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, we can calculate the cost as follows:
   - Cost for 2 balloons = $0.5
   - Cost for 1 balloon = $0.5 / 2 = $0.25
   - Cost for 12 balloons = $0.25 * 12 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each = $7 * 2 = $14

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to cover these expenses, the total amount they had together is $28. Since they had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total by 2 to find out how much each girl received from their mother.

- Allowance per girl = Total amount / 2
- Allowance per girl = $28 / 2 = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14."

"First, let's determine the number of students playing tennis and volleyball. There are 6 students playing tennis. Since there are twice as many students playing volleyball, we calculate the number of volleyball players as follows:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

Next, we add the number of students playing tennis and volleyball to find the total number of students in these two sports:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

Now, we add the number of students playing soccer. There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so the total number of soccer players is:

\[ 16 + 22 = 38 \]

Finally, we add the number of students playing tennis and volleyball to the number of students playing soccer to find the total number of students:

\[ 18 + 38 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total number of students is:

\[ 56 \]"
"To calculate the profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Step 1: Total number of lollipops sold
- Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops.
- Total lollipops sold = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops

Step 2: Total revenue
- Each lollipop was sold for $0.8.
- Total revenue = 300 lollipops * $0.8/lollipop = $240

Step 3: Total cost
- Each lollipop was bought for $0.5.
- Total cost = 300 lollipops * $0.5/lollipop = $150

Step 4: Profit
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $240 - $150 = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(7 \times 3 = 21\) fish.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(21 \div 3 = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:

- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\).

Therefore, Larry has 47 pets."
"Abby eats 2 slices of bread per day. Josh eats twice as much as Abby, which means Josh eats 4 slices of bread per day.

Together, they eat \(2 + 4 = 6\) slices of bread per day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices.

To find out how many days the loaf will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat per day:

\[
\frac{24 \text{ slices}}{6 \text{ slices/day}} = 4 \text{ days}
\]

The loaf of bread will last for 4 days."
"Martha started collecting shells when she was 5 years old and continued until her 10th birthday. This means she collected shells for 10 - 5 = 5 years. Since she collects one shell every month, we need to calculate the total number of months in 5 years.

There are 12 months in a year, so in 5 years, there are 5 * 12 = 60 months.

Therefore, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected 60 shells.

60 shells"
"Lana has 27 cups of tea in total. She divides these into 3 rows, so each row has:

\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. This means that in each row, the 9 cups are split equally between chamomile and mint tea. Therefore, the number of mint tea cups in each row is:

\[ \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \]

So, the number of mint tea cups in each row is 4.5.

4.5"
"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to first calculate how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours.

Given that it takes the sloth 4 hours to make one round trip (down to the ground and back up), we can calculate the number of trips in 8 hours as follows:

\[ \text{Number of trips} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Now, if the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 2 trips, we can find the number of berries picked per trip by dividing the total number of berries by the number of trips:

\[ \text{Berries per trip} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground to collect 24 berries in 8 hours is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much water is in the tank after Anthony and his father fill it. The tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons of water.

\[ \text{Water in the tank} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water is used from the tank over 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day.

\[ \text{Water used in 6 days} = 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank to find out how much water remains.

\[ \text{Water remaining in the tank} = 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the expenses he has already made and the expenses for the current day.

1. **Initial Monthly Budget**: $150
2. **Expenses so far**:
   - Movies on Fridays and Saturdays: $10 each
   - Movies on other days: $7 each
   - Popcorn: $8 per tub
   - Candy: $2 per box

3. **Expenses for the current day (Friday)**:
   - Popcorn: $8
   - Candy: $2
   - Total for current day: $8 + $2 = $10

4. **Total expenses so far**:
   - Movies on Fridays and Saturdays: 5 movies * $10 = $50
   - Movies on other days: 8 movies * $7 = $56
   - Popcorn: 2 tubs * $8 = $16
   - Candy: 4 boxes * $2 = $8
   - Total expenses so far: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $120

5. **Remaining budget**:
   - Initial budget: $150
   - Total expenses so far: $120
   - Remaining budget: $150 - $120 = $30

6. **Cost of a movie on a Friday or Saturday**:
   - $10

7. **Number of movies he can see with the remaining budget**:
   - Remaining budget: $30
   - Cost per movie: $10
   - Number of movies: $30 / $10 = 3

Therefore, Colby can see 3 more movies if he already saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, 8 movies on other days, had 2 tubs of popcorn, and four boxes of candy that month.

"To find the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the calories in one mini cinnamon roll.
2. Calculate the total calories for all mini cinnamon rolls.
3. Calculate the calories in one mini blueberry muffin.
4. Calculate the total calories for all mini blueberry muffins.
5. Add the total calories from both types of pastries.

First, we know that a normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that. So, the calories in one mini cinnamon roll are:
\[ \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we calculate the total calories for all 200 mini cinnamon rolls:
\[ 200 \text{ rolls} \times 200 \text{ calories/roll} = 40,000 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we know that a normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that. So, the calories in one mini blueberry muffin are:
\[ \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we calculate the total calories for all 300 mini blueberry muffins:
\[ 300 \text{ muffins} \times 150 \text{ calories/muffin} = 45,000 \text{ calories} \]

Finally, we add the total calories from both types of pastries:
\[ 40,000 \text{ calories} + 45,000 \text{ calories} = 85,000 \text{ calories} \]

Therefore, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is:
\[ 85,000 \text{ calories} \]"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the week and then divide by the number of days.

1. On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
2. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, so:
   - Tuesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\)
   - Wednesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\)
3. On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
4. On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's sum up the total number of Junebugs removed:
\[ 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 \]

Adding these together:
\[ 39 + 78 = 117 \]
\[ 117 + 78 = 195 \]
\[ 195 + 48 = 243 \]
\[ 243 + 57 = 300 \]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{300}{5} = 60 \]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

For the bus:
- Speed = 60 miles per hour
- Time = 5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

For the car:
- Speed = 30 miles per hour
- Time = 8 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, to find out how much farther the bus went than the car:
- Difference in distance = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of all the other toys and then subtract that total from the overall number of toys.

1. The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
2. The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
3. The tower of stacking rings has 9 rings.
4. The total number of toys is 62.

First, we add up the number of building blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Next, we subtract this sum from the total number of toys to find out how many bouncy balls there are:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

So, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: \( P + Pa + J = 100 \).
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: \( Pa = J + 10 \).
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: \( P = Pa + J \).

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10. \]

Now, we substitute \( Pa = J + 10 \) and \( P = 2J + 10 \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100. \]

Simplify and combine like terms:
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100, \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100. \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 4J = 80. \]

Divide by 4:
\[ J = 20. \]

Now, we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30, \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50. \]

So, the age of Peter is \( 50 \) years.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Maria invited 4 friends, so there are 4 + 1 (Maria) = 5 people in total.
2. Maria gave each of her friends 2 water balloons, so that's 4 friends * 2 balloons = 8 balloons.
3. Maria had 1 water balloon for herself.
4. Then, her mom gave each person 3 more balloons, so that's 5 people * 3 balloons = 15 balloons.

Now, let's add up all the balloons:
- Initial balloons given by Maria: 8 + 1 (for herself) = 9 balloons.
- Additional balloons given by her mom: 15 balloons.

Total balloons = 9 + 15 = 24 balloons.

The girls had a total of 24 balloons."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated and already owned by the charity group.

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so the total number of donated boxes is:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

Adding the 10 boxes they already have:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all 60 boxes, given that each table can hold 2 boxes.

\[ \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes per table}} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

The charity group already owns 15 tables, so the number of new tables they need is:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ tables} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

- Total distance spat by both: \(400 + 420 = 820\) feet
- Number of people: 2

Average total distance spat: \(\frac{820}{2} = 410\) feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of widgets each machine produces in a month.
2. Calculate the revenue from selling the widgets for each machine.
3. Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of widgets produced in a month.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 60
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days in a month: 30
  - Total widgets per month = 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 45
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days in a month: 30
  - Total widgets per month = 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

**Step 2: Calculate the revenue from selling the widgets.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Total revenue = 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Total revenue = 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

**Step 3: Find the difference in revenue.**

- Difference in revenue = Revenue from Widgeteer 3000 - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000
- Difference in revenue = $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

Therefore, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay under both options and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron pays for a 24-hour stay:
\[ \text{Cost for 24-hour stay} = 1600 \text{ pesos} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron pays for the first 12 hours and then adds 70 pesos for each additional hour:
- Cameron stays from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.
- The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos.
- The remaining 5 hours (17 - 12) cost 70 pesos per hour.

So, the cost for the additional 5 hours is:
\[ 5 \times 70 = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

Adding this to the initial 12-hour cost:
\[ \text{Total cost for 17 hours} = 1000 + 350 = 1350 \text{ pesos} \]

Now, we find the difference between the two costs to determine the savings:
\[ \text{Savings} = 1600 - 1350 = 250 \text{ pesos} \]

Therefore, Cameron would save:
\[ \boxed{250} \text{ pesos} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, twice that amount is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pounds. Therefore, each sheep needs \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds of hay.

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. With 15 goats, the total hay needed for the goats is \(15 \times 5 = 75\) pounds.

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. With 12 sheep, the total hay needed for the sheep is \(12 \times 7 = 84\) pounds.

Finally, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs. The total is \(75 + 84 = 159\) pounds.

Therefore, Nate needs \(\boxed{159}\) pounds of hay."
"First, let's calculate how much John earned in the week. He earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:

\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to account for the expenses. John spends $50 on gas, so his remaining money is:

\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John also wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so after the deposit, he will have:

\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to subtract the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs $10 and he buys 5 pencils, so the total cost for the pencils is:

\[ 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} \times 5 \text{ pencils} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from the remaining money gives:

\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many $25 pens he can buy with the remaining $100. The number of pens he can buy is:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Next, we need to find out how many letters Craig's brother has spelled. According to the problem, Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, we add 50 to the total number of letters Craig has spelled:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

Now, to find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the number of letters Craig has spelled to the number of letters his brother has spelled:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

\[ 650 \]"
"To find the total number of children in the drill, we need to calculate the number of children in one row and then multiply that by the total number of rows.

Each row has 8 children, and there are 7 rows per school. Since there are 5 different schools, the total number of rows is:

\[ 7 \text{ rows/school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 35 \text{ rows} \]

Now, since each row has 8 children, the total number of children is:

\[ 8 \text{ children/row} \times 35 \text{ rows} = 280 \text{ children} \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the drill is 280."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming all her coupons. Since each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice and she has 9 coupons, the total number of bottles is:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself."
"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing, we need to consider the fixed visit charge, the labor charge, and the cost of parts.

1. **Fixed Visit Charge**: $40
2. **Labor Charge**: $35 per hour. Since the job took 2.25 hours, we calculate the labor charge as follows:
   \[
   2.25 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$78.75
   \]
3. **Parts Cost**: $60

Now, we add these amounts together to get the total charge:
\[
\$40 + \$78.75 + \$60 = \$178.75
\]

Therefore, the total charge for the job is:
\[
\$178.75

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount:

\[ 10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.40 \times \$150 = \$60 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:

\[ \$150 - \$60 = \$90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each:

\[ 5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40 \text{ per CD} = \$200 \]

Now, we need to determine how much money James was out after selling 5 of the CDs. The amount he was out initially was $90, and he received $200 from selling 5 CDs. Therefore, the net amount he was out is:

\[ \$90 - \$200 = -\$110 \]

Since the question asks how much money he was out, and the negative value indicates he gained money, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$110 \]

James was out \$110 in a negative sense, meaning he gained \$110."
"To calculate how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to multiply the quantity of each type of root crop by its respective price and then sum up the totals.

1. For yams: \(6 \text{ yams} \times \$1.5 \text{ per yam} = \$9\)
2. For sweet potatoes: \(10 \text{ sweet potatoes} \times \$2 \text{ per sweet potato} = \$20\)
3. For carrots: \(4 \text{ carrots} \times \$1.25 \text{ per carrot} = \$5\)

Now, we add up the totals from each type of root crop:

\(\$9 + \$20 + \$5 = \$34\)

Therefore, if Jen sells everything, she will earn \(\$34\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.

2. **Calculate the time it takes to swim the initial distance:**
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time to swim 12 miles: \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \) hours.

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   - James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   - Rest time: \( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   - Total distance: 20 miles.
   - Distance already swum: 12 miles.
   - Remaining distance: \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the new swimming speed:**
   - James swims at half the initial speed.
   - New speed: \( \frac{2 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile/hour} \).

6. **Calculate the time to swim the remaining distance:**
   - Time to swim 8 miles at 1 mile per hour: \( \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \) hours.

7. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Time to swim the initial distance: 6 hours.
   - Rest time: 3 hours.
   - Time to swim the remaining distance: 8 hours.
   - Total time: \( 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 \) hours.

"To calculate Cayley's total commission, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the commission from the New York Times.
2. Calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal.
3. Add the two amounts to get the total commission.

**Step 1: Commission from the New York Times**
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy.
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- He sells 6 copies.

\[ \text{Commission from New York Times} = 6 \times 5 \times 0.10 = 3 \]

**Step 2: Commission from the Wall Street Journal**
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy.
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- He sells 10 copies.

\[ \text{Commission from Wall Street Journal} = 10 \times 15 \times 0.08 = 12 \]

**Step 3: Total Commission**
- Add the commission from both newspapers.

\[ \text{Total Commission} = 3 + 12 = 15 \]

**Final Answer:**

"Deanna is 26 years old.

Since Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, Marcus is:
26 - 5 = 21 years old.

Marcus is also half of Leo’s age, so Leo’s age is:
21 * 2 = 42 years old.

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \) (total points scored by the team)
2. \( B = A + 20 \) (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)
3. \( B = D + 10 \) (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \)
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \)

Now, substitute these expressions into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 25 \) back into the expression for \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"To determine the number of pages in the book, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of pages per inch**: Since the paper is 100 pages to the inch, and each sheet of paper is printed on both sides, each inch of thickness corresponds to 200 pages (100 pages per side).

2. **Calculate the total number of pages**: Given that the book is 1.5 inches thick, we multiply the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book in inches.

\[ \text{Total pages} = 200 \, \text{pages/inch} \times 1.5 \, \text{inches} \]

\[ \text{Total pages} = 300 \, \text{pages} \]

Therefore, the book has 300 pages."
"To determine how many reports Vince stapled, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Vince spent stapling.
2. Determine how many 15-minute intervals are in that total time.
3. Multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports he can staple in each interval.

First, let's find the total time Vince spent stapling. He started at 8:00 AM and stopped at 11:00 PM. The time from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we convert 15 hours into minutes:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
\[ \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince can staple 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Usual Sleep Duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - The total sleep duration is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours.
   - Converting 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Time Waking Up Earlier:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so her usual wake-up time of 6 a.m. is now 5:55 a.m.

3. **Sleepwalking Duration:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is \(2:38 - 2:15 = 23\) minutes.

4. **Time Spent Awake During Sleepwalking:**
   - Since she was awake during the sleepwalking period, we need to subtract this time from her total sleep duration.

5. **Total Time Spent Asleep:**
   - Usual sleep duration: 480 minutes
   - Subtract the time she was awake during sleepwalking: \(480 - 23 = 457\) minutes

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 457 minutes that day."
"Jonathan has two dozen measuring cups. Since one dozen equals 12, two dozen equal 24. Therefore, Jonathan has 24 measuring cups.

Given that Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons he originally has:

\[
\text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16
\]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[
16 - 6 = 10
\]

Now, we add the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has:

\[
24 \text{ (measuring cups)} + 10 \text{ (measuring spoons)} = 34
\]

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

34"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Occupancy:**
   - The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds.
   - Initially, 1/5 of the beds are occupied.
   - Number of occupied beds = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.
   - Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds initially = \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) beds.

2. **Daily Admissions:**
   - 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new admissions = \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Initial occupied beds = 200.
   - New admissions = 700.
   - Total occupied beds after 2 weeks = \( 200 + 700 = 900 \) beds.

4. **Total Unoccupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Total capacity = 1000 beds.
   - Total occupied beds = 900 beds.
   - Total unoccupied beds = \( 1000 - 900 = 100 \) beds.

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the remainder is:

16 - 7 = 9 emails.

Two-thirds of these 9 emails are to family. So, the number of emails to family is:

(2/3) * 9 = 6 emails.

The remaining emails, which are not to family, are:

9 - 6 = 3 emails.

One-third of these remaining emails are to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails to her boyfriend is:

(1/3) * 3 = 1 email.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

\[ 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"If Courtney overstated the number of people by 20%, we can represent the actual number of people as 100% and the number Courtney reported as 120% of the actual number. Let's denote the actual number of people as \( x \).

According to Courtney, the number of people was 48, which is 120% of the actual number. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]

\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"To solve this problem, let's define the number of balls each boy carried in terms of Jeffrey's number of balls.

Let \( J \) represent the number of balls Jeffrey carried. According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by all three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each boy:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

Now, we can find the total number of balls:
\[ 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes by the end of the third day after filling in two holes.
3. Use the information that the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

Let's start with the first step:

- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes.

So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29 \]

By the end of the third day, they had 29 holes. On the fourth day, the number of holes was four times the number of holes at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day was 10. Therefore, the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

The number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the number of holes by the end of the fourth day and the number of holes by the end of the third day:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \]

So, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Let's denote the number of corn chips that Collins received as \( C \). According to the problem, Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, and Collins received 15 more than either of them. Therefore, Collins received \( 70 + 15 = 85 \) corn chips.

The total number of corn chips can be calculated by summing the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:

\[
70 + 70 + 85 = 225

So, the total number of corn chips is \(\boxed{225}\)."
"To find out how much the travel tickets cost, we first need to calculate 50% of the cost of the supplies.

The cost of the supplies is $400. 

50% of $400 is calculated as:
\[ 400 \times \frac{50}{100} = 400 \times 0.5 = 200 \]

So, the travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies, which means:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the travel tickets is $600."
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( X + S + A = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, we can substitute the expression for \( X \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (S + 5) + S + A = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A = 334 \]

Next, we substitute the expression for \( S \) from the third equation into the equation above:
\[ 2(4A - 13) + A = 334 \]
\[ 8A - 26 + A = 334 \]
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we have \( A \), we can find \( S \):
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

Final numerical answer:

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird flew in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction.

1. The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 10 \, \text{hours} \times 30 \, \text{miles/hour} = 300 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. The bird then flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 2 \, \text{hours} \times 18 \, \text{miles/hour} = 36 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 5 \, \text{hours} \times 22 \, \text{miles/hour} = 110 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Now, we sum the distances flown in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction:
\[
\text{Total distance south} = 300 \, \text{miles} + 110 \, \text{miles} = 410 \, \text{miles}
\]
\[
\text{Total distance north} = 36 \, \text{miles}
\]
\[
\text{Net distance south} = 410 \, \text{miles} - 36 \, \text{miles} = 374 \, \text{miles}
\]

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[
\boxed{374 \, \text{miles}}

"Greta initially made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 12 brownies.

At her office party, she received an additional 1/2 dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.

When she got home, there were 4 dozen brownies waiting, which is 48 brownies.

So, the total number of brownies Greta had before the surprise party is:
12 (initial batch) + 6 (from office) + 48 (from friends) = 66 brownies.

During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. Since 1 dozen is 12 brownies, 1 1/2 dozen is 18 brownies.

The number of brownies left over is:
66 (total) - 18 (eaten) = 48 brownies.

Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day."
"Nani is 8 years old.

His brother is twice Nani's age, so the brother is \(8 \times 2 = 16\) years old.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find 25% of Nani's age, we calculate \(8 \times 0.25 = 2\). So, the sister is \(8 - 2 = 6\) years old.

Now, we add up the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister to find the total age:
\[8 + 16 + 6 = 30\]

The total age of all three family members is 30."

- Total time: \(45 + 110 + 72 = 227\) minutes

Therefore, it will take Andy 227 minutes to restring all the racquets."
"John is buying phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which makes a total of 4 phones.

The first 2 phones are at full price, which is $600 each. So, the cost for the first 2 phones is:
2 phones * $600/phone = $1200

The remaining 2 phones are at half price, which is $600 / 2 = $300 each. So, the cost for the remaining 2 phones is:
2 phones * $300/phone = $600

Adding the cost of the first 2 phones and the remaining 2 phones together, we get the total cost:
$1200 + $600 = $1800

Therefore, John paid $1800 for all the phones."
"To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. 

Given that Carlton's team has 13 players and Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = \text{Number of players on Carlton's team} + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 13 + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 20 \]

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

\[ \text{Total number of players} = \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} + \text{Number of players on Carlton's team} \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 20 + 13 \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is 33."
"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of slats} = 100 \]

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"Mrs. Harrington initially bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave away 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes given away. 

So, the number of boxes she kept is:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, which means she kept:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 \text{ boxes} = 2 \text{ boxes} \]

Therefore, the number of boxes she sold is:
\[ 8 - 2 = 6 \text{ boxes} \]

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is:
\[ 6 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges/box} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges."
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, the number of states in India can be expressed as \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India, which is \( x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \).

Simplifying the expression, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \).

Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is 79."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of boxes sold for each type of baked good on both days and then calculate the total earnings.

First, let's find out how many boxes of each item were sold on each day.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 4 fewer boxes than on Sunday

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 5 more boxes than on Saturday
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Now, let's calculate the number of boxes sold on Sunday:
- Gingerbread on Sunday: \(10 + 5 = 15\) boxes
- Apple pie on Sunday: 15 boxes

Next, we calculate the total number of boxes sold for each type over the two days:
- Total gingerbread: \(10 + 15 = 25\) boxes
- Total apple pie: \(4 + 15 = 19\) boxes

Now, we calculate the earnings from each type of baked good:
- Earnings from gingerbread: \(25 \times 6 = 150\) dollars
- Earnings from apple pie: \(19 \times 15 = 285\) dollars

1. **Determine Emil's age when he turns 24:**
   - Emil is currently 19 years old.
   - He will turn 24 in \(24 - 19 = 5\) years.

2. **Determine the age of Emil's dad when Emil is 24:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
   - Let the age of Emil's dad when Emil is 24 be \(D\).
   - Therefore, \(D = 2 \times 24 = 48\).

3. **Determine the current age of Emil's dad:**
   - Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his dad will be \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old now.

4. **Determine the age of Emil's brother when Emil is 24:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
   - Let the age of Emil's brother when Emil is 24 be \(B\).
   - Therefore, \(24 = 2 \times B\).
   - Solving for \(B\), we get \(B = \frac{24}{2} = 12\).

5. **Determine the current age of Emil's brother:**
   - Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his brother will be \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old now.

To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught over the three days, we add the amounts from each day:
\[ 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, the number of servings Joe has is:
\[ \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
7 servings."
"First, let's calculate the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Since 20% of the class are football players, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 football players.

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after accounting for the football players:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We can calculate this as:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = \frac{25}{100} \times 24 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

Now, we add the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members to find the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is:

12"
"If Sophie wears size 5 boots, then Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, which means Charlie wears size \(5 \times 5 = 25\) boots.

To find the average size of the shoes worn by the two, we add the sizes together and divide by 2:

\[
\text{Average size} = \frac{5 + 25}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
\]

The average size of shoe worn by the two is 15."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed and then calculate the cost of the additional plants she needs to buy.

First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the width of the plants and the space between them are given in feet, we'll keep our calculations in feet.

Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot. Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Therefore, each plant and the space between it and the next plant take up 1 + 1.5 = 2.5 feet.

Now, we need to find out how many plants can fit in the 111 feet long flower bed. We divide the total length of the flower bed by the space each plant and the gap between plants take up:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means she can fit 44 plants in her flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:

\[ 44 - 17 = 27 \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:

\[ 27 \times 6 = 162 \]

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, so we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9 \text{ pretzels per day} \]

To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"To determine how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost for each type of plant and then sum these costs.

First, let's calculate the total number of each type of plant needed:
- Each basket requires 3 petunias, so for 5 baskets, the total number of petunias is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).
- Each basket requires 2 sweet potato vines, so for 5 baskets, the total number of sweet potato vines is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).

Next, we calculate the cost for each type of plant:
- The cost of one petunia is $3.00, so the total cost for 15 petunias is \(15 \times 3 = 45\) dollars.
- The cost of one sweet potato vine is $2.50, so the total cost for 10 sweet potato vines is \(10 \times 2.5 = 25\) dollars.

Finally, we add the costs together to find the total amount Katherine will spend:
\[45 + 25 = 70\]

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is \(\boxed{70}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers, so the total soil used for sunflowers is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations, so the total soil used for carnations is \(10 \times 1.5 = 15\) pounds.

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations to find the total soil used for these plants:
\[12 + 15 = 27\] pounds.

The total bag of soil is 30 pounds. So, the remaining soil for planting roses is:
\[30 - 27 = 3\] pounds.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[3 \div 1 = 3\] roses.

Therefore, they can plant 3 roses."
"First, we need to calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times 2000 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with the $500.00 she sets aside each month. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

\[ \text{Number of shoes per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \]

Since she can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0.5 pairs per month, which means she can buy 1 pair every 2 months.

Now, we need to find out how many pairs she can buy in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

\[ \text{Number of pairs per year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months per pair}} = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time it takes for Emily to both peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp:
- Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
- To peel 90 shrimp, it would take her \( \frac{90}{6} = 15 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to sauté 90 shrimp:
- Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- To sauté 90 shrimp, it would take her \( \frac{90}{30} \times 10 = 3 \times 10 = 30 \) minutes.

Since peeling and sautéing are sequential tasks, we add the time for each task:
- Total time = Time to peel + Time to sauté = 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

45 minutes"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the temperature changes in the room over the given time periods.

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Over 3 hours, the temperature change is \(2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 6 \, \text{degrees}\).

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - Over 4 hours, the temperature change is \(3 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 12 \, \text{degrees}\).

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Over 2 hours, the temperature change is \(2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{degrees}\).

Now, we sum up all the temperature changes:
- Cooling effect: \(6 \, \text{degrees} + 12 \, \text{degrees} = 18 \, \text{degrees}\).
- Warming effect: \(4 \, \text{degrees}\).

The net temperature change is:
\[18 \, \text{degrees} - 4 \, \text{degrees} = 14 \, \text{degrees}\].

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

**Final answer: 14 degrees.**"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

3. **Determine the time between the first and second sightings of the comet:**
   - Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time between the first and second sightings is 75 years.

4. **Calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and the time between the first and second sightings is 75 years, then Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each type of payment and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

2. **Gas bill**: Similarly, he writes one check per month for the gas bill, which also results in:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

3. **Church**: He writes two checks per month to the church. Over a year, this amounts to:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ checks}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service**: He writes one check every quarter (3 months) to the pest and lawn service. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes:
   \[
   4 \text{ checks}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52 \text{ checks}
\]

Therefore, Buford writes a total of 52 checks per year."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips each day. These trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, the first plane makes \(44 \times 2 = 88\) trips each day.

2. Out of these 88 trips, three-quarters of the flights are to Greece. So, the number of flights to Greece is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66
   \]

3. The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The remaining flights are:
   \[
   88 - 66 = 22
   \]
   Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is:
   \[
   \frac{22}{2} = 11
   \]

Therefore, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Tobias' Howl Duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's Howl Duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Igneous' Howl Duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - Combined duration of Tobias and Chikote's howls = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.
   - Therefore, Igneous' howl duration = 60 seconds.

4. **Combined Length of All Howls:**
   - Total howl duration = Tobias' howl + Chikote's howl + Igneous' howl
   - Total howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert Seconds to Minutes:**
   - 120 seconds = 120 / 60 minutes = 2 minutes.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and then subtract that from the total cost of the trousers.

1. Adam's mother gave him $6.
2. Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.
3. The total amount of money given by his parents is \(6 + 12 = 18\) dollars.
4. The trousers cost $30.

Now, we subtract the total amount given by his parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

So, Adam had to contribute \(\boxed{12}\) dollars from his savings."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \( A \), \( B \), \( H \), and \( W \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
- \( A = 3 \) (Akbar's age)
- \( B = 4 \) (Alessandro's age)
- The total age of the children is 20, so \( A + B + H + W = 20 \).
- Helene's age \( H \) is twice the average age of the group.

First, we can express the total age equation as:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

The average age of the group is:
\[ \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene's age is twice the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, substituting \( H = 10 \) into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is \( 3 \)."

Walter's lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Since everyone else donates $2000, the lawyer's donation will be 3 times $2000, which is $6000.

Therefore, the lawyer is going to contribute $6000."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is \( 2 + 4 = 6 \). The total size of the watermelon can be represented as the sum of all the slices, which is \( 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \).

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \), and the total size of the watermelon is \( 8x \). Therefore, the fraction of the watermelon that each adult gets is \( \frac{2x}{8x} = \frac{1}{4} \).

To convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to work backwards from the time she wants to serve it, which is 5:00 pm.

1. Frosting the cake takes 10 minutes.
2. Cooling the cake takes 2 hours (120 minutes).
3. Baking the cake takes 30 minutes.
4. Making the cake batter takes 20 minutes.

Adding these times together:
- 10 minutes (frosting) + 120 minutes (cooling) + 30 minutes (baking) + 20 minutes (making batter) = 180 minutes

180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours.

Now, subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to have it ready to serve at 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter.
2. Use the total number of chocolate bars sold to find the number of bars per box.

First, let's add the number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter:
- Lisa sold 3.5 boxes.
- Peter sold 4.5 boxes.

Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

Next, we know that together they sold 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:

Number of chocolate bars per box = Total chocolate bars / Total boxes
Number of chocolate bars per box = 64 / 8
Number of chocolate bars per box = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per session for the studio.
2. Calculate the total cost per day for the studio.
3. Calculate the total cost per week for the studio.
4. Calculate the total cost per month for the studio.

First, let's calculate the cost per session for the studio:
- The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
- The cost per student per session is $1.50.
- With 10 students, the cost per session for students is \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost per session is \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost per day for the studio:
- The studio is rented 3 days a week.
- So, the total cost per day is \(40 \times 3 = 120\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost per week for the studio:
- Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the total cost per week is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) dollars.

Finally, we calculate the total cost per month for the studio:
- The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is \(480\) dollars.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( p \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( m \).

- Peter has 4 boxes, so the total number of chocolate bars Peter has is \( 4p = 64 \).
- Martha has 7 boxes, so the total number of chocolate bars Martha has is \( 7m = 56 \).

First, we solve for \( p \) and \( m \):
\[ 4p = 64 \]
\[ p = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

\[ 7m = 56 \]
\[ m = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

"To find the number of porcupines in the park after a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of female porcupines.
2. Determine the number of baby porcupines born each month.
3. Calculate the total number of baby porcupines born in a year.
4. Add the number of baby porcupines to the initial population to get the final number of porcupines.

Step 1: Calculate the number of female porcupines.
The number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population.
\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Step 2: Determine the number of baby porcupines born each month.
Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
\[ \text{Number of baby porcupines born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of baby porcupines born in a year.
There are 12 months in a year.
\[ \text{Total number of baby porcupines born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the price per gallon.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) can be calculated using the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:
\[ V = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.**

The conversion factor is 5.9 gallons per cubic foot. So, we multiply the volume in cubic feet by 5.9 to get the volume in gallons:
\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 5.9 \, \text{gallons per cubic foot} \]
\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost based on the price per gallon.**

The cost is $0.10 per gallon. So, we multiply the volume in gallons by the cost per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars per gallon} \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is $826."

1. There are 9 red sticks.
2. There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so the number of blue sticks is \(9 + 5 = 14\).
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is \(14 - 3 = 11\).

Now, to find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

\[9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34\]

Therefore, the total number of sticks is 34."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

For Matteo:
- Speed = 55 miles per hour
- Time = 4 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

For Shandy:
- Speed = 45 miles per hour
- Time = 10 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo:
- Difference in distance = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
   - Tank's capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Water filled by Wanda on the first day = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
   - Water filled by Ms. B on the first day = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the first day = \( 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \) gallons.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water pumped by Wanda on the second day = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the second day = \( 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \) gallons.

3. **Total Water Filled:**
   - Total water filled in two days = \( 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \) gallons.

4. **Water Remaining:**
   - Tank's capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Water remaining = \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

**Final Answer:**
6000 gallons"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final charge percentage to the initial charge percentage when Maria left for the park.

1. **Final Charge Calculation:**
   - After 8 hours, the power bank was at 28% charge.

2. **Charge Loss in the Last 3 Hours:**
   - For the last 3 hours, the power bank lost 7% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge percentage at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge would be \( x - 3 \times 7\% = x - 21\% \).
   - We know this equals 28%, so:
     \[
     x - 21\% = 28\%
     \]
     \[
     x = 28\% + 21\% = 49\%
     \]

3. **Charge Loss in the First 5 Hours:**
   - For the first 5 hours, the power bank lost 9% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge percentage at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge would be \( y - 5 \times 9\% = y - 45\% \).
   - We know this equals 49%, so:
     \[
     y - 45\% = 49\%
     \]
     \[
     y = 49\% + 45\% = 94\%
     \]

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%."
"First, let's calculate Janet's total earnings per hour from both wages and tips:

\[ \text{Hourly wage} + \text{Hourly tips} = \$10 + \$15 = \$25 \]

Next, we calculate her weekly earnings by multiplying her hourly earnings by the number of hours she works in a week:

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = \$25 \times 40 = \$1000 \]

Janet wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car for a down payment. So, we calculate 20% of $10,000:

\[ \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times \$10000 = \$2000 \]

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\$2000}{\$1000} = 2 \]

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jamaar has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost of the items already purchased:

\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10, so the amount of money he has left after his purchases is:

\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:

\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums."
"First, we calculate the total number of sweets Anne has:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack contains 60 pieces, so the total number of pieces given to her friends is:

\[ 13 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Since she gave these 780 pieces to 10 friends equally, the number of pieces each friend received is:

\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

Therefore, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply a 5% increase to the original price each year.

1. **Initial Price**: $120

2. **After 1st Year**:
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 120 + (120 \times 0.05) = 120 \times 1.05 = 126
   \]

3. **After 2nd Year**:
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 126 + (126 \times 0.05) = 126 \times 1.05 = 132.30
   \]

4. **After 3rd Year**:
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 132.30 + (132.30 \times 0.05) = 132.30 \times 1.05 = 139.465
   \]

Rounding $139.465$ to the nearest integer, we get $139$.

**Final Answer**: 139"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pictures Olivia put into each album and then figure out how many of those are selfies and portraits.

First, we know that Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and divided them equally among 8 albums. So, we divide 72 by 8 to find out how many pictures are in each album:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

This means each album contains 9 pictures.

Next, we know that 3 of the albums are selfies only and 2 of the albums are portraits only. This means there are 3 albums with only selfies and 2 albums with only portraits. The remaining albums (8 total - 3 selfies - 2 portraits = 3 albums) could contain a mix of selfies and portraits, but the problem does not specify this, so we assume the question is asking only about the selfies and portraits in the specified albums.

Since the 3 albums are selfies only, the total number of selfies is:

\[ 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 27 \text{ selfies} \]

And since the 2 albums are portraits only, the total number of portraits is:

\[ 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 18 \text{ portraits} \]

So, the total number of portraits and selfies is:

\[ 27 \text{ selfies} + 18 \text{ portraits} = 45 \]

Final numerical answer:

"To find out how long James spends reading, we first need to determine how long it takes him to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time per page as follows:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} \]

Now, we know he reads 18 pages. To find the total time spent reading, we multiply the time per page by the number of pages:

\[ \text{Total time} = \left( \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} \right) \times 18 \text{ pages} \]

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{10 \times 18}{3} \text{ minutes} \]

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{180}{3} \text{ minutes} \]

\[ \text{Total time} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

James spends 60 minutes reading."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of guests**: The hotel started with 100 guests.

2. **Early checkouts**: 24 guests checked out early.
   - Guests after early checkouts: \(100 - 24 = 76\)

3. **Late checkouts**: 15 guests opted for a late checkout.
   - Guests after late checkouts: \(76 - 15 = 61\)

4. **Afternoon check-ins**: Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout.
   - Number of people who checked in: \(2 \times 15 = 30\)
   - Guests after afternoon check-ins: \(61 + 30 = 91\)

5. **Check-ins after dinner**: 7 more people checked in.
   - Final number of guests: \(91 + 7 = 98\)

"John picks 4 bananas on Wednesday.
He picks 6 bananas on Thursday.
On Friday, he picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

To find the total number of bananas John has, we add the bananas picked each day:
4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas.

John has 22 bananas."
"First, let's break down the total number of questions and categorize them:

- Total number of questions: 60
- Percentage of easy questions: 40%
- Number of easy questions: \( 60 \times 0.40 = 24 \)
- Number of average and difficult questions: \( 60 - 24 = 36 \)
- Since the remaining questions are equally divided between average and difficult, we have:
  - Number of average questions: \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \)
  - Number of difficult questions: \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \)

Next, we calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct in each category:

- Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct:
  - Number of easy questions Aries gets correct: \( 24 \times 0.75 = 18 \)

- Aries is sure to get half of the average and difficult questions correct:
  - Number of average questions Aries gets correct: \( 18 \times 0.5 = 9 \)
  - Number of difficult questions Aries gets correct: \( 18 \times 0.5 = 9 \)

Now, we sum up the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:

- Total correct answers: \( 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 \)

Therefore, Aries is sure to get \(\boxed{36}\) points."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the price of a small stuffed animal be \( S \).
2. According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars.
3. The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small one, so the price of a large stuffed animal is \( 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.
4. Let the number of large stuffed animals sold be \( L \).
5. The number of small stuffed animals sold is twice the number of large ones, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2L \).
6. The total earnings from the sales are $120.

The total earnings can be expressed as:
\[ 12L + 4(2L) = 120 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 12L + 8L = 120 \]
\[ 20L = 120 \]
\[ L = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ L = 6 \]

So, Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals. Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones:
\[ 2L = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"First, let's determine the amount of ore a single dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day. We know that a dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is:

\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ pounds per day} \]

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. So, the amount of ore mined per day with a steel pickaxe is:

\[ 24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days, each using a steel pickaxe. The total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves in one day is:

\[ 40 \times 36 = 1440 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Over 30 days, the total amount of ore mined is:

\[ 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{43200} \]"
"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich for each package and then use that to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

First, let's calculate the price per sandwich for each package:

1. For the first package:
   - 2 sandwiches for $3
   - Price per sandwich = $3 / 2 = $1.50

2. For the second package:
   - 4 sandwiches for $6
   - Price per sandwich = $6 / 4 = $1.50

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages, which is $1.50.

Now, we can find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
- Cost = 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12."
"First, we need to determine the remaining amount Tom needs to pay after selling his old bedroom set. He buys a new one for $3000 and sells his old one for $1000, so the remaining amount is:

\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% of this remaining amount each month. To find out how much he needs to pay per month, we calculate 10% of $2000:

\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ 200 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst due to the wind. 

\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]

So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving her with:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of her 12 yellow balloons:

\[ 12 \div 2 = 6 \]

This means she has:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

yellow balloons left. 

As she nears the school, she finds 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and adds 75% of them to her clutch of balloons. 

\[ 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]

So, she adds 6 blue balloons to her collection. 

Now, we sum up all the balloons she has:

\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 6 \text{ (blue)} = 27 \]

Therefore, the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school is:

\[ 27 \]"
"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.5
   - If a substitute teacher is present, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. So, the probability that he does not have to turn in his homework in this scenario is 100% or 1.0.

2. **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher being present: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.4
   - If the normal teacher gives an extension, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. So, the probability that he does not have to turn in his homework in this scenario is 0.4.

3. **Normal Teacher without Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher being present: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.6
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension: 20% or 0.2
   - Probability of Marcus not getting a personal extension: 80% or 0.8
   - If the normal teacher does not give an extension and Marcus does not get a personal extension, Marcus has to turn in his homework. So, the probability that he has to turn in his homework in this scenario is 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.48.

Now, we combine these probabilities:

- Probability of having a substitute teacher and not having to turn in homework: 0.5 * 1.0 = 0.5
- Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension and not having to turn in homework: 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2
- Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus not getting a personal extension and having to turn in homework: 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.24

Adding these probabilities together gives the total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

0.5 + 0.2 + 0.24 = 0.94

Converting this to a percentage, we get:

0.94 * 100% = 94%

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 94%."
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats already allocated for graduates and faculty.
2. Subtract this number from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center to find out how many seats are available for guests.
3. Divide the number of available guest seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive.

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of soda bottles Richard will place.
2. Determine the total time it will take to place all the bottles and drop the candy.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of soda bottles.**

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. This means the number of intervals between the bottles is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ intervals} \]

Since there is a bottle at the start and one at the end of each interval, the total number of bottles is:
\[ 8 + 1 = 9 \text{ bottles} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total time to place all the bottles and drop the candy.**

Richard takes 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next. Since there are 8 intervals between 9 bottles, the total time to place all the bottles and drop the candy is:
\[ 8 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ seconds/interval} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:
\[ \boxed{40} \text{ seconds} \]"

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make \(\boxed{10}\) packs of apples."
"To find out how much money Amor will have left after buying the cheese, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she buys and then subtract that from the $50 she started with.

First, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:
- The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound.
- Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.
- Therefore, the cost of the Parmesan cheese is \(2 \times 11 = 22\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the Mozzarella cheese:
- The price of Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
- Amor buys 3 pounds of Mozzarella cheese.
- Therefore, the cost of the Mozzarella cheese is \(3 \times 6 = 18\) dollars.

Now, let's find the total cost of the cheese:
- The total cost is the sum of the cost of the Parmesan and Mozzarella cheese.
- Therefore, the total cost is \(22 + 18 = 40\) dollars.

Finally, let's find out how much money Amor will have left:
- Amor starts with $50.
- She spends $40 on cheese.
- Therefore, the money left is \(50 - 40 = 10\) dollars.

So, the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat is:
10 dollars."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim borrowed for college, the total income he would have earned without going to college, and the total income he will earn with his college degree. Then, we can determine how long it will take for him to earn back the money he spent and lost.

1. **Calculate the total amount borrowed for college:**
   - Jim borrows $50,000 per year for 4 years.
   - Total amount borrowed = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

2. **Calculate the total income lost from not working while in school:**
   - Jim's annual income before college was $25,000.
   - Total income lost = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn back:**
   - Total amount to earn back = Total amount borrowed + Total income lost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

4. **Calculate Jim's new annual income after earning a college degree:**
   - His income is tripled, so his new annual income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000.

5. **Determine how long it will take to earn back the $300,000:**
   - Time to earn back = Total amount to earn back / New annual income = $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces he requires. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece is:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece is:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one fabric piece:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ \text{Total area} = 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, Jim needs to buy:
\[ \boxed{160} \text{ square feet of fabric} \]"

   - One-fifth of Monday's delivery: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)

3. **Wednesday's Delivery:**
   - Twice as many as Tuesday's delivery: \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \)
   - 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery: \( 204 + 5 = 209 \)

4. **Total Delivery from Monday to Wednesday:**
   - Monday: 425 letters
   - Tuesday: 102 letters
   - Wednesday: 209 letters
   - Total: \( 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \)

"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost for each type of salad and then add them together.

1. Calculate the cost for the chicken salad:
   - 10 people want chicken salad.
   - Each chicken salad costs $6.50.
   - Total cost for chicken salad = 10 people * $6.50/person = $65.00.

2. Calculate the cost for the pasta salad:
   - 6 people want pasta salad.
   - Each pasta salad costs $6.00.
   - Total cost for pasta salad = 6 people * $6.00/person = $36.00.

3. Add the costs together to get the total amount:
   - Total cost = Cost of chicken salad + Cost of pasta salad
   - Total cost = $65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00.

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.00."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. So, he won \(2 \times 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11\) dollars.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money lost and won:

- Total loss: $5 (first race) + $16.5 (third race) = $21.5
- Total win: $11 (second race)

Net loss: $21.5 - $11 = $10.5

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races (3):

\[
\text{Average loss} = \frac{10.5}{3} = 3.5
\]

So, Johnny's dad lost on average $3.5 per race that day."
"To find the total population of South America based on the given information, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of cities in South America: There are 26 countries, and each country has 5 cities. So, the total number of cities is \(26 \times 5 = 130\).
2. Determine the population of each city: Each city has 1000 people.
3. Calculate the total population: Multiply the number of cities by the population of each city. So, the total population is \(130 \times 1000 = 130,000\).

Therefore, the total population of South America, based on the given conditions, is 130,000 people."
"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we first need to calculate their current heights.

Xavier was originally 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert Xavier's original height to inches:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
Adding the growth:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was originally 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem, the second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation as:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( \boxed{420} \)."
"To determine the total hours of work each painter put in, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days the painters worked.
2. Determine the total fraction of a day worked per day.
3. Convert the fraction of a day to hours.
4. Calculate the total hours worked by the team.
5. Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours each painter worked.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The team worked for 3 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days they worked is:
   \[
   3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}
   \]

2. Each painter worked \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day every day.

3. Convert \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day to hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day:
   \[
   \frac{3}{8} \text{ of a day} = \frac{3}{8} \times 24 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. The total hours worked by the team over 21 days is:
   \[
   21 \text{ days} \times 9 \text{ hours/day} = 189 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. Since there are 4 painters, the hours each painter worked is:
   \[
   \frac{189 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ painters}} = 47.25 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, each painter put in 47.25 hours of work."
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
1. In the first set, he retrieved four more balls than in the second set, so he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
2. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
3. The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) + 2(4) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + x + 8 = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, we can find the number of balls he retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010, which is a span of 3 years. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% of its value each year (100% - 21% = 79%).

The formula to calculate the value after depreciation is:
\[ \text{Value after depreciation} = \text{Initial value} \times (1 - \text{depreciation rate})^{\text{number of years}} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

Now, let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.79^3 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9861} \]"
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to determine the number of books written in English and German.

1. Calculate the number of English books:
   - Half of the 50 books are in English.
   - Number of English books = \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \).

2. Calculate the number of German books:
   - 10% of the 50 books are in German.
   - Number of German books = \( 50 \times \frac{10}{100} = 5 \).

3. Calculate the number of Spanish books:
   - Total books = 50
   - Subtract the number of English and German books from the total.
   - Number of Spanish books = \( 50 - 25 - 5 = 20 \).

Therefore, the number of Spanish books is 20."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we first need to calculate the total distance she has already covered and then subtract that from the total distance between San Diego and New York City.

1. Calculate the total distance Bernice has driven:
   \[ \text{Distance driven} = 325 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 1300 \, \text{km} \]

2. Subtract the distance driven from the total distance:
   \[ \text{Distance remaining} = 1955 \, \text{km} - 1300 \, \text{km} = 655 \, \text{km} \]

So, Bernice still needs to drive 655 kilometers."
"Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Over 30 days, she would drink:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, the number of gallons she drinks in 30 days is:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"Initially, there are 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train:
120 + 20 = 140 people on the train.

At the second stop, 50 people descend, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train:
140 - 50 + 100 = 190 people on the train.

At the third stop, 80 people descend:
190 - 80 = 110 people on the train.

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110."
"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. Tank top: $10

"To determine the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of tiles needed.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of tiles and their cost per tile.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of tiles needed.**

Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is:
\[ 1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt} \]

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt. Therefore, the number of tiles needed is:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ SqFt}}{1 \text{ SqFt per tile}} = 200 \text{ tiles} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost.**

Each tile costs $12. Therefore, the total cost for 200 tiles is:
\[ 200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars per tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

**Final Answer:**
\[ \boxed{2400} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the increased monthly cost of the insurance after the accident. The normal cost is $120 a month, and it increased by 60%. 

To find the increased amount, we calculate 60% of $120:
\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the new monthly cost is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Now, to find the annual cost, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for the insurance."
"Greg uses 4 twin sheets and 1 king sheet per week. 

- For the twin beds: 4 sheets per bed * 4 beds = 16 twin sheets per week.
- For the king bed: 1 king sheet per week.

Since the machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time and 1 king set at a time, we calculate the number of loads per week:

- Twin sheets: 16 sheets / 2 sheets per load = 8 loads per week.
- King sheets: 1 sheet / 1 sheet per load = 1 load per week.

Total loads per week: 8 (twin) + 1 (king) = 9 loads per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads per year is:

9 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 468 loads/year.

Therefore, Greg does 468 loads of laundry in a year."
"Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend (Saturday and Sunday), they watch a total of 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

Over 4 weeks, the total number of movies they can watch is 6 movies/weekend * 4 weekends = 24 movies.

"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so his collection increased to:
100 (previous amount) + 50 (collected last year) = 150 stickers.

This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as last year, which is:
2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Adding this year's collection to his last year's total gives:
150 (last year's total) + 100 (collected this year) = 250 stickers.

So, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection."
"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of cat food consumed by all three cats in one day.
2. Determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last based on the daily consumption.

First, let's find out how much food is consumed by all three cats in one feeding:
- Each cat eats 60 grams per feeding.
- There are 3 cats.
- They are fed twice a day.

So, the total amount of food consumed per feeding for all three cats is:
\[ 60 \text{ grams/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 180 \text{ grams/feeding} \]

Since they are fed twice a day, the total daily consumption is:
\[ 180 \text{ grams/feeding} \times 2 \text{ feedings/day} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last:
\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \(7 \times 2 = 14\) slices. 

To find the total number of slices eaten, we add the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia: \(10 + 7 + 14 = 31\).

Therefore, the total number of slices they ate is 31."
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, we can express Betsy's part as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for the meal is the sum of both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part is 18 minutes longer, we calculate:

\[ Betsy's \ part = D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long."
"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to add up all the individual charges:

1. **Cast**: $200
2. **Doctor's Visit**: The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the charge would be half of $300, which is $150.
3. **Painkillers**: $4 per pill for 30 pills, which totals to $4 * 30 = $120.
4. **Parking**: $6 per hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours, which totals to $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, we add all these charges together:

$200 (cast) + $150 (doctor's visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"First, we need to determine how many emails James receives in a day that require a response. Since 20% of the emails don't require any response, that means 80% of the emails do require a response.

80% of 80 emails is calculated as:
\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \]

So, James responds to 64 emails each day. 

Next, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week. We do this by multiplying the number of emails he responds to each day by the number of workdays in a week:
\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
320"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to add up the number of classes that visited each day.

- Wednesday: Three times as many as Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes
- Thursday: 30 classes
- Friday: 25 classes

Now, let's add these numbers together:

\[32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25\]

First, add 32 and 64:

\[32 + 64 = 96\]

Next, add 96 and 96:

\[96 + 96 = 192\]

Then, add 30:

\[192 + 30 = 222\]

Finally, add 25:

\[222 + 25 = 247\]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is:

- 100 on the third test
- 80 on the fourth test

The total score is:
100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

Now, we divide the total score by the number of tests, which is 4:
380 / 4 = 95

Therefore, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate:

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. So, the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club is:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of pizzas left from the glee club's order is:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \]

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ate:

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

The football team ate 80% of their pizzas. So, the number of pizzas eaten by the football team is:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]

Therefore, the number of pizzas left from the football team's order is:

"Anthony is sending out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons, which means he is sending out 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons.

The cost to mail each small coupon is 5 cents, so the total cost for the small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = 3500 cents.

The cost to mail each big coupon is 15 cents, so the total cost for the big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = 21000 cents.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the small and big coupons together: 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert 24500 cents to dollars: 24500 cents / 100 = $245.

Therefore, Anthony spends a total of $245 on postage."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Order by Sidney:**
   - Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches.
   - So, Sidney ordered \(10 - 3 = 7\) meatball sub sandwiches.
   - Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.
   - Therefore, the total number of meatballs in Sidney's initial order is \(7 \times 4 = 28\) meatballs.

2. **Mark's Consumption:**
   - Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches.
   - So, the number of meatball sub sandwiches remaining after Mark ate is \(7 - 4 = 3\) sub sandwiches.
   - The number of meatballs in these remaining sub sandwiches is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) meatballs.

3. **Additional Order by Sidney:**
   - Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches.
   - The number of meatballs in these additional sub sandwiches is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) meatballs.

4. **Total Meatballs in Remaining Sub Sandwiches:**
   - The total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is the sum of the meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches after Mark ate and the additional sub sandwiches ordered by Sidney.

"Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. Since he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter he buys, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.

Let's calculate the cost step by step:

1. **Without the promotion:**
   - Cost per pound of butter = $4.00
   - Total cost for 6 pounds = 6 * $4.00 = $24.00

2. **With the promotion:**
   - For every pound of butter, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.
   - So, for every 1.5 pounds of butter, he pays for 1 pound at full price and 0.5 pounds at half price.
   - The cost for 1 pound at full price = $4.00
   - The cost for 0.5 pounds at half price = 0.5 * $4.00 = $2.00
   - Total cost for 1.5 pounds of butter = $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00

3. **Calculating the total cost for 6 pounds:**
   - Since 6 pounds is equivalent to 4 sets of 1.5 pounds (6 / 1.5 = 4),
   - Total cost = 4 * $6.00 = $24.00

Therefore, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter, taking the promotion into account, is $24.00."
"First, let's determine the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- 25 classmates
- 7 girls in her dance class
- 13 family members

Total guests invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Since 4 people said they could not come, the actual number of guests attending the party is:

45 - 4 = 41

The cost to rent the theater is $125, and there is an additional $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20. So, the number of additional guests is:

41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is:

21 * $6 = $126

Adding the base rental fee to the cost of the additional guests gives us the total cost:

$125 + $126 = $251

Therefore, the total cost of the party is $251."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine how much money Maggie and Riza each had initially.

1. Maggie spent a quarter of her money and has $60 left. This means that the $60 is three-quarters of her initial amount. We can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Maggie's initial amount} = 60
   \]
   To find Maggie's initial amount, we solve for it:
   \[
   \text{Maggie's initial amount} = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
   \]
   So, Maggie initially had $80.

2. Riza spent one-third of her money and has $60 left. This means that the $60 is two-thirds of her initial amount. We can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Riza's initial amount} = 60
   \]
   To find Riza's initial amount, we solve for it:
   \[
   \text{Riza's initial amount} = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
   \]
   So, Riza initially had $90.

Next, we calculate how much money each of them spent.

3. Maggie spent a quarter of her initial amount:
   \[
   \text{Maggie's spent amount} = \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20
   \]
   So, Maggie spent $20.

4. Riza spent one-third of her initial amount:
   \[
   \text{Riza's spent amount} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
   \]
   So, Riza spent $30.

Finally, we calculate how much money each of them has left.

5. Maggie has $60 left.
6. Riza has $60 left.

To find the total amount of money they have left together, we add the amounts:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bananas each of the three monkeys eats per day and then find out how many the third monkey eats.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys in a day:

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so it eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.

Now, let's find out how many bananas the first two monkeys eat together in a day:

\[10 + 14 = 24\]

This means that the first two monkeys together eat 24 bananas each day. Since the total number of bananas Mr. Robles buys is enough to feed the three monkeys for a week (7 days), we can calculate the total number of bananas consumed by all three monkeys in a week:

\[315 \text{ bananas} = 7 \text{ days} \times \text{total bananas per day}\]

So, the total number of bananas consumed by all three monkeys per day is:

\[315 \div 7 = 45\]

Now, we know that the first two monkeys together eat 24 bananas each day, so the third monkey must eat the remaining bananas each day:

\[45 - 24 = 21\]

Therefore, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

Final answer:
21"
"Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed 250 pieces. Then, he started and finished another 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed all 500 pieces of the second puzzle.

To find the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we add the pieces from both puzzles:

250 pieces (from the first puzzle) + 500 pieces (from the second puzzle) = 750 pieces

Therefore, Teddy placed 750 puzzle pieces during that hour."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 15 roses. Since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for 15 roses is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which amounts to:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she needs an additional $5 to cover the cost. The florist can only give change in quarters, and since 1 quarter is $0.25, we need to find out how many quarters make up $5:

\[ \$5 \div \$0.25/\text{quarter} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 20 quarters. 

20 quarters"
"To calculate the total money Terry makes, we need to multiply the quantity of each item by its price and then sum up the totals.

1. Milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 each = $33.00
2. Burger platters: 9 platters * $11 each = $99.00
3. Sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 each = $30.00

Now, we add up these amounts to get the total:

$33.00 + $99.00 + $30.00 = $162.00

Therefore, Terry makes a total of $162.00."
"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find the difference between the time Paul boards the fourth train and the time he arrives at the station.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Departs after 30 minutes (10 minutes arrival + 20 minutes stay).

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train departs, which is 60 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Stays for a quarter of the first train's stay time, which is 5 minutes (20 minutes / 4).
   - Departs after 65 minutes (60 minutes arrival + 5 minutes stay).

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train departs, which is 125 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Leaves immediately after arriving, so it departs at 125 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train departs, which is 145 minutes after the first train arrives.

Paul will board the fourth train at 145 minutes after he arrives at the station. Since he arrives at the station at the start (0 minutes), he will wait 145 minutes for his train.

**Final Answer:**
145 minutes"
"Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. To find out how many toothpicks she has already saved, we multiply the number of toothpicks saved per week by the number of weeks:

\[ 10 \, \text{toothpicks/week} \times 12 \, \text{weeks} = 120 \, \text{toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks for the sculpture. To find out how many more toothpicks she needs, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total required:

\[ 200 \, \text{toothpicks} - 120 \, \text{toothpicks} = 80 \, \text{toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, we can find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks by dividing the number of toothpicks needed by the number of toothpicks saved per week:

\[ \frac{80 \, \text{toothpicks}}{10 \, \text{toothpicks/week}} = 8 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price.

Original price of the watch = $2000

Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for = 75% of $2000
= 0.75 * $2000
= $1500

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for = 120% of $1500
= 1.20 * $1500
= $1800

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price of the watch.

Discount = Original price - Sale price
= $2000 - $1800
= $200

Percentage discount = (Discount / Original price) * 100%
= ($200 / $2000) * 100%
= 0.1 * 100%
= 10%

The percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, a single spring creates 1 jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - 1 minute = 60 seconds
   - Therefore, 4 hours = 4 × 60 × 60 = 14,400 seconds

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since 1 jellyfish is created every second, in 14,400 seconds, one spring will create 14,400 jellyfish.

4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14,400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create 5 × 14,400 = 72,000 jellyfish.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
72,000 jellyfish."
"Frankie's score was 15 better than twice Binkie's score. Binkie's score was 90.

First, calculate twice Binkie's score:
2 * 90 = 180

Then, add 15 to this amount to find Frankie's score:
180 + 15 = 195

Frankie's score was 195."
"James walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles (since the total distance is 4 miles). He then had to walk back home, covering another 2 miles. After picking up what he forgot, he walked the 2 miles again to reach the store.

In total, he walked 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 miles.

Since he walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, the time it took him to walk 6 miles is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles/hour}} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

It took him 1.5 hours to reach the store."
"To determine how much money Jenny saved, we need to compare the cost of buying 10 bunches of bananas versus buying the same number of bananas individually.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from 10 bunches:
- Each bunch contains an average of 4 bananas.
- Therefore, 10 bunches contain \(10 \times 4 = 40\) bananas.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 40 bananas individually:
- Each banana costs $0.80.
- Therefore, the cost for 40 bananas is \(40 \times 0.80 = 32\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches:
- Each bunch costs $3.00.
- Therefore, the cost for 10 bunches is \(10 \times 3.00 = 30\) dollars.

Finally, we find the savings by subtracting the cost of buying the bananas in bunches from the cost of buying them individually:
- Savings = Cost of buying individually - Cost of buying in bunches
- Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00

Therefore, Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \).

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total length of the fence is 100 feet.
2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.

We can express these as equations:
\[ S + H = 100 \]
\[ H = S + 60 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]
\[ 2S = 40 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to determine the growth rate per year. 

Given that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, we can calculate the annual growth rate as follows:

\[ \text{Annual growth rate} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \]

Now, to find out how much the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we multiply the annual growth rate by 13:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of each type of bike sold.
2. Calculate the earnings from each type of bike.
3. Sum up the earnings to get the total.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of each type of bike sold.**

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 50% of 300 = 0.50 * 300 = 150
- BMX bikes: 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45
- MTB bikes: The rest, which is 300 - 150 - 45 = 105

**Step 2: Calculate the earnings from each type of bike.**

- Price of an MTB: $500
- Price of a BMX: $500 / 2 = $250
- Price of a Trekking bike: $450

- Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500
- Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250
- Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500

**Step 3: Sum up the earnings to get the total.**

Total earnings = $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

Marcel earned $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the rate of hay production and pickup:**
   - The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.
   - The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.

2. **Calculate the net change in the number of bales per hour:**
   - Net change per hour = Hay produced - Hay picked up
   - Net change per hour = 5 bales - 3 bales = 2 bales

3. **Calculate the total net change over 6 hours:**
   - Total net change = Net change per hour * Number of hours
   - Total net change = 2 bales/hour * 6 hours = 12 bales

4. **Determine the number of bales left in the field:**
   - Since the farmer starts with a certain number of bales (which is not specified), we can only calculate the net change in the number of bales.
   - If we assume the field starts with 0 bales (or the initial number of bales is not relevant to the net change calculation), then the number of bales left in the field after 6 hours is the total net change.

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field after 6 hours is 12.

12"
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long. Therefore, the total time spent in classes each weekday is:

\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total time spent in classes during the weekdays is:

\[ 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on these days. First, we find \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his total weekly minutes:

\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he spends this time equally on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time per week is:

\[ 100 \text{ minutes} \times 2 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent in classes and the extra learning time to get the total weekly learning time:

\[ 1600 \text{ minutes} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends learning each week is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped.
2. Calculate the height after the first bounce.
3. Calculate the height after the second bounce.

The initial height from which the ball is dropped is the height of the third floor, which is 24 feet.

The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. So, after the first bounce, the height will be:
\[ 24 \times \frac{2}{3} = 16 \text{ feet} \]

After the second bounce, the height will be:
\[ 16 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{32}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 10.67 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is \(\frac{32}{3}\) feet or approximately 10.67 feet.

\[
\boxed{\frac{32}{3} \text{ feet}}

"The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many bags of apples were sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings based on the price per bag.

First, we know that each bag contains 10 apples. The orchard sold a total of 2000 apples. To find out how many bags were sold, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we know that each bag is sold for $5. To find the total earnings, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which means \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \) kilograms.

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate."
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are 10 feet by 8 feet, so each wall has an area of \(10 \times 8 = 80\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is \(80 \times 2 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are 5 feet by 8 feet, so each wall has an area of \(5 \times 8 = 40\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is \(40 \times 2 = 80\) square feet.

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[160 + 80 = 240\] square feet.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[\frac{240}{20} = 12\] gallons.

Finally, since each gallon costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[12 \times 12 = 144\] dollars.

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is $144."
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the probability step by step.

1. Ellen starts with a case of 12 sodas and shakes 3 of them.
2. She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas in total.
3. Ellen's brother takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. This leaves 2 shaken sodas and 7 unshaken sodas.

Now, we need to find the probability that Ellen's friend gets one of the shaken sodas from the remaining 9 sodas.

The number of shaken sodas left is 2, and the total number of sodas left is 9.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{2}{9} \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ \frac{2}{9} \times 100 = \frac{200}{9} \approx 22.22\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately 22.22%."
"To find out how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

1. The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled:
   \[
   60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour}
   \]
   After 3 hours, it will have traveled:
   \[
   30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. Adding the distances traveled by both trains gives us the total distance between them:
   \[
   180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles}
   \]

After 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy works, considering he takes 20% of the days off.
3. Calculate the total number of people Billy can help based on his working hours.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.**

- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th is 19 days.
- Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy works.**

- Billy takes 20% of the days off, so he works 80% of the days.
- Number of days Billy works = 50 days * 80% = 50 * 0.8 = 40 days.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of people Billy can help.**

- Billy can help 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day.
- Number of people he can help per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day.
- Total number of people he can help in 40 days = 6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people.

**Final Answer:**
Billy helps 240 people."
"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry. 

First, let's calculate the number of people that the buses could carry:
- There were 12 buses.
- Each bus carried 35 people.

So, the total number of people carried by the buses is:
\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people/bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of people that the cars could carry:
- There were 20 cars.
- Each car carried 3 people.

So, the total number of people carried by the cars is:
\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people/car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Now, we add the number of people carried by the buses and the cars to find the total number of people inside the church:
\[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people inside the church is:
\[ \boxed{480} \]"
"To find out how old Jeff is, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. Mike is 24 years old.
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, so we calculate Martha's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Martha's age} = \text{Mike's age} - 4 = 24 - 4 = 20
   \]
3. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so we calculate Jeff's age as follows:

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old."
"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute

Time = Distance / Speed
Time for the biggest slide = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute

Time for the second biggest slide = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time:
Difference = Time for the biggest slide - Time for the second biggest slide
Difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

It takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and two 15-minute breaks each day. 

First, let's calculate the total time spent on breaks and lunch each day:
- Lunch: 30 minutes
- Break 1: 15 minutes
- Break 2: 15 minutes

Total time per day = 30 minutes + 15 minutes + 15 minutes = 60 minutes

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, Bobby spends 1 hour each day on his lunch and breaks.

Over 5 days, the total time spent on lunch and breaks is:
1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours

Therefore, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Sheila initially charged $85.00.
2. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract this from the initial charge:
   \[
   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]
3. She then bought a frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00. The sale price of the frying pan is:
   \[
   20.00 \times (1 - 0.20) = 20.00 \times 0.80 = 16.00
   \]
4. She also bought a set of towels on sale for 10% off $30.00. The sale price of the towels is:
   \[
   30.00 \times (1 - 0.10) = 30.00 \times 0.90 = 27.00
   \]
5. Adding the sale prices of the frying pan and the towels to the remaining balance:
   \[
   70.00 + 16.00 + 27.00 = 113.00

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. So, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation:
\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( 90 \)."

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs for her retirement and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount given her current savings rate.

1. **Calculate the annual retirement expense:**
   Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual retirement expense} = 0.40 \times \$100,000 = \$40,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the total retirement savings needed:**
   Lauren plans to live off this amount for 20 years.
   \[
   \text{Total retirement savings needed} = \$40,000 \times 20 = \$800,000
   \]

3. **Determine the amount Lauren saves each year:**
   Lauren saves 20% of her current annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual savings} = 0.20 \times \$100,000 = \$20,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of years needed to save the total amount:**
   To find out how many years it will take to save \$800,000 with annual savings of \$20,000, we divide the total savings needed by the annual savings.
   \[
   \text{Number of years} = \frac{\$800,000}{\$20,000} = 40 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her retirement."
"Marty starts with 100 centimeters of ribbon. He needs to cut this ribbon into 4 equal parts first.

1. To find the length of each of these 4 parts, we divide 100 centimeters by 4:
   \[
   \frac{100 \text{ cm}}{4} = 25 \text{ cm}
   \]
   So, each of the 4 parts is 25 centimeters long.

2. Next, each of these 25 centimeter parts needs to be divided into 5 equal parts.

3. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we divide 25 centimeters by 5:
   \[
   \frac{25 \text{ cm}}{5} = 5 \text{ cm}
   \]
   So, each of the final cuts will be 5 centimeters long.

Final answer:
\[
5 \text{ cm}
\]"
"To find the total school population, we start by noting that 40% of the school population is 240 boys. Let's denote the total school population by \( P \).

Given:
\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ P = 600 \]

So, the total school population is 600.

Since 40% of the school population is boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of the total population:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."
"To find out how much money your mom spent at the gardening shop, we need to add the cost of the pots and the cost of the garden soil, and then subtract the amount of the coupon.

The cost of the pots is $19.
The cost of the garden soil is $26.
The coupon is worth $7 off.

So, the total cost before the coupon is:
$19 + $26 = $45

After applying the coupon, the total cost is:
$45 - $7 = $38

Therefore, your mom spent $38 at the gardening shop."
"To find the average height of the heels at the party, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total height of all the heels.
2. Divide the total height by the number of women to find the average.

First, let's calculate the total height of all the heels:
- There are 3 women wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- There are 3 women wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

Adding these together gives the total height of all the heels:
\[12 + 6 = 18\] inches.

Next, we need to find the average height of the heels. There are 6 women in total, so we divide the total height by 6:
\[\frac{18}{6} = 3\] inches.

Therefore, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike.
2. Determine the total number of days in June.
3. Calculate the total miles she plans to hike per day.
4. Determine how many more miles per day she needs to hike to meet her goal.

Step 1: Total miles to hike
Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles.

Step 2: Total number of days in June
June has 30 days.

Step 3: Calculate the total miles she plans to hike per day
Soledad plans to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, she plans to hike:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/time} \times 2 \text{ times/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Step 4: Determine how many more miles per day she needs to hike
To find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, we divide the total miles by the number of days and then subtract her planned daily hike:
\[ \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]
\[ 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

60 miles/day"

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Raymond starts with $21.
2. He saves an additional $11 from his allowance.
3. He spends $5 on a comic book.
4. He spends $19 on a puzzle.

First, we add the money he saved to his initial amount:
\[ 21 + 11 = 32 \]

Next, we subtract the cost of the comic book:
\[ 32 - 5 = 27 \]

Then, we subtract the cost of the puzzle:
\[ 27 - 19 = 8 \]

So, the final amount of money Raymond has left is:
\[ 8 \]

Therefore, Raymond has $8 left."
"First, let's determine how much money Anna spent in total. She started with a budget of $16 and has $2 left after her purchases. So, the total amount spent is:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Anna had already spent $4 before buying the 2 books today. Therefore, the amount spent on the 2 books is:

\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Since she bought 2 books and they cost the same amount, the cost of each book is:

\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, each book cost $5."
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we first need to calculate the 20% increase in the number of students from last year.

Last year's enrollment: 50 students

20% of 50 students = 0.20 * 50 = 10 students

Now, we add this increase to last year's enrollment to find this year's enrollment:

50 students + 10 students = 60 students

This year, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class."
"To determine how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times, we first need to find the rate at which the light blinks. We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. 

First, we calculate the number of blinks per minute:
\[ \text{Blinks per minute} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times at this rate. We use the rate of 51 blinks per minute to find the time:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times."
"Initially, Tate has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

After buying more fish, Tate has:
- 4 + 2 = 6 male guppies
- 7 + 1 = 8 female guppies
- 3 + 2 = 5 male goldfishes
- 5 + 3 = 8 female goldfishes

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes = 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11
- Total female fishes = 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16

The difference between the number of female and male fishes is:
- 16 (female) - 11 (male) = 5

Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes."
"To solve this problem, let's break down the time each person took to complete their chores:

1. **Amalia's chore (mowing the lawn)**: 4 hours.
2. **Megan's chore (walking the dog)**: 2 hours longer than Amalia, so \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.
3. **Dior's chore (doing laundry)**: More than 4 hours longer than Amalia, so \(4 + 4 + 1 = 9\) hours (assuming ""well over 4 hours"" means at least 5 hours, and the simplest overage is 1 hour).

Now, we add up the time each person took:

- Amalia: 4 hours
- Megan: 6 hours
- Dior: 9 hours

Total time = \(4 + 6 + 9 = 19\) hours.

Therefore, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 19 hours."
"To determine the total miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the one-way distance:**
   - John drives for 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles (one way)

2. **Calculate the round trip distance:**
   - Round trip distance = 2 × One-way distance
   - Round trip distance = 2 × 140 miles = 280 miles

3. **Calculate the total distance for the month:**
   - John visits his parents twice a month.
   - Total distance = Round trip distance × Number of visits
   - Total distance = 280 miles × 2 = 560 miles

Therefore, the total miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents is 560 miles."
"Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. Over 7 days, she will walk:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, the distance Brian will walk in 7 days is:

\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers and then determine how many toys the fifth worker must produce to meet the order.

First, let's calculate the production of the first four workers:

- The first two workers produce 6 toys an hour each. Together, they produce \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.
- The next two workers produce 4 toys an hour each. Together, they produce \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.

So, the total production of the first four workers per hour is \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

Since they work for 10 hours, the total production by the first four workers is \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys.

The order requires 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. This means that the first four workers have produced \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

Since the first four workers have produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced the remaining \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked:

\[
\frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys per hour}
\]

Therefore, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog. Since Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds, Elijah's first dog weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog. So, Elijah's second dog weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the total weight of all the dogs, we add the weights of Kory's dog and Elijah's two dogs:

\[ 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is 105 pounds."
"Let's work backwards from the information given:

1. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris originally had \(9 + 7 = 16\) stickers.
2. Luis gave all of his stickers to Kris, so Luis had 16 stickers before giving them to Kris.
3. Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris, so the 16 stickers he had were the other half. Therefore, Luis originally had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.
4. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Seth originally had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

Therefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of M&M that John has:

3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces

Next, we need to find out how many M&M he has in total:

30 ounces * 30 M&M per ounce = 900 M&M

Now, if he puts 10 M&M in each small bag, we can calculate the number of small bags he can make:

900 M&M / 10 M&M per small bag = 90 small bags

Therefore, John can make 90 small bags of M&M."
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate half of the circumference of the earth.
2. Divide this distance by the distance Alfie flies each day to find the number of days.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the daily distance:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."
"To find out how fast the fastest car can go, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use that speed to find the speed of the fastest car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. So, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
\[ 120 \text{ mph} \times 5 = 600 \text{ mph} \]

Next, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, the speed of the fastest car is:
\[ 600 \text{ mph} \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ mph} \]

Therefore, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour."
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old two years ago. Therefore, Vince is now 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

Vince is now 9 years old."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted.
2. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, Madeline also painted \( A \) eggs.
3. Let \( C \) be the number of eggs Camden painted.
4. Since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, Sarah painted \( 30 - C \) eggs.
5. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so \( C = (30 - C) + 12 \).

Now, let's solve for \( C \):
\[ C = 30 - C + 12 \]
\[ 2C = 42 \]
\[ C = 21 \]

So, Camden painted 21 eggs. Since Sarah painted \( 30 - C \) eggs:
\[ \text{Sarah's eggs} = 30 - 21 = 9 \]

Now, we know the total number of eggs painted by Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah is 56. We can write the equation:
\[ A + A + C + (30 - C) = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Arnold painted 13 eggs. Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

Final answer:
8"
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Since each group of crayons will be placed in a box, Nik will need 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \times 8 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

To convert the total weight from ounces to pounds, we use the conversion factor that 1 pound = 16 ounces:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400}{16} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much of the tree can be turned into logs. John can make logs out of 80% of the 80-foot tree:

Next, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs can be cut from the 64 feet of usable wood:

\[ \frac{64}{4} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

From each log, John can cut 5 planks. Therefore, the total number of planks he can get from all the logs is:

\[ 16 \times 5 = 80 \text{ planks} \]

If he sells each plank for $1.2, the total amount he makes is:

\[ 80 \times 1.2 = 96 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Grandma to walk the entire 3 miles, given the information about her speeds on the beach and the sidewalk, and the time spent on the beach.

1. **Determine the speed on the beach:**
   - Grandma spends 40 minutes walking 2 miles on the beach.
   - Speed on the beach = Distance / Time = 2 miles / (40 minutes / 60 minutes per hour) = 2 miles / (2/3 hours) = 3 miles per hour.

2. **Determine the speed on the sidewalk:**
   - The speed on the sidewalk is twice the speed on the beach.
   - Speed on the sidewalk = 2 * 3 miles per hour = 6 miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - Distance on the sidewalk = 1 mile.
   - Time on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed = 1 mile / 6 miles per hour = 1/6 hours.
   - Convert this time to minutes: (1/6) * 60 minutes = 10 minutes.

4. **Calculate the total time for the entire walk:**
   - Time on the beach = 40 minutes.
   - Time on the sidewalk = 10 minutes.
   - Total time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate how much Jane has saved so far.
2. Determine how much more she needs to save to reach $60.
3. Calculate how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining amount.

Step 1: Calculate how much Jane has saved so far.
Jane saves $4 every week. Over 8 weeks, she has saved:
\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 2: Determine how much more she needs to save to reach $60.
The total amount she wants to save is $60. She has already saved $32, so she needs:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 3: Calculate how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining amount.
Since she saves $4 each week, the number of weeks needed to save $28 is:
\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane \(\boxed{7}\) more weeks to save a total of $60."

"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob originally has. We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the original number of marbles Bob has:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtract 24 from both sides to solve for the original number of marbles:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} = 60 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Original number of marbles} = 36 \]

Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, we subtract 10 from his original number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 26 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water that would allow Donny to drink the mixture after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle.

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug of water as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the resulting mixture must be at least 40 degrees for him to drink it.

The key here is to understand that the temperature of the mixture will be a weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs of water. However, since we are only given the volume of water from each mug and not the total volume of the mixture, we can simplify the problem by considering the temperature of the second mug as the only unknown that needs to be determined.

The condition for Donny to drink the water is that the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees. Since we are only pouring 1 ounce from the second mug and 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug, the temperature of the second mug must be at least 40 degrees to ensure the mixture is at least 40 degrees.

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the second mug of water must be 40 degrees.

Final numerical answer:
40 degrees"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over the three-week period and then add these to the initial numbers.

1. **Initial number of cows**: 50
2. **Initial number of chickens**: 20
3. **Cows added per day**: 20
4. **Chickens added per day**: 10
5. **Number of days in three weeks**: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Now, calculate the total number of cows and chickens added over 21 days:

- **Total cows added**: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
- **Total chickens added**: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Now, add these to the initial numbers:

- **Total cows**: 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows
- **Total chickens**: 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

Finally, add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals:

- **Total animals**: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

**Final numerical answer:**

"First, let's calculate the total cost for 4 packs of bagels before the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, and Russell orders 4 packs, so the total cost is:
\[ 4 \times \$10.00 = \$40.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final cost:
\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total. Since each pack contains 9 bagels and he orders 4 packs, the total number of bagels is:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, to find the cost per single bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \text{ per bagel} \]

So, the cost per single bagel is:
\[ \$1.00 \]"

1. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means Gomer ate \(23 - 5 = 18\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

2. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means it takes \(6 - 3 = 3\) potatoes to make \(3 - 1 = 2\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we need to determine how many sets of 2 scoops are in 18 scoops.
   - There are \(18 \div 2 = 9\) sets of 2 scoops in 18 scoops.

4. Since each set of 2 scoops requires 3 potatoes, for 9 sets, we need \(9 \times 3 = 27\) potatoes.

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes."
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs he consumes over the 60 days.

1. For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs for the first 30 days is:
   \[
   3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs}
   \]

2. For the next 30 days, Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs for the next 30 days is:
   \[
   5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs}
   \]

3. Adding the eggs from both periods gives us the total number of eggs for 60 days:
   \[
   90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs}
   \]

4. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens:
   \[
   \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens}
   \]

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of red jellybeans.
2. Calculate the total number of green and red jellybeans.
3. Subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans to find the number of blue jellybeans.

Step 1: Jess can see that there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans. Therefore, the number of red jellybeans is:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Step 2: The total number of green and red jellybeans is:
\[ 17 + 34 = 51 \]

Step 3: The total number of jellybeans in the jar is 60. Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is:
\[ 60 - 51 = 9 \]

So, the number of blue jellybeans is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"Tim grows 5 trees. Each year, he collects 6 lemons from each tree. 

In one year, the total number of lemons he collects is:
5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons

In a decade (10 years), the total number of lemons he collects is:
30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
300 lemons"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the following equation to find the number of men and women:

Let the number of men be \(5x\) and the number of women be \(9x\). The total number of passengers is the sum of men and women, so:

\[5x + 9x = 84\]

\[14x = 84\]

\[x = 6\]

So, the number of men is \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\) and the number of women is \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\).

If 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

\[54 - 20 = 34\]

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day.
2. Calculate the number of sunflowers sold in 3 days.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day.**

- Faraday earns $26 from selling sunflowers per day.
- Each sunflower is sold for $2.

So, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:
\[ \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of sunflowers sold in 3 days.**

- Faraday sells 13 sunflowers per day.
- We need to find out how many sunflowers he sells in 3 days.

So, the number of sunflowers sold in 3 days is:
\[ 13 \times 3 = 39 \]

Therefore, Faraday was able to sell 39 sunflowers after 3 days."
"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Since each rock costs $5, we divide $100 by $5:

\[ \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Adam can buy 20 rocks.

Next, we need to find out how many rocks he sells. He sells 60% of his inventory, so we calculate 60% of 20:

\[ 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \]

Adam sells 12 rocks.

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling these 12 rocks. Each rock is sold for $7, so:

\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \]

Adam earns $84 from selling the rocks.

To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to subtract the revenue from the initial investment. Adam's initial investment is $100, and his revenue is $84, so the loss is:

\[ 100 - 84 = 16 \]

Therefore, Adam loses $16."
"To determine how many days it will take Lauren to create all the picture scenes, we need to calculate the total number of days required for each size of picture scene and then sum these values.

1. **Large-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for large-sized scenes is \( \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) days.

2. **Medium-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for medium-sized scenes is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) days.

3. **Small-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for small-sized scenes is \( \frac{49}{7} = 7 \) days.

Now, we sum the days required for each type of picture scene:
\[ 9 \text{ days} + 6 \text{ days} + 7 \text{ days} = 22 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Lauren \(\boxed{22}\) days to create all of the picture scenes."
"Chatty prepared three dozen eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, three dozen eggs equal 36 eggs.

To find out how many eggs each child receives, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children:

36 eggs ÷ 4 children = 9 eggs per child

Each child receives 9 eggs."
"Jen has 3 fish, and each fish needs $1 worth of food a day. 

In the month of May, there are 31 days.

So, the total amount spent on food for all the fish in May is calculated as follows:

3 fish * $1/day/fish * 31 days = $93

Jen spends $93 on food for her fish in the month of May."
"Patricia initially had 30 roses. After giving 24 roses to her mother, she had:

30 - 24 = 6 roses left.

Then, she bought 15 more roses, so she now has:

6 + 15 = 21 roses.

Patricia now has 21 roses."
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then divide the total distance by the total time.

First, let's calculate the total distance:
- Distance for the first part of the trip: 110 miles
- Distance for the second part of the trip: 140 miles
- Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Next, let's calculate the total time:
- Time for the first part of the trip: 2 hours
- Time for the second part of the trip: 3 hours
- Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, we can find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{250 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the probability of winning with the second ticket.
2. Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners.

First, we know the probability of winning with the first ticket is 20%, or 0.20. The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning with the second ticket is:

\[ 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

Next, we calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners. Since the events are independent, we multiply the probabilities of each event:

\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is:

\[ \boxed{12\%} \]"
"First, let's determine how many seashells Carlos collected. We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, Carlos collected:

\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \text{ seashells} \]

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. Therefore, Carrey collected:

\[ \frac{22}{2} = 11 \text{ seashells} \]

Now, we can find the total number of seashells collected by adding the seashells collected by each person:

\[ 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \text{ seashells} \]

They decided to divide all the seashells equally among themselves. Since there are 3 people, each person will get:

\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ seashells} \]

So, each person gets \(\boxed{20}\) seashells."
"Mason eats 4 carrots each day on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so he eats:

\[ 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \]

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So for the weekend, he eats:

\[ 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Adding the carrots he eats during the weekdays and the weekend gives:

\[ 20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots} \]

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots a week."
"The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes = 0.60 * 5 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes long.

Now, to find the total length of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs:

5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes

The total cassette time is 13 minutes."
"Linus buys each mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the original price, which means he sells each device for $40.

First, let's calculate the profit from selling one device:
\[ \text{Profit per device} = \text{Selling price} - \text{Buying price} = 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Next, we calculate the total profit from selling the devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday:
- He bought 2 devices on Monday, so the profit from Monday's devices is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]
- He bought 4 devices on Tuesday, so the profit from Tuesday's devices is:
\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Adding the profits from both days:
\[ 40 + 80 = 120 \]

Therefore, the total profit Linus earned after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Isabel's height is given as 7 feet.
2. Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned's height is:
   \[
   7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so Carl's height is:
   \[
   5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet}
   \]
4. Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so the length of Carl's cane is:
   \[
   \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is 3 feet."
"To satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required based on the information given.

1. Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
2. Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required would be:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles they need to produce, we subtract the current production from the total required:
\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce an additional 7300 bottles of juice to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people."

"To find out how many tax reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and Thursday and Friday from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week: 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday: 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday: 2136

Now, let's calculate the reports received on Wednesday:

5168 (total reports) - 1907 (Monday and Tuesday) - 2136 (Thursday and Friday) = 1125

So, the IRS received 1125 tax reports on Wednesday."
"Abraham initially owns 80 square meters of land.

1. He sold half of the land for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. So, the price per square meter for this sale is:
\[ \frac{50}{40} = 1.25 \text{ dollars per square meter} \]

2. After selling 40 square meters, he has 40 square meters left. He then sold 1/4 of the remaining land for $30. One-fourth of 40 square meters is 10 square meters. So, the price per square meter for this sale is:
\[ \frac{30}{10} = 3 \text{ dollars per square meter} \]

3. After selling another 10 square meters, he has 30 square meters left. He sold the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter. The money earned from this sale is:
\[ 30 \times 3 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

4. Adding up all the money earned from the sales:
\[ 50 + 30 + 90 = 170 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Abraham will be able to earn $170 after selling all his unused land."
"To find Geb's age, we start by calculating half of Haley's age and then subtract 10 from that value.

Haley's age = 26 years

Half of Haley's age = 26 / 2 = 13 years

Geb's age = Half of Haley's age - 10 = 13 - 10 = 3 years

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old."
"Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. If he goes out three times a day, the number of face masks he uses per day is:

\[ 2 \text{ masks/go} \times 3 \text{ go/day} = 6 \text{ masks/day} \]

Over 2 days, the number of face masks he uses is:

\[ 6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks} \]

Therefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen equals 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei: \(5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\) eggs.

To find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs hidden: \(36 - 27 = 9\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
9 eggs are still hidden in the yard."
"First, let's determine the number of apartments in the third complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have:

\[200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments}\]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. To find the number of apartments in the third complex, we calculate 60% of 400 and add it to 400:

\[0.60 \times 400 = 240\]

So, the third complex has:

\[400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments}\]

Now, let's calculate the total number of apartments John collects from all three complexes:

\[200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments}\]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, so the total number of collections per week is:

\[1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections}\]

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so the total amount of money he makes in a week is:

\[3120 \times 0.40 = 1248\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[1248\]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **5-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. Let's denote the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces as \(x\). Therefore, the 8-year-old tree produces \(x - 200\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old avocado tree**: Doesn't produce any fruit.
6. **10-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we need to find the value of \(x\) (the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces). According to the problem, the 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than the 10-year-old tree, so:
\[ x - 200 = \text{fruits produced by 8-year-old tree} \]
Since the 8-year-old tree produces 350 fruits, we have:
\[ x - 200 = 350 \]
\[ x = 350 + 200 \]
\[ x = 550 \]

So, a 10-year-old tree produces 550 fruits.

Now, let's sum up the total number of fruits produced over the 10 years:
\[ 50 + 150 + 350 + 0 + 550 + 1000 = 2100 \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:
\[ 2100 \]"
"Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100, which is $100 * 1/5 = $20.

Jack originally had $100, so after receiving $20 from Sophia, he now has $100 + $20 = $120.

Therefore, Jack has $120 now."
"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters, and the length of the red rope as \( R \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we can express \( Y \) in terms of \( B \) using the second relationship:
\[ Y = B + 7 \]

Now, we substitute \( R \) and \( Y \) in terms of \( B \) into the third equation:
\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 5 \]

Now, we can find \( R \) using the first relationship:
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the initial amounts of money:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Define the amount given to their sister:**
   - Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their sister.

3. **Express the remaining amounts after giving money to their sister:**
   - Ronnie's remaining money: \(5 - x\)
   - Rissa's remaining money: \(15 - x\)

4. **Set up the equation based on the given condition:**
   - Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her money after giving \(x\) dollars to their sister.
   - Therefore, \(15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15\)

5. **Solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
   \]
   \[
   15 - x = 12
   \]
   \[
   x = 15 - 12
   \]
   \[
   x = 3
   \]

6. **Calculate the remaining amount of money Ronnie has:**
   - Ronnie's remaining money: \(5 - x = 5 - 3 = 2\)

Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Given that the mural uses 12 pints of paint in total and that half of the mural is yellow, we can determine the amount of yellow paint used:

\[ \text{Amount of yellow paint} = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Since the mural has equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, and the total amount of paint used for these three colors is the remaining half of the mural:

\[ \text{Total amount of red, white, and purple paint} = 12 - 6 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we divide the total amount of these three colors by 3:

\[ \text{Amount of red paint} = \frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, the number of pints of red paint used is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is:

\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total area of the house is:

\[ 3160 \text{ square feet} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cloud puffs Alice counts each day and then sum them up for the five days.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
2. **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Monday, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the puffs from each day:
\[ 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 \]

Adding these together:
\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]
\[ 9 + 12 = 21 \]
\[ 21 + 24 = 45 \]
\[ 45 + 48 = 93 \]

So, at the end of the week, Alice will have counted a total of 93 cloud puffs."
"First, let's determine the number of pods in the special size box. The regular box contains 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods.

\[ 100 \text{ pods} + (20\% \times 100 \text{ pods}) = 100 \text{ pods} + 20 \text{ pods} = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. To find the cost per pod in the special size box, we divide the total cost by the number of pods:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, the cost per cycle is $0.10. To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we divide $1 by the cost per cycle:

\[ \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per cycle}} = 10 \text{ cycles} \]

Therefore, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1 with the new box."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Withdrawal**: Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills.
   - Since each bill is $20, the number of 20 dollar bills he withdraws is \( \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \) bills.

2. **Losing Bills**: Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   - Remaining bills: \( 50 - 10 = 40 \) bills.

3. **Using Half for a Bill**: He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   - Half of 40 bills is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) bills.
   - Cost of the bill: \( 20 \times 20 = 400 \) dollars.

4. **Tripling the Money**: After paying for the bill, he triples the remaining money.
   - Remaining money after paying for the bill: \( 1000 - 400 = 600 \) dollars.
   - Tripling the money: \( 600 \times 3 = 1800 \) dollars.

5. **Converting to 5 Dollar Bills**: He converts all his money to 5 dollar bills.
   - Number of 5 dollar bills: \( \frac{1800}{5} = 360 \) bills.

**Final Answer**: Thomas has 360 five-dollar bills."
"In the first half:
- Team A scores 4 goals.
- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, which is 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half:
- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals.
- Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, which is 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

Total number of goals scored in the match:
- Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
- Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

Total goals = 6 (Team A) + 10 (Team B) = 16 goals

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the length of the chalk after Monday.
2. Calculate how much chalk is used each day.
3. Determine how many days the chalk will last before it needs to be recycled.

**Step 1: Determine the length of the chalk after Monday.**

The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk and used 45% of it on Monday. So, the remaining chalk is:
\[ 5 \times (1 - 0.45) = 5 \times 0.55 = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]

**Step 2: Calculate how much chalk is used each day.**

The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. So, the amount of chalk used each day is:
\[ 0.20 \times \text{current length of chalk} \]

**Step 3: Determine how many days the chalk will last before it needs to be recycled.**

We need to find out how many days it will take for the chalk to be reduced to 2 inches or less. We can do this by iteratively subtracting the daily usage from the current length of the chalk until it is 2 inches or less.

- **Day 1:**
  \[ 2.75 - 0.20 \times 2.75 = 2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20 \text{ inches} \]

- **Day 2:**
  \[ 2.20 - 0.20 \times 2.20 = 2.20 - 0.44 = 1.76 \text{ inches} \]

Since 1.76 inches is less than 2 inches, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk on the second day.

Therefore, the teacher has \(\boxed{2}\) days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk."
"To find out how many students are not on varsity, we first need to calculate the number of boys and girls who are on varsity.

- One-third of the girls are on varsity: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) girls.
- One-fourth of the boys are on varsity: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \) boys.

Now, we add the number of boys and girls on varsity to find the total number of students on varsity: \( 4 + 3 = 7 \).

The total number of students in the class is \( 12 + 12 = 24 \).

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students: \( 24 - 7 = 17 \).

Therefore, the number of students not on varsity is 17."
"Mike bought 5 face masks.

Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. So, we calculate thrice the number of masks Mike bought first:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of teeth drilled:**
   - The dentist drills 4 teeth.

2. **Determine the number of teeth capped:**
   - The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills.
   - Therefore, the number of teeth capped = 4 (drilled) + 7 = 11 teeth.

3. **Calculate the total number of teeth fixed:**
   - Teeth fixed = Teeth drilled + Teeth capped = 4 + 11 = 15 teeth.

4. **Calculate the percentage of teeth fixed:**
   - Total teeth = 30
   - Teeth fixed = 15
   - Percentage of teeth fixed = (Teeth fixed / Total teeth) * 100
   - Percentage of teeth fixed = (15 / 30) * 100 = 0.5 * 100 = 50%

The final numerical answer is:
50%"
"First, we need to determine how much milk Mr. Marcellus returned to the company. He returned 2/5 of the 4000 gallons of milk.

\[ \text{Amount of milk returned} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we calculate the refund amount by multiplying the amount of milk returned by the cost per gallon.

\[ \text{Refund amount} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$5600 \]

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of \(\boxed{5600}\)."
"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, we can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 5(C + 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7) \]

Next, we solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}C + \frac{35}{3} \]
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school gets.

First, we know that Bob can buy 100 books for $500. To find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy with $27000, we divide $27000 by $500:

\[ \frac{27000}{500} = 54 \]

This means Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books. Since each set is 100 books, the total number of books he can buy is:

\[ 54 \times 100 = 5400 \]

Now, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school gets:

\[ \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \]

So, Bob can buy 1800 books per school.

"Let's break down the sequence of events to determine how many apples Newton brought home.

1. Initially, two apples fell out of the tree.
2. Newton picked up the two apples and put one in his pocket, throwing the other one into the tree, which caused 5 more apples to fall out.
3. Newton picked up these 5 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree, which caused 6 more apples to fall out.
4. Newton picked up all of the remaining apples and went home to make a pie.

Now, let's count the apples:

- Initially, 2 apples fell.
- Newton put 1 in his pocket and threw 1 into the tree, so 5 more fell, making it 2 + 5 = 7 apples.
- Newton then put 4 of these 5 in his pocket and threw 1 at the tree, causing 6 more to fall, making it 7 + 6 = 13 apples.
- Newton picked up all 13 apples and went home.

So, the total number of apples Newton brought home is 13."

First, we calculate the number of 50 kg bags required:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 17 \text{ bags} \times \$18/\text{bag} = \$306 \]

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's order is:
\[ \$306 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices and pepperoni pizza slices that Kate's friends will eat.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

So, for 6 friends, the total number of slices eaten will be:
- Cheese pizza slices: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices}\)
- Pepperoni pizza slices: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices}\)

Now, we need to determine how many whole cheese and pepperoni pizzas are required to provide these slices.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- Therefore, the number of cheese pizzas needed is \( \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \).

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- Therefore, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is \( \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \).

Adding the number of cheese and pepperoni pizzas together, Kate needs to buy:
- \(3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas}\).

So, Sam ran a total of 19 miles this week."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Snowballs Built Per Hour**: Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour.

2. **Snowballs Melted Per 15 Minutes**: 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 fifteen-minute intervals in an hour, the number of snowballs that melt in an hour is \(2 \times 4 = 8\).

3. **Net Snowballs Built Per Hour**: The net number of snowballs Jay builds in an hour is the number he builds minus the number that melt, which is \(20 - 8 = 12\).

4. **Snowballs Needed**: Jay needs 60 snowballs.

5. **Time Calculation**: To find out how many hours it will take to build 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net number of snowballs built per hour. So, \(60 \div 12 = 5\) hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

**Final Answer:**

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Jim's age at the time Digimon came out and then find out how old he is now.

1. First, we need to find out how many years ago Digimon came out. Since John is 28 now and he was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out, we can set up the following relationship:

Let \( J \) be Jim's age when Digimon came out, and \( 2J \) be John's age at that time. The difference in their ages remains constant over time, so we can write:

\[ 28 - 2J = J - J \]
\[ 28 - 2J = 0 \]
\[ 28 = 3J \]
\[ J = \frac{28}{3} \]
\[ J = 9.33 \]

So, Jim was approximately 9.33 years old when Digimon came out.

2. Now, we need to find out how many years have passed since then. Since John is 28 now and he was 2J (which is 18.67) when Digimon came out, the number of years that have passed is:

\[ 28 - 18.67 = 9.33 \]

3. Therefore, Jim's current age is:

\[ 9.33 + 9.33 = 18.67 \]

Since we typically round to the nearest whole number in age calculations, Jim is currently 19 years old.

1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

They all ate a total of 6 slices of apple."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 1 bulk pack = 50
   - Bandages at the end of the first day: \(50 - 38 = 12\)

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: \(38 - 10 = 28\)
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \(12 - 28 = -16\)
   - Since it's not possible to have a negative number of bandages, this means they ran out of bandages and needed to order more. They ordered a bulk pack of 50 bandages to cover the deficit and the usage for the second day.
   - Bandages at the end of the second day after ordering: \(50 - 28 = 22\)

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages ordered: 2 bulk packs = 100
   - Bandages used: Half a bulk pack = 25
   - Bandages at the end of the third day: \(22 + 100 - 25 = 97\)

However, the problem states that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means we need to adjust our initial count to match this condition.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as \(x\).

- After the first day: \(x + 50 - 38 = x + 12\)
- After the second day: \(x + 12 + 50 - 28 = x + 34\)
- After the third day: \(x + 34 + 100 - 25 = x + 109\)

We know that at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left, so:
\[x + 109 = 78\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[x = 78 - 109 = -31\]

Since the initial number of bandages cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation should be that the initial number of bandages plus the bandages ordered and used should equal 78 at the end of the third day.

Revisiting the steps, we see that the initial number of bandages plus the net addition from orders and usage should equal 78. The correct calculation is:
\[x + 109 = 78\]
\[x = 78 - 109 = -31\]

This indicates an error in the problem setup or interpretation. Given the problem constraints, the correct initial number of bandages should be re-evaluated to fit the conditions. The correct initial number of bandages, considering the problem constraints, is:

\[x = 78 - 109 = -31\]

However, since the initial number of bandages cannot be negative, the problem setup might need re-evaluation. Assuming the problem is correctly stated, the initial number of bandages is:

\[x = 78 - 109 = -31\]

But practically, the initial number of bandages should be:

"To determine the total cost of May's hair cut and color, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut and the cost of the color separately, and then add them together.

1. **Cost of the color**: The cost for the color is a flat rate of $40.

2. **Cost of the haircut**: The cost for the haircut is $30 per inch. Her hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, which means the length of her hair was reduced by 2 inches. Therefore, the cost of the haircut is:
   \[
   2 \text{ inches} \times \$30/\text{inch} = \$60
   \]

3. **Total cost**: Adding the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut together, we get:
   \[
   \$40 + \$60 = \$100
   \]

Therefore, the total cost of May's cut and color is:

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days Jen works in April.
2. Calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate.
3. Add the additional $10 for complete attendance.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of days Jen works in April.**
Since April has exactly 4 weeks and Jen works 6 days a week, the total number of days she works in April is:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ days} \]

**Step 2: Calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate.**
Jen's hourly rate is $1.5, and she works 7.5 hours a day. Therefore, her daily earnings are:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$11.25/\text{day} \]
For 24 days, her total earnings are:
\[ 24 \text{ days} \times \$11.25/\text{day} = \$270 \]

**Step 3: Add the additional $10 for complete attendance.**
Since Jen did not incur any absences, she receives the additional $10 for complete attendance. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:
\[ \$270 + \$10 = \$280 \]

**Final Answer:**
\[ \$280 \]"
"To calculate how much money Jason earned, we need to multiply the number of times he performed each task by the amount he earns for that task and then sum these amounts.

1. For emptying the dishwasher: $0.50 per time, and he did it 6 times.
   \[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]

2. For doing his laundry: $3.00 per time, and he did it once.
   \[ 1 \times 3.00 = 3.00 \]

3. For cleaning his room: $1.50 per time, and he did it once.
   \[ 1 \times 1.50 = 1.50 \]

4. For taking the trash to the curb: $0.75 per time, and he did it twice.
   \[ 2 \times 0.75 = 1.50 \]

Now, we add all these amounts together to find the total amount Jason earned:
\[ 3.00 + 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 = 9.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 9.00 \]"
"Each whale has 40 gallons of blood. A shark has three times as much blood as a whale, so a shark has:

\[ 40 \text{ gallons} \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

If we have ten sharks, the total amount of blood for ten sharks would be:

\[ 120 \text{ gallons/shark} \times 10 \text{ sharks} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

1200 gallons"
"To calculate the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up the number of people who entered at different times.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we add all these numbers together:

\[50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320\]

Therefore, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack contains 5 pens, the total number of red pens is:

\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

She also bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. Therefore, the number of black pens is:

\[ 2 \times 25 \text{ red pens} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

To find the total number of pens, we add the number of red pens and black pens together:

\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

Alain has \(\boxed{75}\) pens."
"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles for $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 20 bottles of cognac:

\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount spent:

\[ 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount John spends on everything is:

\[ \boxed{2400} \]"
"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted:
- 20 White Oak trees
- Twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees

On the second day, he planted:
- 10 more White Oak trees than the first day, which is \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees
- \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days:
- Total White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\)
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: \(40 + 50 = 90\)

Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Fred initially made 24 gallons of root beer.
2. His children drank 4 gallons, leaving 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.
3. His wife spilled 7 gallons, leaving 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.
4. His friend Ronnie took 5 gallons, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people (including Fred) showed up for the party. The remaining root beer is 8 gallons, which will be shared equally among the 3 people.

To find out how much each person gets, we divide the remaining root beer by the number of people:

8 gallons / 3 people = 8/3 gallons per person

So, each person gets 8/3 gallons of root beer, which is approximately 2.67 gallons.

The final numerical answer is:
8/3 gallons or approximately 2.67 gallons per person."
"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \( 8 \).

"To find the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes, we can break down the problem into steps.

1. Calculate the number of fish with red stripes:
   - One-third of the fish have red stripes.
   - Number of fish with red stripes = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \).

2. Calculate the number of remaining fish after removing the fish with red stripes:
   - Remaining fish = Total fish - Fish with red stripes = 66 - 22 = 44.

3. Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish:
   - Five-elevenths of the remaining fish have blue stripes.
   - Number of fish with blue stripes = \( \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \).

4. Calculate the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes:
   - Total fish with red and blue stripes = Fish with red stripes + Fish with blue stripes = 22 + 20 = 42.

Therefore, the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 42."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Amy originally had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so that's \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
2. She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so that's \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.
3. In total, before any theft or usage, Amy had \(8 + 18 = 26\) eyeshadow colors.

Now, let's account for the changes:

4. Her sister steals one of the palettes, which had 4 colors. So, \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors left.
5. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each set has 6 colors, half of that is \(6 / 2 = 3\) colors. So, she uses 3 colors from one set, leaving \(18 - 3 = 15\) colors from that set.
6. Adding the remaining colors from the other two sets, we have \(15 + 4 = 19\) colors from the makeup sets.
7. Adding the remaining palette, we have \(19 + 4 = 22\) colors in total.

So, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
22"

The floor to ceiling height on the first floor is thrice Mattison's height:
\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we subtract the first floor's ceiling height from the total height of the house:
\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:
\[ 240 \text{ inches} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many shells team Alphas found. Since they found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

This means that 280 shells were found by team Alphas. Now, we need to find out how many shells were left for the other two teams:

\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Next, we calculate how many shells team The finders found, which is 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

So, team The finders found 252 shells. To find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the number of shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells:

\[ 420 - 252 = 168 \]

Therefore, team Gogetters found 168 shells.

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

First, we know the total number of dogs is 4, and the average miles walked per day is 3 miles. Therefore, the total miles walked by all dogs combined is:
\[ 4 \text{ dogs} \times 3 \text{ miles/dog} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the miles walked by the first three dogs:
- The first dog walks 1 mile.
- The second dog walks 4 miles.
- The third dog walks 3 miles.

Adding these together gives:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day."
"First, we calculate the amount of the loan John gets by taking 40% of the value of his house:

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, we determine how much of the loan he uses to pay off his debts by taking 60% of the loan amount:

\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Finally, we subtract the amount used to pay debts from the total loan amount to find out how much money he has leftover:

\[ \text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

Therefore, the amount of money John had leftover after paying his debts is:

"To find Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines. She sells them at 11/8 of the price she bought them for. Given that she bought the magazines at $72, we can calculate the selling price as follows:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11 \times 72}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{792}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the buying price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting = 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much as the low setting, so it removes 2 liters per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting = 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.

3. **High Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much as the medium setting, so it removes 4 liters per day.
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on high setting = 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Now, we sum the water removed at each setting:
- Total water removed = 3 liters (low) + 6 liters (medium) + 20 liters (high) = 29 liters.

The total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."

"First, we need to determine the capacity of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, we can calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[ \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:

\[ \text{Total capacity of John's school} = 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ students} \]

The capacity of Ali's school is given as 120 students. Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is:

\[ \text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students} \]

The combined capacity of both schools is 150 students."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen will owe his sister including the 2% interest.

The principal amount Stephen borrowed is $300. The interest is 2% of $300, which is calculated as follows:
\[ 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen will owe is:
\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in 11 months is:
\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he has already paid from the total amount he owes:
\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:

"To determine how many diapers Jordan changes per day, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day.
2. Since there are 2 children, the total number of diaper changes per day is \(5 \times 2 = 10\).
3. Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so she changes \(10 \div 2 = 5\) diapers per day.
4. Therefore, Jordan changes the other half, which is also \(5\) diapers per day.

So, Jordan changes \(\boxed{5}\) diapers per day."
"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the jar.
2. Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans, considering the packing efficiency.
3. Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.
4. Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans.
5. Compare Tim's guess to the true number of red jelly beans.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.**

The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall. The volume \( V \) of the jar is:
\[ V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans.**

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume \( V_{\text{eff}} \) is:
\[ V_{\text{eff}} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 3: Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.**

Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches. The total number of jelly beans \( N \) that can fit in the jar is:
\[ N = \frac{V_{\text{eff}}}{\text{volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans.**

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red. Therefore, the estimated number of red jelly beans \( N_{\text{red}} \) is:
\[ N_{\text{red}} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

**Step 5: Compare Tim's guess to the true number of red jelly beans.**

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between Tim's guess and the true number is:
\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

Therefore, Tim was \(\boxed{36}\) jelly beans off."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the bus had 20 people on board.
2. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the number of people on the bus is now:
   \[
   20 + 40 = 60
   \]
3. At the second stop, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who entered at the first stop entered again. So, the number of people who entered at the second stop is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30
   \]
   Therefore, the number of people on the bus after the second stop is:
   \[
   60 + 30 = 90
   \]
4. At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the number of people on the bus after the third stop is:
   \[
   90 \times 2 = 180
   \]
5. The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find out how many more people are needed to fill the bus, we subtract the current number of people on the bus from the bus's capacity:
   \[
   200 - 180 = 20

"First, let's calculate the cost of one visit after the increase. The original cost of one visit is $2. An increase of 150% means the cost is increased by 150% of $2.

150% of $2 = 1.5 * $2 = $3

So, the new cost of one visit is $2 (original cost) + $3 (increase) = $5.

Pauline visits the museum three times a year. For 5 years, the cost per visit is $2, so the total cost for one year is:
3 visits/year * $2/visit = $6/year

For 5 years, the total cost is:
5 years * $6/year = $30

After 5 years, the cost per visit increased to $5. For the next 3 years, the cost per visit is $5, so the total cost for one year is:
3 visits/year * $5/visit = $15/year

For 3 years, the total cost is:
3 years * $15/year = $45

Adding the costs for the first 5 years and the next 3 years, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is:
$30 + $45 = $75

Therefore, Pauline spent a total of $75 on all visits to the museum."
"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students who can try the escape room.
2. Determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed.
3. Calculate the total time required for all groups to try the escape room.

First, we know that there are 10 students in each of the 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th) who can try the escape room. Therefore, the total number of students is:
\[ 10 \text{ students/grade} \times 4 \text{ grades} = 40 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed from these 40 students:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students/group}} = 5 \text{ groups} \]

Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room. Since all groups use their full 45 minutes and there are 5 groups, the total time required for all groups to try the escape room is:
\[ 5 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 225 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take \(\boxed{225}\) minutes for everyone to try the escape room."
"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the wooden tables and the roof frames separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the wooden tables:
- John made 4 wooden tables.
- Each table costs $20.
- Therefore, the total cost for the wooden tables is \(4 \times 20 = 80\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the roof frames:
- John made 2 roof frames.
- Each roof frame costs $10.
- Therefore, the total cost for the roof frames is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the wooden tables and the roof frames to find the total amount Ali has to pay:
- Total cost = Cost of wooden tables + Cost of roof frames
- Total cost = \(80 + 20 = 100\) dollars.

Therefore, Ali has to pay John a total of $100."
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we calculate:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."

1. **Determine the amount of ground beef needed:**
   - Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef.
   - He wants to make 80 meatballs.
   - Therefore, the amount of ground beef needed is \( \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds of ground beef} \).

2. **Calculate the amount of secret seasoning needed:**
   - Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for every pound of ground beef.
   - Since he needs 5 pounds of ground beef, the amount of secret seasoning needed is \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \).

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning to make 80 meatballs."

1. For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute:
   \[
   16 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.25/\text{minute} = \$4.00
   \]

2. For the remaining minutes (36 - 16 = 20 minutes), the cost is $0.20 per minute:
   \[
   20 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.20/\text{minute} = \$4.00
   \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost:
\[
\$4.00 + \$4.00 = \$8.00
\]

Therefore, the total cost for a 36-minute call is \$8.00."
"On Monday, it rained 2 inches. 

Twice of Monday's total is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) inches.

Therefore, the rainfall on Tuesday will be 5 inches."
"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly makes as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be written as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

The total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is the sum of the number of cupcakes and the number of brownies. Since each of the 5 people in the class gets 2 treats, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

So, we have:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]
\[ C = 3 \]

Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To calculate the total cost for Karen, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted price for both a manicure and a pedicure.
2. Calculate the cost of adding nail art to all 20 nails (10 on each hand).
3. Add the discounted price of the services to the cost of the nail art.

**Step 1: Calculate the discounted price for both a manicure and a pedicure.**

- The original price for a manicure is $35.
- The original price for a pedicure is $40.
- The discount is 20%, so the discount amount for each service is 20% of the original price.

Discount for manicure: \( 35 \times 0.20 = 7 \)
Discounted price for manicure: \( 35 - 7 = 28 \)

Discount for pedicure: \( 40 \times 0.20 = 8 \)
Discounted price for pedicure: \( 40 - 8 = 32 \)

Total discounted price for both services: \( 28 + 32 = 60 \)

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of adding nail art to all 20 nails.**

- The cost of nail art per nail is $3.
- Karen has 20 nails (10 on each hand).

Total cost for nail art: \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \)

**Step 3: Add the discounted price of the services to the cost of the nail art.**

Total cost: \( 60 + 60 = 120 \)

Therefore, Karen would pay a total of $120."
"To find out how many magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the total number of issues from each magazine and then sum them up.

1. For the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year each:
   \[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ issues} \]

2. For the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
   \[ 6 \text{ issues} \]

3. For the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
   \[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ issues} \]

Now, we sum up all the issues:
\[ 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 \text{ issues} \]

So, Susan gets a total of 66 issues every year. However, the question asks for the number of magazines, not the number of issues. We need to count the number of magazines:

- 3 magazines with 12 issues each
- 1 magazine with 6 issues
- 1 magazine with 24 issues

Therefore, the total number of magazines is:
\[ 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 5 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Samantha has 27 paintings.
2. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. So, if we add 12 to Samantha's paintings, we get the number of paintings Shelley has:
   \[
   \text{Shelley's paintings} = 27 + 12 = 39
   \]
3. Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. So, to find out how many paintings Kim has, we subtract 8 from the number of paintings Shelley has:
   \[
   \text{Kim's paintings} = 39 - 8 = 31
   \]

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings."
"To find the final price of the toy after the changes in November, December, and January, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the price in December after an 80% increase:**
   - The original price in November is $40.
   - An 80% increase means the price is increased by 80% of $40.
   - 80% of $40 is \( 0.80 \times 40 = 32 \).
   - Therefore, the new price in December is \( 40 + 32 = 72 \).

2. **Calculate the price in January after a 50% decrease:**
   - The price in December is $72.
   - A 50% decrease means the price is reduced by 50% of $72.
   - 50% of $72 is \( 0.50 \times 72 = 36 \).
   - Therefore, the new price in January is \( 72 - 36 = 36 \).

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"First, let's calculate the amount Charlie makes from the 4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour.

\[ 4 \text{ lessons} \times \$80 \text{ per lesson} = \$320 \]

Next, we need to determine the reduced rate for lessons with a veteran. Since the rate is reduced by 25%, we calculate 25% of $80 and subtract it from the standard rate.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$80 = 0.25 \times \$80 = \$20 \]

So, the reduced rate is:

\[ \$80 - \$20 = \$60 \]

Now, we calculate the amount Charlie makes from the 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran at the reduced rate of $60 per hour.

\[ 2 \text{ lessons} \times \$60 \text{ per lesson} = \$120 \]

Finally, we add the amounts from both types of lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make for the day.

\[ \$320 + \$120 = \$440 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is:

\[ \$440 \]"

"First, let's calculate how many apples Walter ate. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 apples:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, let's find out how many apples he had left after eating:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Next, Walter gave 25% of the remaining apples to his sister. To find out how many apples that is, we calculate 25% of 36:

\[ 0.25 \times 36 = 9 \]

So, Walter gave 9 apples to his sister. Now, let's find out how many apples he had left after giving some to his sister:

\[ 36 - 9 = 27 \]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple:

\[ 27 \times 3 = 81 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days. Since Michael travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we need to know how many hours he travels in 3 days. Assuming he travels 24 hours a day (excluding any stops), the total travel time in 3 days is:

\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the total distance Michael travels in 72 hours:

\[ 72 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ km/hr} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the 6000 km distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered. We do this by dividing the distance Michael has traveled by the total distance and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:

\[ \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered is:

"To determine the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.
2. Determine the total available time over the 5 days.
3. Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.
4. Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.**

Each classroom takes 15 minutes to clean. Therefore, for 80 classrooms:
\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total available time over the 5 days.**

The custodian works 8 hours a day. Converting 8 hours to minutes:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Over 5 days, the total available time is:
\[ 480 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 2400 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.**

"To determine how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to calculate the total capacity of one bookcase.

1. Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, we add up the capacity of all the shelves in one bookcase:
\[10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55\]

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs, and the cost per dozen is $2.40. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's determine how many eggs Rose has in total. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many sets of 3 eggs she can sell from 60 eggs:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since she sells each set of 3 eggs for $1, her total revenue from selling all the eggs is:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Rose's profit is:

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. So, we can write:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \( 96 \)."

"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using, let's break down the information given:

1. **Flashlights:**
   - There are 4 people in the family, so there are 4 flashlights for the people.
   - There are 8 rooms, and for each room, there are 2 flashlights. So, \(8 \times 2 = 16\) flashlights for the rooms.
   - Total flashlights = \(4 + 16 = 20\).

2. **Candles:**
   - Half of the 8 rooms have 4 small candles each. So, \(8 / 2 = 4\) rooms have 4 small candles each. Total small candles = \(4 \times 4 = 16\).
   - The other half of the 8 rooms have 5 medium candles each. So, \(4\) rooms have 5 medium candles each. Total medium candles = \(4 \times 5 = 20\).
   - Total candles = \(16 + 20 = 36\).

Adding the total number of flashlights and candles together:
- Total flashlights = 20
- Total candles = 36
- Total items = \(20 + 36 = 56\).

"To solve this problem, let's break down the time taken for each side of the Rubik's cube:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice the time of the first side, so each of these takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. The last two sides each take half the time of the first side, so each of these takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.
4. The sixth side (which is the fifth side mentioned in the problem) is not specified, but since the problem states ""once you get the 5th side you have all 6 sides,"" we can assume the sixth side takes the same time as the fifth side, which is 2.5 minutes.

Now, let's add up the times:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

Total time = \(5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30\) minutes.

The Rubik's cube takes 30 minutes to solve."

   - Plants needing half a cup and 1 cup of water = 4 + 8 = 12.
   - Therefore, the number of plants needing a quarter of a cup of water = 20 - 12 = 8.
   - Each of these 8 plants needs 0.25 cups of water.
   - Total water for these plants = 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Now, we add up the total water needed for all the plants:
- Total water = 2 cups (half a cup plants) + 8 cups (1 cup plants) + 2 cups (quarter a cup plants) = 12 cups.

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To return home, Phineas Frog needs to cover a total distance of 200 yards. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, he will cover 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop on land:
- Speed on land = 20 yards per minute
- Distance on land = 100 yards
- Time on land = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to swim in water:
- Speed in water = 10 yards per minute
- Distance in water = 100 yards
- Time in water = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Finally, we add the time spent on land and in water to find the total time:
- Total time = Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

Therefore, it will take Phineas Frog 15 minutes to return home."
"To determine the cost for Bob to build his project, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of boxes.

First, we know that Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks and each box contains 8 popsicle sticks. To find out how many boxes he needs, we divide the total number of popsicle sticks by the number of popsicle sticks per box:

\[ \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{56 \text{ popsicle sticks}}{8 \text{ popsicle sticks/box}} = 7 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we know that each box costs $2.00. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 7 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$14.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"The main phone plan costs $20, and it costs twice as much as each additional phone. Therefore, each additional phone costs $20 / 2 = $10.

Since there are five phones in total and one of them is the main phone, there are 4 additional phones. The cost for the additional phones is 4 * $10 = $40.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones, which is $20 + $40 = $60.

Therefore, the whole phone plan costs $60."
"To calculate how much money Derrick makes in June from selling all the doughnuts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of doughnuts made daily.
2. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts in June.

Step 1: Number of doughnuts made daily
Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since 1 dozen equals 12 doughnuts, he makes:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ doughnuts per day} \]

Step 2: Total number of doughnuts made in June
June typically has 30 days. Therefore, the total number of doughnuts made in June is:
\[ 120 \times 30 = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

Step 3: Total revenue from selling all the doughnuts in June
Derrick sells each doughnut for $2. Therefore, the total revenue is:
\[ 3600 \times 2 = 7200 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Derrick makes \(\boxed{7200}\) dollars in June if he sells all the doughnuts."
"Jade takes 7 photos in one batch and uploads 6 batches each day. So, the number of photos she uploads each day is:

\[ 7 \text{ photos/batch} \times 6 \text{ batches/day} = 42 \text{ photos/day} \]

She has a total of 210 photos to upload. To find out how many days she will need to upload all her photos, we divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads each day:

\[ \frac{210 \text{ photos}}{42 \text{ photos/day}} = 5 \text{ days} \]

So, Jade will need 5 days to upload all of her photos."
"To calculate the total amount Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks, we first need to determine the cost for one week and then multiply that by 5.

1. Cost for blouses in one week: \(5 \text{ blouses} \times \$5.00 = \$25.00\)
2. Cost for pants in one week: \(2 \text{ pants} \times \$8.00 = \$16.00\)
3. Cost for skirts in one week: \(1 \text{ skirt} \times \$6.00 = \$6.00\)

Now, we add these amounts to find the total cost for one week:
\[
\$25.00 + \$16.00 + \$6.00 = \$47.00
\]

Next, we multiply the weekly cost by 5 to find the total cost for 5 weeks:
\[
\$47.00 \times 5 = \$235.00
\]

Therefore, Alicia spends \(\$235.00\) on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed after training. His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster:

\[ 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of words John needs to speak. Each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages:

\[ 450 \, \text{words/page} \times 10 \, \text{pages} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we can calculate the time it would take for John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. The time is calculated by dividing the total number of words by his speaking speed:

\[ \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speed."
"On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day, so:
50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so:
2 * 70 = 140 people.

For the rest of the week (days 4, 5, 6, and 7), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Since there are 4 days, the total number of people he saw over these days is:
4 * 60 = 240 people.

Now, to find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we add the number of people from each day:
50 (first day) + 70 (second day) + 140 (third day) + 240 (remaining days) = 500 people.

Therefore, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:
500."
"Let's break down the popping process step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds:** 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds:** The popping rate triples, so \(20 \times 3 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Following 30 seconds:** The popping rate quadruples, so \(20 \times 4 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds:** The popping rate is halved from the previous 30 seconds, so \(80 \div 2 = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, we add up the number of kernels that popped in the first four 30-second intervals:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\]

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop. So, a quarter of 40 kernels pop:
\[40 \div 4 = 10\]

Adding these to the total number of popped kernels:
\[200 + 10 = 210\]

Therefore, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:
\[210\]"
"To determine how many lemons Tim will need, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount of lemonade needed:**
   - Tim needs 4 gallons for the party.
   - Allen asked for an extra gallon that is twice as tart, which means it will have the same amount of lemon juice as a regular gallon but will be more concentrated.
   - Therefore, Tim needs 4 gallons + 1 gallon = 5 gallons of lemonade in total.

2. **Determine the amount of lemon juice needed:**
   - For 1 gallon of lemonade, Tim needs 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.
   - For 5 gallons, he will need 5 cups of lemon juice.

3. **Calculate the number of lemons needed:**
   - 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
   - To get 5 cups of juice, Tim will need 5 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 30 lemons.

Therefore, Tim will need 30 lemons."
"To calculate the total amount of dog food needed for a week, we first need to determine the daily consumption for each breed and then multiply by 7 days.

For the German Shepherds:
- 3 German Shepherds consume 5 kilograms each per day.
- Daily consumption for German Shepherds = 3 * 5 = 15 kilograms.

For the Bulldogs:
- 2 Bulldogs consume 3 kilograms each per day.
- Daily consumption for Bulldogs = 2 * 3 = 6 kilograms.

Total daily consumption for all dogs:
- Total daily consumption = 15 (German Shepherds) + 6 (Bulldogs) = 21 kilograms.

Now, to find the weekly consumption:
- Weekly consumption = 21 kilograms/day * 7 days/week = 147 kilograms.

Therefore, the total amount of dog food needed in a week is 147 kilograms."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we first calculate the total number of legs from both the 2-legged and 4-legged animals.

For the 2-legged animals:
10 animals * 2 legs/animal = 20 legs

For the 4-legged animals:
15 animals * 4 legs/animal = 60 legs

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:
20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

Since we need to find the number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:
80 legs / 2 = 40 pairs of legs

Therefore, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 40."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know there are 4 blue blocks.
2. There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, so there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) yellow blocks.
3. Let the number of red blocks be \(R\).

The total number of blocks in the tower is the sum of the blue, yellow, and red blocks, which is given as 32. So, we can write the equation:

\[4 \text{ (blue)} + 8 \text{ (yellow)} + R \text{ (red)} = 32\]

Now, we can solve for \(R\):

\[4 + 8 + R = 32\]
\[12 + R = 32\]
\[R = 32 - 12\]
\[R = 20\]

So, there are 20 red blocks in the tower.

   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

2. **Distance traveled east:**
   - Time: 8 hours
   - Speed: 18 mph
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

3. **Net distance from the house:**
   - Distance traveled west: 90 miles
   - Distance traveled east: 144 miles
   - Net distance = Distance east - Distance west = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Elvis is now 54 miles from his house."
"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and apply it to the boat's value step by step.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - Initial value: $9000
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700 \)
   - Value after first year: \( 9000 - 2700 = 6300 \)

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the second year: $6300
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890 \)
   - Value after second year: \( 6300 - 1890 = 4410 \)

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the third year: $4410
   - Depreciation rate: 20%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 4410 \times 0.20 = 882 \)
   - Value after third year: \( 4410 - 882 = 3528 \)

The boat is worth $3528 after the three years."
"To find out how many pink candies there are, we first need to determine the quantities of the other colored candies.

1. **Red Candies**: There are 54 red candies.
2. **Orange Candies**: There are twice as many orange candies as red candies, so:
   \[
   2 \times 54 = 108 \text{ orange candies}
   \]
3. **Yellow Candies**: There are half as many yellow candies as red candies, so:
   \[
   \frac{54}{2} = 27 \text{ yellow candies}
   \]

Now, we add up the red, orange, and yellow candies to find out how many candies are not pink:
\[
54 + 108 + 27 = 189 \text{ candies}
\]

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the number of non-pink candies from the total:
\[
232 - 189 = 43
\]

Therefore, the number of pink candies is:
\[
\boxed{43}

"To find out how much Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus trips separately, and then add them together.

1. **Hotel Cost:**
   - Helen booked a hotel for 3 nights.
   - The cost for one night is $80.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the hotel is \(3 \times 80 = 240\) dollars.

2. **Bus Travel Cost:**
   - Helen rode the bus 7 times.
   - Each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel.
   - The cost of one bus trip is \(80 \times 0.10 = 8\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the bus trips is \(7 \times 8 = 56\) dollars.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - The total cost for the hotel and bus travels is the sum of the hotel cost and the bus travel cost.

Next, we find out how many pens Sarah has. Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of pens Sarah has} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Therefore, Sarah has 27 pens."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Albert's height**: Albert is 36 inches tall.
2. **Anne's height**: Anne is twice the size of Albert, so Anne is \(2 \times 36 = 72\) inches tall.
3. **Jackie's current height**: Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne, so Jackie is \(72 - 2 = 70\) inches tall.
4. **Jackie's height before the summer**: Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer, so before the summer, she was \(70 - 3 = 67\) inches tall.

Therefore, Jackie was 67 inches tall before the summer."
"To find out how much money the company will receive for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bars produced in one day.
2. Calculate the number of bars produced in two weeks.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the produced bars.

Step 1: The company produces 5000 bars per day.

Step 2: There are 14 days in two weeks, so the total number of bars produced in two weeks is:
\[ 5000 \text{ bars/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 70000 \text{ bars} \]

Step 3: The company sells each bar for $2, so the total revenue is:
\[ 70000 \text{ bars} \times \$2/\text{bar} = \$140000 \]

Therefore, the company will receive \(\$140000\) for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks."
"To find the total amount Jake spends, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

1. **T-shirts:**
   - Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a ""buy one get one 50% off"" deal.
   - The original price of each T-shirt is $8.
   - For the first T-shirt, the cost is $8.
   - For the second T-shirt, the cost is 50% of $8, which is $4.
   - Total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

2. **Shoes:**
   - The shoes are 40% off the original price.
   - The original price of the shoes is $40.
   - The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is $16.
   - The sale price of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

3. **Total amount spent:**
   - Total cost for T-shirts is $12.
   - Total cost for shoes is $24.
   - Total amount spent is $12 + $24 = $36.

The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36."
"First, let's calculate how much money Ryan has earned from his allowance over 3 weeks. Since he earns $6 each week, over 3 weeks he earns:

\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Ryan and his friends spent on ice cream. Since he bought ice cream for himself and 3 friends, that's a total of 4 people. Each ice cream cone costs $1.25, so the total cost for the ice cream is:

\[ 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the ice cream from his total allowance, we find out how much money Ryan has left:

\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining $13. Each movie ticket costs $6.50. To find out how many tickets he can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one ticket:

\[ \left\lfloor \frac{13}{6.50} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 2 \right\rfloor = 2 \]

So, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.

**Final numerical answer:**

"To find out how much Ellen and Lani spent in all, we need to add up the costs of all the items they bought.

First, let's calculate the total amount Ellen spent:
- Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100.
- Ellen also bought a photo frame for $5.
So, Ellen's total is $100 + $5 = $105.

Next, let's calculate the total amount Lani spent:
- Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30.
- Lani also bought two bathrobes, each costing $100, so the total for the bathrobes is $100 + $100 = $200.
So, Lani's total is $30 + $200 = $230.

Now, we add Ellen's total and Lani's total to find the overall amount spent:
- Ellen's total: $105
- Lani's total: $230
So, the total amount spent by both is $105 + $230 = $335.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
$335"
"To calculate the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of the honey and jam mix, we need to first determine the cost of ingredients for one jar and then calculate the total cost and revenue for 10 jars.

**Cost of ingredients for one jar:**

- Passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20

Total cost for one jar = $12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44

**Revenue from selling one jar:**

- Selling price of one jar = $50

**Profit from one jar:**

- Profit = Revenue - Cost = $50 - $44 = $6

**Profit from 10 jars:**

- Total profit = Profit per jar * Number of jars = $6 * 10 = $60

**Final numerical answer:**

$60"
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to convert each type of coin into its dollar value and then sum these values.

1. **Quarters**: Each quarter is worth $0.25. Justin has 32 quarters.
   \[
   32 \times 0.25 = 8 \text{ dollars}

"Josh is open 5 days a week (Monday through Saturday). In 2 weeks, he would be open for \(5 \times 2 = 10\) days. He services 3 cars a day, so in 2 weeks, he services \(3 \times 10 = 30\) cars. Since he gets paid $4 per car, his total earnings in 2 weeks would be \(30 \times 4 = 120\).

Therefore, Josh makes $120 in 2 weeks."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, Randy has:
   - 9 oatmeal cookies
   - 4 chocolate chip cookies
   - 5 sugar cookies

2. Randy ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor:
   - Oatmeal: 9 - 1 = 8
   - Chocolate chip: 4 - 1 = 3
   - Sugar: 5 - 1 = 4

3. He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
   - Oatmeal: 8 - 2 = 6

4. He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends:

"First, let's calculate the total number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate gets home, he starts filling holes at a rate of 9 holes a day, but the dog continues to dig 6 new holes each night. This means that each day, the net change in the number of holes is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes filled} - 6 \text{ holes dug} = 3 \text{ holes filled per day} \]

Now, we need to determine how many days it takes to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes."
"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School, and Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 \]

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = 3000 \]

Now, to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract the average enrollment of Butler High School from that of Norman High School:

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 4000 - 3000 \]

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 1000 \]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, so Igor gathered \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.
2. Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, so Igor gathered \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.
3. Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, but let's denote the number of beakers Igor actually gathered as \( x \).

The total number of items on the lab bench is the sum of the test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes Igor gathered, which is given as 29. So we can write the equation:
\[ 8 + x + 16 = 29 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 24 + x = 29 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides:
\[ x = 29 - 24 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, Igor gathered 5 beakers. Since Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, the number of beakers Igor lost is:
\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

Therefore, Igor lost \(\boxed{2}\) beakers."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

- Alexandra raises $430.
- Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.
- Sarah raises $300.
- Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add up the amounts raised by all of them:

- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: $750
- Maryam: $700
- Sarah: $300

Total amount raised = $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the distance Aaron ran:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, so Aaron ran half the distance Vanessa ran.
   - Therefore, Aaron ran \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.

2. **Determine Aaron's running speed:**
   - Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.
   - So, Aaron's speed is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \).

3. **Determine Vanessa's running speed:**
   - Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
   - If Aaron's speed is \( \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \), then Vanessa's speed is \( 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}} \).

4. **Calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:**
   - Since Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}} \), to run 4 miles, she would take \( 4 \times 4 \text{ minutes} = 16 \text{ minutes} \).

Therefore, Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her part of the race."

1. Calculate the cost price per watermelon.
2. Determine the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost price per watermelon.**

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. So, the cost price per watermelon is:
\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \]

**Step 2: Determine the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit.**

A 25% profit means the selling price is 125% of the cost price. So, the selling price per watermelon is:
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 1.25 = 2.00 \]

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00."
"First, let's determine Dora's current age. If Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

James is twice as old as Dora, so James is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.

Now, we need to find out how old John was when James was born. Since John was 32 when his son James was born, and James is currently 18, John is currently 32 + 18 = 50 years old.

The question asks for the age of John's youngest son in 3 years. Since the youngest son was born when John was 32, and we are not given any information about the youngest son's current age, we can assume the question is referring to James, as he is the only son mentioned in the context of John's age at birth.

So, in 3 years, James will be 18 + 3 = 21 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in an hour and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate how many oranges Ana can peel in an hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

Next, let's calculate how many oranges Jane can peel in an hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- Ana peels 20 oranges.
- Jane peels 15 oranges.
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost is $400, and he gets it at 80% off.

The discount amount is:
\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

So, the cost of the radiator after the discount is:
\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the mechanic's work. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours, so the total cost for the mechanic is:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's work to find the total amount Mark paid:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is:

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of equations. Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( 2C + 4K = 70 \) (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

We can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( C \):
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).
