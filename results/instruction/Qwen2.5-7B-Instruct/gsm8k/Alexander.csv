"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and uses 4 for baking muffins for her friends. So, the total number of eggs used by Janet is:

3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for baking) = 7 eggs

The remainder of the eggs that she sells at the farmers' market is:

16 (total eggs) - 7 (used eggs) = 9 eggs

She sells each egg for $2. Therefore, the amount she makes from selling the eggs at the farmers' market every day is:

9 (eggs) * $2 (per egg) = $18

So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber, which means it takes 1 bolt of white fiber (since half of 2 is 1).

In total, it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts.

"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The value increased by 150%, so we need to find 150% of the original purchase price and add it to the original purchase price.

The original purchase price is $80,000. 150% of $80,000 is calculated as follows:
\[ 150\% \times 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

Adding this to the original purchase price gives us the new value of the house:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost, which includes the purchase price and the repair cost:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000."
"James runs 3 sprints, each 60 meters, three times a week. 

To calculate the total distance he runs in a week, we multiply the number of sprints per session by the distance of each sprint, and then by the number of sessions per week:

\[ 3 \text{ sprints/session} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

So, James runs a total of 540 meters a week."
"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken consumes in a day.
2. Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon.
3. Subtract the total morning and afternoon feed from the daily feed requirement to find the amount needed for the final meal.

First, we know that each chicken consumes 3 cups of feed per day. With 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we know that in the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed, and in the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed. So, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the morning and afternoon feed from the total daily feed requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens \(\boxed{20}\) cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of 16 glasses, where every second glass is 60% of the regular price.

1. The regular price of one glass is $5.
2. Every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = $3\).

Now, let's break down the 16 glasses into two categories: the first glass in each pair and the second glass in each pair.

- For the first glass in each pair, Kylar will pay $5 for each of the 8 pairs (since 16 glasses divided by 2 is 8).
- For the second glass in each pair, Kylar will pay $3 for each of the 8 pairs.

So, the total cost is:
\[ 8 \times 5 + 8 \times 3 = 40 + 24 = 64 \]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sheep each city has based on the given relationships and then sum them up.

1. Let's start with the number of sheep in Seattle, which is given as 20.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So, the number of sheep in Charleston is \(4 \times 20 = 80\).
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, the number of sheep in Toulouse is \(2 \times 80 = 160\).

Now, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together:

\[20 + 80 + 160 = 260\]

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 260."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. Calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the file.
2. Add the time taken for the Windows update restart.
3. Calculate the time to download the remaining 60% of the file.
4. Sum up all the times to get the total download time.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Time to download 40% of the file:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \(0.40 \times 200 = 80\) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \(80 \div 2 = 40\) minutes.

2. **Time for the Windows update restart:**
   - This is given as 20 minutes.

3. **Time to download the remaining 60% of the file:**
   - 60% of 200 GB is \(0.60 \times 200 = 120\) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \(120 \div 2 = 60\) minutes.

4. **Total time:**
   - Total time = Time to download 40% + Time for Windows update restart + Time to download 60%
   - Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is 120 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance John has traveled and then determine how far he is from home at the end of the 4 hours.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Journey:**
   - John drives for 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered during this time.
   - He then drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - He then drives for the remaining 1.5 hours (4 hours total - 2 hours in standstill - 0.5 hours at 30 mph) at 80 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Traveled:**
   - Total distance = Distance from the first leg + Distance from the return journey = 180 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - Since John is driving back home, the total distance he has traveled (315 miles) is the distance from his current position to home.

Therefore, at the end of those 4 hours, John is 315 miles from home."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her work hours into regular and overtime hours, then apply the appropriate rates.

1. Regular hours: 40 hours at $10 per hour.
2. Overtime hours: 45 total hours - 40 regular hours = 5 overtime hours at 1.2 times the regular rate.

First, calculate the earnings for the regular hours:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

Next, calculate the overtime rate:
\[ 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]

Then, calculate the earnings for the overtime hours:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Finally, add the regular earnings and the overtime earnings to get the total earnings for the week:
\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

Eliza's earnings for this week are $460."
"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, which is:
\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \]

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, so the program had 70% of the second month's downloads:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

The program had a total of 366 downloads over the three months."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330.

Now, we sum up the total costs:
- Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit becomes positive.

First, let's break down the costs and revenues:

1. **Initial Cost**: $90 (cost to plant the tree)
2. **Annual Costs**: $3 (water and feed the tree)
3. **Annual Revenue**: 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5

Now, let's calculate the net profit for each year after the initial year:

- **Net Profit per Year**: $10.5 (revenue) - $3 (cost) = $7.5

To find out how many years it will take to cover the initial cost, we divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:

- **Years to Cover Initial Cost**: $90 / $7.5 = 12 years

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

**Final Answer:**
12 years"
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there. This leaves her with \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners.

4. According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left after these sales. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step.

First, multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]

Next, add 2 to both sides:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]

Then, multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 2x = 36 \]

Finally, divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we have:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after the contemporary dance enrollment:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Now, 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

The rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance. So, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of hip-hop dance students by the total number of students and then multiply by 100:

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.60 \times 100 = 60\% \]

Therefore, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the expected value of the profit from each purchase after the speculated market increase.

1. **Jewelry Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value after increase: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125
   - Profit: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

2. **Electronic Gadgets Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value after increase: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096
   - Profit: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits:
- Jewelry: $125
- Electronic Gadgets: $96

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing the jewelry, which would yield a profit of $125.

**Final numerical answer:**
$125"
"Each train travels 80 miles westward and then 150 miles northward over the two days. 

To find the total distance covered by each train, we simply add the distances together:

80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles

Therefore, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her earnings from both her teaching and coaching jobs and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She earns $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
\[ 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} = 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- She earns $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
\[ 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours/week} = 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from coaching are:
\[ 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Finally, we add her annual earnings from both jobs to get her total annual salary:
\[ 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} + 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} = 57500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Her annual salary is:
\[ \boxed{57500} \]"
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one week.
3. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Claire eats 3 eggs every day.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she eats:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Step 3: In 4 weeks, she eats:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Step 4: Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert 84 eggs into dozens:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks."
"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time required to cover 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time already spent:**
   \[
   \text{Time spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Determine the remaining time to cover the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining time} = \text{Total time} - \text{Time spent} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - (4 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles}) = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}

"To find the original price of the book, we can use the relationship between the original price, the discount, and the final price. Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

Given that Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after a 25% discount, this means he paid 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

So, we can write the equation as:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's calculate the value:
\[ P = 26.00 \]

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.00."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we first need to calculate the total cost of the other items she bought.

1. The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
2. The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
3. The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total cost of the non-pizza items:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. So, the amount spent on pizza is:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is:
\[ \frac{17}{8.50} = 2 \]

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."

Therefore, Mishka spent a total of $243 on all the clothing items."
"Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, so in 60 days, she will consume 60 servings of ice cream.

Each carton contains 15 servings and costs $4.00. To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Since each carton costs $4.00, the total cost for 4 cartons is:

\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00/\text{carton} = \$16.00 \]

After 60 days, Cynthia will spend \(\boxed{16.00}\) on ice cream."
"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between these two points on his trip.

1. Henry's first stop was after 20 miles.
2. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip. This means he stopped at the 45th mile (60 - 15 = 45).

Now, to find the distance between his first and second stops, we subtract the mile marker of his first stop from the mile marker of his second stop:

45 miles (second stop) - 20 miles (first stop) = 25 miles

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

25 miles"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. So, we can write the equation for the total cost of the two pairs of high heels as:
\[ 33 + 2 \times 33 = B - 5 \]

First, calculate the cost of the two pairs of high heels:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Therefore, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up the relationship between Darrell's and Allen's ages using the given ratio and total age.

Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total age of Darrell and Allen is given as 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can find Allen's current age:

\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

Allen's age 10 years from now will be:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"To find the average guess, we first need to determine the guesses of each friend.

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we add these guesses together and divide by the number of guesses to find the average.

\[ \text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average guess} = \frac{240}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average guess} = 80 \]

The average guess is 80."

1. Calculate the daily hours spent on each dog.
2. Multiply the daily hours by the number of dogs.
3. Multiply the result by the number of days in a week.

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day, and John has 10 dogs. So, the daily hours spent are:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly hours spent are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

This gives us two equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now, we can find \( G \) using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

70"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps given in the question:

1. Determine how many jewels Aaron has.
2. Use the number of Aaron's jewels to find out how many jewels Siobhan has.

First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Then, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

So, Aaron has 25 jewels.

Next, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of Aaron's jewels to find out how many jewels Siobhan has:

\[ 25 - 2 = 23 \]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points.

25% of 4 points is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{25}{100} = 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \] points.

To find the total points scored, we add the points from both halves of the game:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Total points scored by Mike:

"Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Over 30 days, he will consume:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

The yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00. To find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"John sells 13 lego sets at $15 each, so the total amount of money he gets from selling the lego sets is:

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

He then buys 8 video games at $20 each, so the total cost for the video games is:

\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, he has $5 left. This means the money he spent on the video games plus the money he has left equals the money he got from selling the lego sets:

\[ 160 + 5 = 165 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he initially had $195 from selling the lego sets, and he spent $165 on video games and has $5 left, it means he has no lego sets left because he used all the money from selling the lego sets to buy the video games and still had some money left.

Therefore, the number of lego sets he still has is:

\[ 0 \]"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   - John runs 3 hours on the first day.
   - Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour.
   - Distance on the first day = \( 3v \) miles.

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   - He runs half as much as the first day on the other two days.
   - Distance on each of the other two days = \( \frac{3v}{2} \) miles.
   - Total distance on the other two days = \( 2 \times \frac{3v}{2} = 3v \) miles.

3. **Total weekly distance:**
   - Total distance in a week = Distance on the first day + Distance on the other two days.
   - Total distance = \( 3v + 3v = 6v \) miles.
   - We know the total weekly distance is 60 miles.
   - Therefore, \( 6v = 60 \).

4. **Solving for \( v \):**
   - \( v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \) miles per hour.

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

**Final numerical answer:**
10 miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's walking and running speeds, and then calculate the distances she covers while running and walking during the six-hour period.

1. **Determine the skipping speed and its relation to running speed:**
   - Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
   - Since skipping is half as fast as running, her running speed is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) miles per hour.

2. **Determine the walking speed:**
   - Running is four times faster than walking, so her walking speed is \(6 \div 4 = 1.5\) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking in a six-hour period.
   - Time spent running: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\) hours.
   - Time spent walking: \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4\) hours.

4. **Calculate the distances:**
   - Distance running: \(6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12\) miles.
   - Distance walking: \(1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6\) miles.

5. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance: \(12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18\) miles.

**Final numerical answer:**
18 miles"
"If Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, then Ben's iPhone is 2 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the calorie content of the entire bag of chips:**
   - A serving has 250 calories.
   - There are 5 servings in a 300g bag.
   - Therefore, the total calories in the bag are \( 250 \times 5 = 1250 \) calories.

2. **Calculate the remaining calories you can consume:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume are \( 2000 - 1800 = 200 \) calories.

3. **Determine how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining calories:**
   - A 300g bag contains 1250 calories.
   - To find out how many grams you can eat with 200 calories, we set up a proportion:
     \[
     \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{1250 \text{ calories}} = \frac{x \text{ grams}}{200 \text{ calories}}
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{300 \times 200}{1250} = \frac{60000}{1250} = 48 \text{ grams}
     \]

Therefore, you can eat 48 grams of chips."
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed to make 20 candles.
2. Determine the total cost of the supplies.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed.
Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax} \]

Step 2: Determine the total cost of the supplies.
The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00. Therefore, for 2 pounds, the cost is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
If each candle is sold for $2.00, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is:
\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00 \]

Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.
\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:
\[ \$20.00 \]"
"To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to first determine the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply by the average time it takes to write one article.

1. **Monday:**
   - Meredith wrote 5 articles.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday.
   - Number of articles on Tuesday = \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.
   - Number of articles on Wednesday = \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Now, we calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
- Total articles = 5 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 14 (Wednesday) = 26 articles.

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
- Total hours = 26 articles \(\times\) 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

**Final numerical answer:**

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of Post-it notes Candice had: 80.
2. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she used at work: 220.
3. Subtract the number of Post-it notes remaining: 23.

So, the calculation is:

80 (initial notes) - 220 (used at work) - 23 (remaining) = -163

This negative result indicates that Candice used more notes than she initially had, which means the package she purchased must have made up the difference. Therefore, we need to find out how many notes were in the package by adding the notes used and remaining to the initial amount:

80 (initial notes) + 220 (used at work) + 23 (remaining) = 323

So, the package Candice purchased contained 323 Post-it notes.

323"
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, we add the amount spent on blue ties and red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total spent on red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{800} \]"
"To determine how many 6-inch pieces Tracy can obtain from a 4-foot piece of wire, we first need to convert the length of the wire into inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, a 4-foot piece of wire is:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we divide the total length of the wire in inches by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces Tracy can obtain:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ inches}}{6 \text{ inches/piece}} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.
- The building has 15 floors.
- Each floor contains 8 units.
- Therefore, the total number of units is \(15 \times 8 = 120\).

Step 2: Determine the number of occupied units.
- 3/4 of the building is occupied.
- Therefore, the number of occupied units is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90\).

Step 3: Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.
- The number of unoccupied units is \(120 - 90 = 30\).

"To calculate how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many dozens of eggs are produced per day.
2. Calculate the daily earnings from selling the eggs.
3. Multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week to get the weekly earnings.

Step 1: Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.
Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Step 2: Calculate the daily earnings.
Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, so:
\[ 21 \text{ dozen} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$42 \text{ per day} \]

Step 3: Calculate the weekly earnings.
There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ \$42 \text{ per day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = \$294 \text{ per week} \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\$294\) on eggs per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to know the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. However, the distance is not provided in the question. Let's assume the distance from the starting point to the destination is \(D\) miles.

1. **Outbound Trip:**
   - Speed: 10 miles per hour
   - Time: 3 hours (from 1 PM to 4 PM)
   - Distance: \(D = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}\)

2. **Return Trip:**

"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, the remaining weight he needs to remove is:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the number of toys he needs to remove to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds is:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys."

"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after the truck and driver are on it.
2. Determine how many boxes can be added to the truck without exceeding this remaining weight capacity.

First, let's find the remaining weight capacity of the bridge. The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds, and the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Therefore, the remaining weight capacity is:

\[ 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many boxes can be added to the truck without exceeding this remaining weight capacity. Each box weighs 15 pounds. So, we divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box:

"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to work backwards from the final bill, accounting for the additional fees and tip.

1. The final bill is $40.00, which includes a 25% fee and $3.00 in delivery fees, as well as a $4.00 tip.

2. First, we need to find the cost before the 25% fee and the $3.00 delivery fee were added. Let's denote the cost before these fees as \( x \).

3. The 25% fee on \( x \) is \( 0.25x \), and the total before the tip is \( x + 0.25x + 3.00 \).

4. The final bill is the total before the tip plus the $4.00 tip, so we have:
   \[
   x + 0.25x + 3.00 + 4.00 = 40.00
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   1.25x + 7.00 = 40.00
   \]
   Subtract 7.00 from both sides:
   \[
   1.25x = 33.00
   \]
   Divide both sides by 1.25:
   \[
   x = \frac{33.00}{1.25} = 26.40
   \]

5. The cost of the groceries before any additional fees or tip was $26.40.

6. Now, we can calculate the final price by adding the 25% fee, the $3.00 delivery fee, and the $4.00 tip to the original cost:
   \[
   26.40 + 0.25 \times 26.40 + 3.00 + 4.00 = 26.40 + 6.60 + 3.00 + 4.00 = 40.00

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payments into two halves of the year and apply the given conditions.

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - The monthly charge is $140.
   - Total for the first half: \( 6 \times 140 = 840 \) dollars.

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - There are 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - The monthly charge is 10% less than the initial amount.
   - 10% of $140 is \( 0.10 \times 140 = 14 \) dollars.
   - The reduced monthly charge is \( 140 - 14 = 126 \) dollars.
   - Total for the second half: \( 6 \times 126 = 756 \) dollars.

3. **Total Amount Paid by the End of the Year:**

Therefore, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is **1596** dollars."
"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg). We know that Sophia has driven 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. Therefore, her car's fuel efficiency is:

\[ \text{Fuel Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Distance Driven}}{\text{Gallons of Gas Used}} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Now, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank of 12 gallons. Using the fuel efficiency we calculated:

\[ \text{Miles on a Full Tank} = \text{Fuel Efficiency} \times \text{Tank Capacity} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each time and reads for half as long, which is 1 hour. So, each session, he spends a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours on TV and reading.

He does this 3 times a week, so in one week, he spends 3 hours/session * 3 sessions/week = 9 hours.

Over 4 weeks, he would spend 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours.

Therefore, Jim spends 36 hours on TV and reading in 4 weeks."
"To find the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to consider the number of players and coaches for both the girls' and boys' teams from each school.

1. Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players.
2. Each school also has 2 coaches (one for each team).

So, for each school:
- Number of players = 2 teams * 5 players/team = 10 players
- Number of coaches = 2 coaches

Therefore, the total number of people per school = 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people sent by all the schools is:
- Total number of people = 4 schools * 12 people/school = 48 people

Final numerical answer:

"To find the total number of gems in the chest, we need to calculate the number of each type of gem and then sum them up.

1. **Diamonds**: There are 175 diamonds.
2. **Rubies**: There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So, the number of rubies is \(175 - 35 = 140\).
3. **Emeralds**: There are twice the number of emeralds than the rubies. So, the number of emeralds is \(2 \times 140 = 280\).

Now, we sum up the number of each type of gem to find the total number of gems in the chest:
\[175 \text{ (diamonds)} + 140 \text{ (rubies)} + 280 \text{ (emeralds)} = 595\]

Therefore, the total number of gems in the chest is 595."
"First, let's determine the number of boys at Dr. Wertz's school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

Number of boys = 2 * Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 * 60
Number of boys = 120

Next, we need to find the total number of students at the school. This is the sum of the number of boys and the number of girls:

Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of students = 120 + 60
Total number of students = 180

Now, we know that there are 5 students to every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher:

Number of teachers = Total number of students / Number of students per teacher
Number of teachers = 180 / 5
Number of teachers = 36

Therefore, there are 36 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school."
"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to subtract the total amount of her allowance from her final total.

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks. So, the total allowance she receives is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. To find out how much money she started with, we subtract the total allowance from her final total:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Therefore, Bailey started with $60."
"To calculate how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week.
2. Determine the total number of students she teaches in a week.
3. Calculate the total revenue based on the number of students and the charge per student.

First, let's calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week:

- She teaches 5 classes each weekday (Monday to Friday), so that's \(5 \times 5 = 25\) classes.
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.

So, the total number of classes in a week is \(25 + 8 = 33\).

Next, we calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week:

- Each class has 15 students, so for 33 classes, the total number of students is \(33 \times 15 = 495\).

Finally, we calculate the total revenue:

- She charges $15.00 per student, so for 495 students, the total revenue is \(495 \times 15 = 7425\).

Therefore, Judy makes \(\boxed{7425}\) dollars in one week."
"The first recipe has 20 instructions.

The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, which means it has \(20 \times 2 = 40\) instructions.

"To calculate the total amount of money Tommy raises, we need to multiply the number of each item sold by its price and then add the totals together.

For brownies:
- Tommy sells 43 brownies at $3 per slice.
- Total from brownies = 43 slices * $3/slice = $129

For cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake at $4 per slice.
- Total from cheesecakes = 23 slices * $4/slice = $92

Now, we add the totals from both items:
- Total money raised = $129 (from brownies) + $92 (from cheesecakes) = $221

Therefore, Tommy raises a total of $221."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones without interest:

\[ \text{Total cost without interest} = 5 \times \$150 = \$750 \]

Next, we calculate the interest for each unit. Since a 2% interest is charged for each unit, the total interest for all five units is:

\[ \text{Total interest} = 5 \times (2\% \times \$150) = 5 \times (0.02 \times \$150) = 5 \times \$3 = \$15 \]

So, the total cost including interest is:

\[ \text{Total cost with interest} = \$750 + \$15 = \$765 \]

Shiela will pay this amount in 3 monthly installments. Therefore, the monthly payment is:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{\$765}{3} = \$255 \]

Shiela will pay each month for 3 months:

\[ \$255 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$255 \]"

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given that the top level has a square footage of 16, and each subsequent level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of each level as follows:

1. Top level (Level 1): 16 square feet
2. Level 2: \(16 \div 2 = 8\) square feet
3. Level 3: \(8 \div 2 = 4\) square feet
4. Level 4: \(4 \div 2 = 2\) square feet

Now, we sum the square footage of all levels:

\[16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30\]

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:

\[\text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5\]

Therefore, the average square footage of a level is 7.5 square feet."
"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then consider that the question asks specifically about the first year. Since a year is typically considered to be 365 days, we can calculate the amount of food needed for the remaining days after the first 180 days.

1. For the first 180 days, the puppy needs 1 cup of dog food per day. Therefore, the total amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days is:
   \[
   180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. For the remaining days of the year, which is \(365 - 180 = 185\) days, the puppy needs 2 cups of dog food per day. Therefore, the total amount of dog food needed for the remaining 185 days is:
   \[
   185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. Adding the amounts from the first 180 days and the remaining 185 days gives the total amount of dog food needed for the first year:
   \[
   180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups}
   \]

4. Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags needed is:
   \[
   \frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags}
   \]

Therefore, the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year is:
\[
\boxed{5}

   - Therefore, David does \( \frac{400}{4} = 100 \) pounds of laundry.

2. **Determine the amount of laundry Raymond does:**
   - Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.
   - Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
   - Therefore, Raymond does \( \frac{400}{2} = 200 \) pounds of laundry.

3. **Calculate the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David:**
   - Raymond does 200 pounds of laundry.
   - David does 100 pounds of laundry.
   - The difference is \( 200 - 100 = 100 \) pounds.

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds."
"To determine how much money Vincent saves, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in the most economical way versus the less economical way.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:
- Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
- Total cost: \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15.00 \)

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1.00 each:
- Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
- Total cost: \( 9 \times 1.00 = 9.00 \)

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two options:
- Cost difference: \( 15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00 \)

Therefore, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

   - Final cost = $100 - $30 = $70

The final cost of the grooming after the discount is $70."
"Each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water. So, the amount of water each girl got is:

\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they got together is:

\[ 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

The boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water distributed is:

\[ 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

The initial amount of water was 24 liters. Therefore, the amount of water left is:

\[ 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

10 liters of water were left."
"To find out how many stickers Charlie has left, we need to follow the sequence of events and perform the necessary calculations.

1. Charlie starts with 10 stickers.
2. He then buys 21 more stickers, so we add 21 to his initial amount:
   \[
   10 + 21 = 31
   \]
3. For his birthday, he receives 23 more stickers, so we add 23 to his current total:
   \[
   31 + 23 = 54
   \]
4. Charlie gives 9 stickers to his sister, so we subtract 9 from his current total:
   \[
   54 - 9 = 45
   \]
5. He uses 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so we subtract 28 from his current total:
   \[
   45 - 28 = 17

"First, let's calculate Alex's weight. Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. So, we calculate 4 times Grace's weight and then subtract 2 pounds.

\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \]
\[ 500 - 2 = 498 \]

So, Alex weighs 498 pounds.

Now, to find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight to Alex's weight.

\[ 125 + 498 = 623 \]

Their combined weights are 623 pounds."

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( W + L = 22 \)
2. \( W = L + 8 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find the number of games they won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

The alarm rang a total of 22 times."
"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the salary increase after 5 years.
2. Calculate the salary increase for the next three years.

**Step 1: Calculate the salary after 5 years.**

Sylvie's initial salary is $600 per month. After 5 years, her salary is increased by 10% of the initial salary.

\[ \text{Salary after 5 years} = 600 + (0.10 \times 600) = 600 + 60 = 660 \text{ per month} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the salary after an additional 3 years.**

The salary increases by 10% each year for those who have stayed for 5 years. So, we need to calculate the salary for each of the next three years.

\[ \text{Salary after 6 years} = 660 + (0.10 \times 660) = 660 + 66 = 726 \text{ per month} \]

\[ \text{Salary after 7 years} = 726 + (0.10 \times 726) = 726 + 72.6 = 798.6 \text{ per month} \]

\[ \text{Salary after 8 years} = 798.6 + (0.10 \times 798.6) = 798.6 + 79.86 = 878.46 \text{ per month} \]

**Final Answer:**

Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is $10,541.48."
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies."
"Christina invited 16 friends, but since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we need to calculate the number of guests who are expected to attend.

1/4 of 16 friends don't show up, so:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \]

This means 4 friends won't attend. Therefore, the number of friends who will attend is:
\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \]

Christina needs .75 gift bags per invited guest. So, for 12 guests, the number of gift bags needed is:
\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost for 9 gift bags is:

"First, we need to determine Gerald's original time for the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, and Lee's current time is 38 seconds, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's current time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to calculate Gerald's new time after his speed improved by 10%. An improvement in speed by 10% means that Gerald can now run 110% of the distance in the same time. Therefore, his new time is:

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = \text{Gerald's original time} \times \frac{100\%}{110\%} = 40 \text{ seconds} \times \frac{100}{110} = 40 \text{ seconds} \times \frac{10}{11} = \frac{400}{11} \text{ seconds} \approx 36.36 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in:

"Given that the number of dogs is 60, and there are two cats for every dog, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we first find the combined number of dogs and cats:

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120
Combined number of dogs and cats = 180

The number of rabbits is twelve less than this combined number:

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the Grade 5 class.

Given that 2/5 of the students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the total number of students is 200, the number of girls can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. We are told that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, so:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scout is 40."

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the volume of tomatoes before they are cooked into sauce.
2. Calculate the number of cans of tomatoes used.
3. Calculate the number of tomatoes used based on the number of cans.

First, we know that the sauce made is 32 ounces, and the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked. This means that the volume of the tomatoes before cooking was twice the volume of the sauce. Therefore, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking was:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes were used to get 64 ounces of tomatoes. The number of cans used is:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Each can contains three tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is:
\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We start with 30 cars on the motorway.
2. After 15 minutes, some cars drive through the traffic jam.
3. In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through the traffic jam.
4. Additionally, 5 cars take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in both 15-minute intervals is \( x + 20 \).

Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that actually drove through the traffic jam is the total number of cars minus the 5 that took an exit. This can be expressed as:
\[ 30 - 5 = 25 \]

Therefore, we have the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

"Mary initially has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, the total number of potted plants she has before receiving the new ones is:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Yesterday, she received 18 new potted plants. Adding these to her existing plants gives:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Tomorrow, she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family. Since there are 40 window ledges, she will give away:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Subtracting the plants she will give away from her total gives:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

Mary will remain with 58 potted plants."

The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. We need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles.

First, we calculate the time it takes to cover 1 mile:
\[ \text{Time per mile} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes to cover 42 miles:
\[ \text{Time for 42 miles} = 42 \text{ miles} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

140 minutes"
"First, let's calculate how many pieces Poppy places on the board. She places a quarter of the 1000 pieces:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \]

So, 250 pieces are placed on the board by Poppy. This leaves:

\[ 1000 - 250 = 750 \]

Next, her mom places a third of the remaining 750 pieces:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \]

So, her mom places 250 more pieces on the board. This leaves:

\[ 750 - 250 = 500 \]

Therefore, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is:

\[ 500 \]"

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box, then find its inner volume, and finally multiply by 3 for the total volume of all 3 boxes.

Given that the walls are 1 inch thick, the inner dimensions of each box will be reduced by 2 inches in each dimension (1 inch from each side).

So, the inner dimensions of each box are:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

The inner volume of one box is calculated as:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 3 \, \text{inches} \times 4 \, \text{inches} \times 2 \, \text{inches} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 24 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
\[ \text{Total Volume} = 24 \, \text{cubic inches/box} \times 3 \, \text{boxes} \]
\[ \text{Total Volume} = 72 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches."
"To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the total hours of TV he watched throughout the week and then isolate the Wednesday viewing.

1. **Monday and Tuesday**: Frankie watched 1-hour episodes each night.
   - Total for Monday and Tuesday: \(1 \, \text{hour} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 2 \, \text{hours}\)

2. **Thursday**: Frankie watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show.
   - Total for Thursday: \(1 \, \text{hour} + 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 1.5 \, \text{hours}\)

3. **Friday**: Frankie watched two 1-hour episodes.
   - Total for Friday: \(2 \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 2 \, \text{hours}\)

4. **Total hours for Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday**: 
   - \(2 \, \text{hours} + 1.5 \, \text{hours} + 2 \, \text{hours} = 5.5 \, \text{hours}\)

5. **Total hours of TV watched in the week**: 7 hours.

6. **Hours watched on Wednesday**:
   - \(7 \, \text{hours} - 5.5 \, \text{hours} = 1.5 \, \text{hours}\)

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, we can determine the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday by dividing the total hours watched on Wednesday by the length of each episode:
- Number of 30-minute episodes on Wednesday: \(1.5 \, \text{hours} \div 0.5 \, \text{hours/episode} = 3 \, \text{episodes}\)

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday."
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies.

However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he had left is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \).

We know that after dropping 5 cookies, he had 110 cookies left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

Final numerical answer:

"To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate in total, we need to calculate the area of each roll-up sheet they had.

For Beatrice:
- The roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- The total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice had is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

For Marcell:
- The roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- The total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell had is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Now, we add the number of fruit roll-ups each of them ate to find the total:
- Total number of fruit roll-ups = \(48 + 42 = 90\).

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate, we divide the total by 2 (since there are two people):
- Average = \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\).

Therefore, on average, they ate 45 fruit roll-ups."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much water Julia's boat took on during her journey to the shore.

First, we need to find out how many feet Julia rows in 64 seconds. We know that it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, the rate at which she rows is:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} \]

Now, we can calculate the total distance she rows in 64 seconds:

\[ \text{Distance} = \left(\frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}}\right) \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how much water the boat took on during this 80 feet journey. We know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, the amount of water taken on per foot is:

\[ \text{Water per foot} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{5 \text{ feet}} \]

Now, we can calculate the total amount of water taken on during the 80 feet journey:

\[ \text{Total water} = 80 \text{ feet} \times \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{5 \text{ feet}} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
2. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Therefore, Brittany's phone can hold \( \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \) photographs.
3. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as \( D \). According to the problem, \( 300 = 50 \times D \).

Now, we solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

So, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is 6."
"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue from selling it, then find the difference between the two.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:

- Sasha bought ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each.
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
  \]

- She also bought five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each.
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
  \]

- The total cost of the lumber is:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:

- She sells the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards. Since the price has increased by 50%, the new price per board is:
  \[
  \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15
  \]
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150
  \]

- She sells the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at the new price, which is also 50% higher than the original price of $16:
  \[
  \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24
  \]
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120
  \]

- The total revenue from selling the lumber is:
  \[
  \$150 + \$120 = \$270
  \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[
\$270 - \$180 = \$90
\]

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of \(\boxed{90}\)."
"Given the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, we can represent the amount of sugar and water used as 7x and 13x, respectively, where x is a common multiplier.

The total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 13x = 120\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[20x = 120\]

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now, to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used, we multiply the value of x by 7 (since the ratio of sugar is 7 parts):

\[7x = 7 \times 6 = 42\]

Therefore, Katy used 42 teaspoonfuls of sugar."
"John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children. Since each pair of shoes costs $60, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

1. First, find the total number of pairs of shoes: \(2 \text{ pairs/child} \times 3 \text{ children} = 6 \text{ pairs}\).
2. Then, calculate the total cost: \(6 \text{ pairs} \times \$60/\text{pair} = \$360\).

Therefore, John paid $360."
"On the first day, the customs officer counted 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles on the first day was:

2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

On the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day:

30 vehicles (total on the second day) - 10 vehicles (from the first day) = 20 vehicles

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:

20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
2. Adrien's salary increased by 40% four years later. So, his new salary is:
   \[ 40,000 \times (1 + 0.40) = 40,000 \times 1.40 = 56,000 \]

3. Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. So, if Lylah's salary was \( L \), then Adrien's salary four years ago was:
   \[ L \times (1 + 0.30) = 1.30L \]
   Since Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, we can set up the equation:
   \[ 1.30L = 40,000 \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[ L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = 30,769.23 \]

4. Four years later, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. So, her new salary is:
   \[ 30,769.23 \times (1 + 0.40) = 30,769.23 \times 1.40 = 43,076.94 \]

5. Now, we add Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries to find the total salary the two were receiving four years later:
   \[ 56,000 + 43,076.94 = 99,076.94 \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is $99,076.94."

For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so:
- Thursday: 6 + 1 = 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 7 hours

Now, let's add up all the hours she slept throughout the week:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.
4. After using the spoons, she had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as \( x \).

So, the total number of spoons Julia had before using any was \( x + 5 \) (since her husband gave her 5 spoons).

After using 3 spoons, she had 12 spoons left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ x = 10 \]

So, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

"Given that each pepper costs $15, we can calculate the cost of the other items based on this information.

1. **Cost of a watermelon:**
   - A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.
   - Therefore, the cost of a watermelon = 3 * $15 = $45.

2. **Cost of an orange:**
   - An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs.
   - Therefore, the cost of an orange = $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the items Dillon is buying:

- **Cost of 4 watermelons:**
  - 4 * $45 = $180.

- **Cost of 20 peppers:**
  - 20 * $15 = $300.

- **Cost of 10 oranges:**
  - 10 * $40 = $400.

Finally, we add up the costs to find the total amount Dillon will spend:

- Total cost = $180 (watermelons) + $300 (peppers) + $400 (oranges) = $880.

**The total amount of money he will spend is $880.**"
"To calculate the hospital's profit from these visits, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time spent by doctors with patients in a day.
2. Calculate the total revenue from patients.
3. Calculate the total cost to the hospital for the doctors' time.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Total time spent by doctors with patients in a day:**
   - The hospital sees 500 people a day.
   - Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.
   - Total time in minutes = 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes.
   - Convert minutes to hours: 12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours.

2. **Total revenue from patients:**
   - The hospital charges $200 an hour to patients.
   - Total revenue = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

3. **Total cost to the hospital for the doctors' time:**
   - The doctors charge $150 an hour to the hospital.
   - Total cost = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

4. **Profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

The hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps:

1. Start with the initial number of elves, which is 60.
2. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. So, we calculate a third of 60:

\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

We are given that there are 12 blue gumballs, so \( B = 12 \).

Substituting \( B = 12 \) into the equation:
\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

Therefore, there are 70 pink gumballs.

Final numerical answer:
70"
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many cars are semi-automatic. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. 

So, the number of semi-automatic cars is:
20 (total cars) - 12 (automatic cars) - 4 (manual cars) = 4 semi-automatic cars.

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

Therefore, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic."
"Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. B = 2Q (twice as many babies as queens)
2. W = 2B (twice as many worker bees as baby bees)
3. The total number of bees is 700, so W + B + Q = 700

Substituting the first two equations into the third equation, we get:
2B + B + (B/2) = 700

Combining like terms, we get:
3.5B = 700

Solving for B:
B = 700 / 3.5
B = 200

Now, we can find the number of worker bees (W) using the relationship W = 2B:
W = 2 * 200
W = 400

Therefore, there are 400 worker bees in the hive."
"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total hours Jordan spends playing video games in one week.
2. Determine how much he would earn if he worked those hours at his part-time job.

Step 1: Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{hours/week} \]

Step 2: Jordan earns $10 per hour at his part-time job. Therefore, if he worked 14 hours in a week, his earnings would be:
\[ 14 \, \text{hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$140/\text{week} \]

So, Jordan would earn \(\$140\) in one week if he spent his video game time working instead."
"First, let's identify the food and non-food items from the list:

- Milk: Food item (2 dollars)
- Eggs: Food item (3 dollars)
- Light bulbs: Non-food item (3 dollars)
- Cups: Non-food item (3 dollars)
- Roach traps: Non-food item (4 dollars)

Next, we calculate the total cost of the non-food items:

- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars

Total cost of non-food items = 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Now, we apply the 10% tax to the non-food items:

Tax on non-food items = 10% of 10 dollars = 0.10 * 10 = 1 dollar

So, the total cost of the non-food items including tax is:

10 dollars (original cost) + 1 dollar (tax) = 11 dollars

Now, we add the cost of the food items:

- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars

Total cost of food items = 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Finally, we add the total cost of the food items to the total cost of the non-food items including tax:

Total cost = 5 dollars (food) + 11 dollars (non-food with tax) = 16 dollars

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

16 dollars"
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have:

- Kim already has 3 clients.
- He is talking to 5 potential clients.
- Therefore, the total number of clients will be \(3 + 5 = 8\).

Next, we calculate the total expenses for the supplies:

- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
- The cost of 1 bottle of bleach is $2.
- The cost of 1 pack of cloths is $5.
- Therefore, the cost for supplies per client is \(2 \times 2 + 1 \times 5 = 4 + 5 = 9\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total expenses for all clients:

- The total number of clients is 8.
- The cost per client is $9.
- Therefore, the total expenses are \(8 \times 9 = 72\) dollars.

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:

- Total income = $92
- Total expenses = $72
- Profit = $92 - $72 = $20

Therefore, the profit Kim will make each week is $20."
"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare that John can harvest in one harvest.
2. Determine how many times John can harvest within a year.
3. Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the number of harvests in a year to get the total number of pineapples harvested in a year.

Step 1: Pineapples per hectare per harvest
- There are 100 pineapples per hectare.

Step 2: Number of harvests in a year
- John can harvest every 3 months.
- There are 12 months in a year.
- Therefore, the number of harvests in a year is \( \frac{12}{3} = 4 \) harvests.

Step 3: Total number of pineapples harvested in a year
- Total pineapples = Pineapples per hectare per harvest × Number of hectares × Number of harvests in a year
- Total pineapples = 100 × 10 × 4
- Total pineapples = 4000

Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year."
"Johnny has three Lego sets to pick up. 

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, which is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, which is \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

To find the total number of pieces Johnny picks up, we add the pieces from all three sets:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

Johnny picks up 2125 blocks."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return, which is 15 bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the first 6 hours leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
4. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first 6 hours and did not return in the second 6 hours return to the hive. Since 15 bees returned in the second 6 hours, 30 - 15 = 15 bees did not return in the second 6 hours. These 15 bees return in the last 6 hours.

So, in the last 6 hours, 15 bees return to the hive.

Final numerical answer:
15"
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we first need to calculate the total cost of the tickets.

The cost for 1 child ticket is $10, and the cost for 1 adult ticket is $12. Therefore, the total cost for both tickets is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$10 + \$12 = \$22 \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means the amount she gave the cashier minus the total cost of the tickets equals $8. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ \text{Amount given} - \text{Total cost} = \text{Change} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Amount given} - \$22 = \$8 \]

To find the amount given, we add $22 to $8:

\[ \text{Amount given} = \$22 + \$8 = \$30 \]

Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up some equations based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, so Charlie has \( 3D \) friends.
- James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, so James has \( 4D \) friends.
- Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook, so we can write the equation \( 3D = 12 \).

Now, we can solve for \( D \):
\[ 3D = 12 \]
\[ D = \frac{12}{3} \]
\[ D = 4 \]

So, Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends. Now, we can find out how many friends James has:
\[ 4D = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Therefore, James has 16 Facebook friends.

"To determine how long the winner will wait for the loser, we need to calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: 3 miles = 3 * 5280 feet = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles = 2 * 5280 feet = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Steve's time: \( \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet per minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \)
- Tim's time: \( \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet per minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \)

Since Steve is the winner, we need to find out how long he will wait for Tim:
- Difference in time: \( 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \)

Therefore, the winner (Steve) will be waiting for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

"To calculate how much Shawnda made that day, we need to consider the number of tires inflated and the cost per tire.

- Each bicycle has 2 tires, so 5 bicycles mean \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- Each tricycle has 3 tires, so 3 tricycles mean \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- A unicycle has 1 tire, so 1 unicycle means \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Adding these up, the total number of tires inflated is \(10 + 9 + 1 = 20\).

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost is \(20 \times 0.25 = 5\) dollars.

Therefore, Shawnda made \(\boxed{5}\) dollars that day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys:

"Let's work through the problem step by step, starting from the end and moving backwards.

1. **Final state**: 5 fries are left.
2. **Before the ants carried off the last fry**: There were 6 fries (since the ants carried off 1 fry).
3. **Before the raccoon stole two-thirds of the fries**: Let's denote the number of fries before the raccoon stole as \( x \). The raccoon stole two-thirds, so one-third remained. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{3}x = 6 \). Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 6 \times 3 = 18 \).
4. **Before the three pigeons ate their share**: Each pigeon ate 3 fries, so the pigeons ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries. Therefore, before the pigeons ate, there were \( 18 + 9 = 27 \) fries.
5. **Before the seagull ate half of what Dave ate**: Let's denote the number of fries the seagull ate as \( y \). The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, so \( y = \frac{1}{2} \times 14 = 7 \). Therefore, before the seagull ate, there were \( 27 + 7 = 34 \) fries.
6. **Before Dave ate 14 fries**: There were \( 34 + 14 = 48 \) fries in the pack when Dave bought it.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the hours for the days he has three 1-hour classes:
- He has three 1-hour classes each on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.
- So, for these three days, he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours per day.
- Over three days, that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the hours for the days he has two 2-hour classes:
- He has two 2-hour classes each on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
- So, for these two days, he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours per day.
- Over two days, that's \(2 \times 4 = 8\) hours.

Now, let's add the hours from both types of days to get the total weekly hours:
- Total weekly hours = \(9 + 8 = 17\) hours.

Finally, to find the total hours for the entire semester, we multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks in the semester:
- Total semester hours = \(17 \times 16 = 272\) hours.

Therefore, Kimo spends a total of 272 hours attending classes in one semester."
"To find the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end, we need to calculate the length contributed by each type of baked good and then sum these lengths.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Number of rolls: 300
   - Length of each roll: 4 inches
   - Total length of rolls: \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Number of croissants: 120
   - Length of each croissant: 6 inches
   - Total length of croissants: \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Number of baguettes: 60
   - Length of each baguette: 2 feet (which is 24 inches)
   - Total length of baguettes: \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches

Now, we sum the lengths of all the baked goods in inches:
\[1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 \text{ inches}\]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[3360 \div 12 = 280 \text{ feet}\]

Therefore, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is 280 feet."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we first calculate the monthly requirement for each type of ape and then double it for the 2-month period.

1. **Monkeys' requirement:**
   - 200 bananas per month
   - For 2 months: \(200 \times 2 = 400\) bananas

2. **Gorillas' requirement:**
   - 400 bananas per month
   - For 2 months: \(400 \times 2 = 800\) bananas

3. **Baboons' requirement:**
   - 100 bananas per month
   - For 2 months: \(100 \times 2 = 200\) bananas

Now, we add up the total number of bananas needed for all the apes over 2 months:

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Since the football field is 100 yards long, running back and forth once is 200 yards. Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so the total distance Blake runs is:

\[ 200 \, \text{yards} \times 15 = 3000 \, \text{yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards, and she does this 34 times, so the total distance Kelly runs is:

\[ 80 \, \text{yards} \times 34 = 2720 \, \text{yards} \]

Now, we need to find out how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Since Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards, the difference in the distance they run is:

\[ 3000 \, \text{yards} - 2720 \, \text{yards} = 280 \, \text{yards} \]

Therefore, the winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser."

"Finn initially watches 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 of them come out from under a lily pad, and 2 of them hide under a rock. 

To find out how many tadpoles Finn can see now, we need to consider the following:

- Initially, all 11 tadpoles are in the pond.
- 6 tadpoles come out from under the lily pad, so now there are 11 - 6 = 5 tadpoles that are still hidden.
- Then, 2 of the hidden tadpoles (from the 5 that were hidden) hide under a rock, so now there are 5 - 2 = 3 tadpoles that are still hidden.

Therefore, the number of tadpoles Finn can see now is the initial 11 minus the 3 that are now hidden, which is 11 - 3 = 8.

Finn can see 8 tadpoles in the pond now."
"On Monday, the tank has a depth of 17 feet.

On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

First, let's determine how many times the price will increase in 36 months. Since the price increases every two months, we divide 36 by 2:

\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

This means the price will increase 18 times over 36 months.

The original price of the bag of marbles is $20. Each time the price increases, it increases by 20% of the original price, which is:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \]

So, each increase adds $4 to the price. After 18 increases, the total increase in price is:

\[ 18 \times 4 = 72 \]

Therefore, the final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is the original price plus the total increase:

\[ 20 + 72 = 92 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{92} \]"

First, let's calculate the total cost of the red cars:
5 red cars * $4 per car = $20

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the action figures:
3 action figures * $5 per figure = $15

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5, the doll costs:
3 action figures * $5 per figure = $15

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the toys:
$20 (red cars) + $15 (action figures) + $15 (doll) = $50

Therefore, the total worth of all the toys is $50."

- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €102
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 + €74 + €102

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

We can simplify the second equation:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, we substitute the first equation \( S = 2B \) into the second equation:
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:
\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the hat is given as $25.
2. The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat, so:
   \[ \text{Cost of jacket} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \]
3. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so:
   \[ \text{Cost of pants} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \]

Now, we sum up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to get the total cost of each uniform:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \]

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is $150."
"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs for each group of creatures and then sum them up.

1. For the spiders:
   - There are 80 spiders.

   - Each insect has 6 legs.
   - Total legs from insects = 90 * 6 = 540 legs.

3. For the rare mutant invertebrates:
   - There are 3 rare mutant invertebrates.
   - Each has 10 legs.
   - Total legs from rare mutant invertebrates = 3 * 10 = 30 legs.

Now, we add up all the legs:
- Total legs = 640 (spiders) + 540 (insects) + 30 (rare mutant invertebrates) = 1210 legs.

Therefore, the total number of legs Jake sees is 1210."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

   - Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

2. Calculate 50% more than the total minimum monthly payment:
   - 50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500
   - Total payment per month = $1000 + $500 = $1500

3. Calculate the total payment for a year:
   - Total payment per year = $1500 * 12 = $18000

Therefore, Jessica pays $18000 in a year."
"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the total time spent on peeling and cutting each potato, and then multiply by the number of potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time spent peeling one potato:
- It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.

Next, let's calculate the time spent cutting one potato:
- It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut one potato.

Now, let's convert the peeling time into seconds for easier calculation:
- 1.5 minutes = 1.5 * 60 seconds = 90 seconds

So, for 60 potatoes, the total time spent peeling is:
- 90 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 5400 seconds

The total time spent cutting is:
- 5 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 300 seconds

Adding the peeling and cutting times together gives us the total prep time:
- 5400 seconds (peeling) + 300 seconds (cutting) = 5700 seconds

To convert the total time back into minutes:
- 5700 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 95 minutes

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost per gallon of lemonade:**
   - Cost of lemons per gallon: $3
   - Cost of sugar per gallon: $2
   - Total cost per gallon: $3 + $2 = $5

2. **Determine the revenue per gallon of lemonade:**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50
   - They get 20 glasses per gallon
   - Revenue per gallon: 20 glasses * $0.50/glass = $10

3. **Determine the profit per gallon of lemonade:**
   - Profit per gallon: Revenue per gallon - Cost per gallon
   - Profit per gallon: $10 - $5 = $5

4. **Determine the number of gallons sold to make $25 in profit:**
   - Total profit: $25
   - Number of gallons sold: Total profit / Profit per gallon
   - Number of gallons sold: $25 / $5 = 5 gallons

5. **Determine the total cost of lemons:**
   - Cost of lemons per gallon: $3
   - Total cost of lemons: Number of gallons sold * Cost of lemons per gallon
   - Total cost of lemons: 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15

Therefore, they spent $15 on lemons."
"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we first need to determine the total number of Chinese participants in the race.

Given:
- Total number of Asians: 240
- Number of Japanese: 80

The rest of the participants are Chinese, so we can calculate the number of Chinese participants as follows:
\[ \text{Number of Chinese} = \text{Total number of Asians} - \text{Number of Japanese} \]
\[ \text{Number of Chinese} = 240 - 80 = 160 \]

We are also given that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = \text{Number of Chinese} - \text{Number of boys} \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 160 - 60 = 100 \]

Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100."
"Let's break down Zaid's expenses and donations step by step.

1. **Rent**: Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car fuel**: He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Remaining amount after rent and car fuel**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Donation to charity**: He donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation to charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Remaining amount after donation**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Giving money to his daughter and wife**:
   \[
   \text{Total given to daughter and wife} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Final remaining amount**:
   \[
   \text{Final remaining} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, after all these expenses and donations, Zaid will still have \(\boxed{350}\) dollars."

"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we need to first find out the number of white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, and Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies. Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( W \).

From the information given:
\[ 5W = 200 \]

Solving for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now, we know Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can denote the number of red roses as \( R \).

From the information given:
\[ R = 4W \]

Substituting the value of \( W \):
\[ R = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Jan is 30 years old.
2. Two years ago, Jan's age was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.
3. The problem states that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.
4. Half of Jan's age two years ago was 28 / 2 = 14 years.
5. Therefore, two years ago, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.
6. Since two years have passed, Mark is now 19 + 2 = 21 years old.
7. Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean is 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

Jean is 23 years old."
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay race.

**Faster Team:**
Each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time for the faster team = 4 runners × 55 seconds/runner = 220 seconds.

**Less Well-Rounded Team:**
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Total time for the less well-rounded team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

**Difference in Time:**
The faster team's total time - the less well-rounded team's total time = 220 seconds - 222 seconds = -2 seconds.

Since the result is negative, it means the faster team actually wins by 2 seconds.

**Final Answer:**
The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by calculating the ratio of the probabilities and then converting it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[ \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \]

This means the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200\% \]

So, it is 200% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and use the information given to find the number of rats in each cage.

1. **Hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Let's denote the number of hamsters in each cage as \( h \).
   - The total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is \( 10 \times h \times 5 \).

2. **Rabbits:**
   - There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.

3. **Rats:**
   - The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \( r \).
   - The total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \( 3 \times r \times 6 \).

4. **Total Straw:**
   - The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents (hamsters and rats) is 160.

We can set up the equation for the total straw as follows:
\[ 10 \times h \times 5 + 3 \times r \times 6 + 20 = 160 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 50h + 18r + 20 = 160 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 50h + 18r = 140 \]

Since we are only asked to find the number of rats in each cage, we need to focus on the part of the equation that involves \( r \):
\[ 18r = 140 - 50h \]

To find integer solutions, we need to test values of \( h \) that make \( 140 - 50h \) divisible by 18.

Testing \( h = 1 \):
\[ 18r = 140 - 50 \times 1 = 90 \]
\[ r = \frac{90}{18} = 5 \]

Testing \( h = 2 \):
\[ 18r = 140 - 50 \times 2 = 40 \]
\[ r = \frac{40}{18} \] (not an integer)

Testing \( h = 3 \):
\[ 18r = 140 - 50 \times 3 = -10 \] (not possible)

Thus, the only integer solution is when \( h = 1 \) and \( r = 5 \).

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is \( \boxed{5} \)."
"To calculate the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to account for the monthly interest of 2% on the initial debt of $100.

Let's break it down month by month:

**Month 1:**
- Initial amount: $100
- Interest for the month: $100 * 2% = $2
- Total amount after 1 month: $100 + $2 = $102

**Month 2:**
- Amount at the start of the month: $102
- Interest for the month: $102 * 2% = $2.04
- Total amount after 2 months: $102 + $2.04 = $104.04

**Month 3:**
- Amount at the start of the month: $104.04
- Interest for the month: $104.04 * 2% = $2.0808
- Total amount after 3 months: $104.04 + $2.0808 = $106.1208

Rounding to the nearest cent, the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months is $106.12.

**Final numerical answer:**

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of bags the trader sold. Let's denote the number of bags as \( x \).

1. **Cost of buying the bags**: The cost per bag is $20, so the total cost for \( x \) bags is \( 20x \).

2. **Cost of transporting the bags**: The cost to transport each bag is $2, so the total transportation cost for \( x \) bags is \( 2x \).

3. **Total cost**: The total cost for the trader is the sum of the cost of buying the bags and the transportation cost, which is \( 20x + 2x = 22x \).

4. **Revenue from selling the bags**: The selling price per bag is $30, so the total revenue from selling \( x \) bags is \( 30x \).

5. **Profit**: The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. According to the problem, the trader made a total profit of $400. So, we can write the equation for profit as:
   \[
   30x - 22x = 400
   \]
   Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
   \[
   8x = 400
   \]
   Solving for \( x \), we divide both sides by 8:
   \[
   x = \frac{400}{8} = 50
   \]

So, the trader sold \(\boxed{50}\) bags."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The tickets cost $20.25 in total. The food cost $4.50 less than the tickets, so the food cost is:

\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the rides. Since each ride costs $33 and they went on 2 different rides, the total cost for the rides is:

\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:

\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:

First, we calculate the total weekly requirement for the flock:
\[ 10 \text{ ducks} \times 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we divide the total weekly requirement by 7 to find the daily requirement:
\[ \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year, so the net increase is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees per year.

3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the net increase in trees is \(8 \times 10 = 80\) trees. Adding this to the initial number of trees, we get \(50 + 80 = 130\) trees.

4. **Trees that die**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, the number of trees that die is \(0.30 \times 130 = 39\) trees.

5. **Final number of trees**: Subtracting the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years, we get \(130 - 39 = 91\) trees.

Therefore, after 10 years, Tom has 91 trees left."

"To find the cost of 8 pens, we first need to determine the cost of one pen.

Given:
- A pencil costs $1.20.
- An eraser costs $0.30.
- A pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined.

So, the cost of one pen is:
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \text{Cost of a pencil} + \text{Cost of an eraser} \]
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \$1.20 + \$0.30 \]
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \$1.50 \]

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens:
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \text{Cost of one pen} \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \$1.50 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = \$12.00 \]

Therefore, the cost of 8 pens is \$12.00."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. After a month, she collected three times that number, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\), so in the third month, she collected \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Elaine has now:

- Initial cards: 20
- Cards after the first month: 60
- Cards after the second month: 40

"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we need to consider that she can remove her lowest score from the five tests before calculating the average. Let's first identify her lowest score among the first five tests:

- 89
- 71
- 92
- 100
- 86

The lowest score is 71. We will remove this score and calculate the average of the remaining four scores plus the sixth test score, aiming for an average of 93.

Let's denote the score Brinley needs on the sixth test as \( x \).

The sum of the scores of the four highest tests is:
\[ 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367 \]

Including the sixth test score, the sum of the five scores (after removing the lowest) will be:
\[ 367 + x \]

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, the average of the remaining four scores plus the sixth test score will be:
\[ \frac{367 + x}{5} = 93 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 367 + x = 93 \times 5 \]
\[ 367 + x = 465 \]
\[ x = 465 - 367 \]
\[ x = 98 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 98 on her sixth test to get an average of 93."
"To find the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the distance for each period and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the distance for the first four weeks:
- He rode 5 times a week.
- Each ride was 25 kilometers.
- He did this for 4 weeks.

So, the total distance for the first four weeks is:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance for the following three weeks:
- He rode 2 times a week.
- Each ride was 60 kilometers.
- He did this for 3 weeks.

So, the total distance for the next three weeks is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ km/ride} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km} \]

Now, we add the distances from both periods to get the total distance:
\[ 500 \text{ km} + 360 \text{ km} = 860 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the total kilometers Micheal did in total is:
\[ 860 \text{ km} \]"
"Each chocolate bar weighs 40g, and since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 20g.

Joe has 25 chocolate bars, so the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars * 40g/chocolate bar = 1000g

Joe also has 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 candied apples * 20g/candied apple = 1600g

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is the sum of the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

Therefore, Joe's bag of candy weighs 2600 grams."
"On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

To find the total number of cakes she bought over the three days, we add the number of cakes from each day:

\(4 + 12 + 60 = 76\)

So, Rose bought a total of 76 cakes after all three days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates would be 6 plates.
   - Therefore, the cost of half a dozen plates is \(6 \times 6000 = 36000\) dollars.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is \(36000 - 1200 = 34800\) dollars.

3. **Determine the cost of one dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups cost $34800.
   - Therefore, one dozen cups cost \(\frac{34800}{20} = 1740\) dollars.

4. **Determine the cost of one cup:**
   - One dozen cups is 12 cups.
   - Therefore, the cost of one cup is \(\frac{1740}{12} = 145\) dollars.

The total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{145}\) dollars."
"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The cost of the jacket is $30.
The cost of 2 pairs of shoes is 2 * $20 = $40.
So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Next, we need to calculate how much money Sara will earn from babysitting and mowing the lawn.

Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.
Let's denote the number of times she mows the lawn as \( x \). She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, so she earns 4x dollars from mowing the lawn.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the total amount of money she will have after babysitting and mowing the lawn is $10 + $20 + 4x.

We need this total to be at least $70 to afford the jacket and shoes. So, we set up the following equation:
\[ 10 + 20 + 4x = 70 \]
\[ 30 + 4x = 70 \]
\[ 4x = 70 - 30 \]
\[ 4x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{4} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

Final numerical answer:
4"
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, as he walks around the edge. The park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles by 6 miles.

The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we divide the total distance by his speed:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Gary spends 5 hours walking."
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total.

So, the number of customers on the third day is \(500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\).

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. We know that both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 \) gallons. This can be written as:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we have:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool now has \( 8 \) gallons of water.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to afford the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the shoes and the belt is $352.00.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Her part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find the number of hours, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed.

The additional amount is 10% of $2000, which is:
\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Janeth will have paid in total over 12 months if she pays $165 each month. The total payment over 12 months is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total payment from the total amount to be returned:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"There are 4 roses in the vase. There are 7 more dahlias than roses, so there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias. 

To find the total number of flowers, we add the number of roses and dahlias together: 4 + 11 = 15.

Total number of flowers in the vase: 15."
"Given that Harriet is currently 21 years old, we can determine the ages of Adrian and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's age = 21 years
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age = 21 * 2 = 42 years
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's age = 21 * 3 = 63 years

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet's age = 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack's age = 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian's age = 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \]

The average age of the three in three years is 45 years."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by each of the other students and then subtract their total from the overall score.

1. **Naomi's Score:**
   Naomi scored 68 points.

2. **Yuri's Score:**
   Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, we calculate half of Naomi's points and then add 10.
   \[
   \text{Yuri's points} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]

3. **Brianna's Score:**
   Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, we add 17 to Naomi's points.
   \[
   \text{Brianna's points} = 68 + 17 = 85

"Initially, the water tank has 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters, so the amount of water left in the tank is:

120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters

Celine then collects rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. Therefore, the amount of rainwater collected is:

2 * 30 liters = 60 liters

Adding the rainwater to the remaining water in the tank gives:

30 liters + 60 liters = 90 liters

So, the final amount of water in the tank is:

90 liters"
"Andy plants 90 geraniums. He plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, which means he plants 90 - 40 = 50 petunias.

First, let's calculate the cost for Carlos:
- Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour.
- He uses the canoe for 3 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Carlos is \(30 \times 3 = 90\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Benji:
- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour.
- He uses the raft for 5 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Benji is \(18 \times 5 = 90\) dollars.

Now, we add the costs together to find the total amount they will pay:
- Total cost = Cost for Carlos + Cost for Benji
- Total cost = \(90 + 90 = 180\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount they will pay for their rentals, altogether, is 180 dollars."

"First, let's calculate the new total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type cards and buying 14 grass type cards.

Initial count:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20
- Water type: 40

After the changes:
- Fire type: 30 (unchanged)
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

Now, let's find the total number of cards:
Total cards = 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96

The percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 33.33 \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is:
\[ 33 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest after two months.
2. Subtract the number of harvested watermelons from the total to find the remaining watermelons.
3. Calculate the number of watermelons that became ready for harvest after two weeks.
4. Subtract the number of these newly harvested watermelons from the remaining watermelons to find the final number not ready for harvest.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest after two months:
   \[
   30\% \text{ of } 120 = \frac{30}{100} \times 120 = 36
   \]
   So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest after two months.

2. Subtract the number of harvested watermelons from the total to find the remaining watermelons:
   \[
   120 - 36 = 84
   \]
   So, 84 watermelons remained after the first harvest.

3. Calculate the number of watermelons that became ready for harvest after two weeks:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \text{ of } 84 = \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63
   \]
   So, 63 watermelons became ready for harvest after two weeks.

4. Subtract the number of these newly harvested watermelons from the remaining watermelons to find the final number not ready for harvest:
   \[
   84 - 63 = 21
   \]

Therefore, the number of melons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is 21."
"To calculate the total amount Mark pays for everything, we need to consider the cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees.

1. **Cost of the cars**: 12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000
2. **Tax on the cars**: 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000
3. **Registration fees**: $1,000 per car * 12 cars = $12,000

Now, we add these amounts together to get the total cost:

$240,000 (cost of cars) + $24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (registration fees) = $276,000

Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for everything is $276,000."

12 penguins are still left sunbathing."
"Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. Since he eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes per day. Together, they eat 6 (Steve) + 3 (girlfriend) = 9 tomatoes per day.

To find out how many tomatoes they need in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (days in a week):
9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 tomatoes/week.

Since a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed to produce 63 tomatoes is:
63 tomatoes/week ÷ 3 tomatoes/vine/week = 21 vines.

So, Steve needs 21 vines to produce enough tomatoes for both him and his girlfriend."

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens.
2. **First Cycle of Refilling**: After using these 25 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make 5 new pens (since 25 / 5 = 5).
3. **Second Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 5 new pens plus the 20 pens that were not used up in the first cycle (since 25 - 5 = 20). So, he has 25 pens again. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make 5 new pens again.
4. **Third Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 5 new pens plus the 20 pens that were not used up in the second cycle (since 25 - 5 = 20). So, he has 25 pens again. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make 5 new pens again.
5. **Fourth Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 5 new pens plus the 20 pens that were not used up in the third cycle (since 25 - 5 = 20). So, he has 25 pens again. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make 5 new pens again.
6. **Fifth Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 5 new pens plus the 20 pens that were not used up in the fourth cycle (since 25 - 5 = 20). So, he has 25 pens again. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make 5 new pens again.

After the fifth cycle, he will have 5 new pens plus the 20 pens that were not used up in the fifth cycle (since 25 - 5 = 20). So, he has 25 pens again. However, he cannot make any more new pens because he needs 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen, and he only has 25 pens, which is not enough to make another 5 pens.

So, the total number of pens he can have is the initial 25 pens plus the 5 new pens he made in each of the 5 cycles, which is 25 + 5 * 5 = 25 + 25 = 50 pens.

The final numerical answer is:
50"
"Johnny started with an allowance of $20 and added an extra $10, so he had a total of:

"To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.
2. Calculate the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A.
3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students.
4. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C, which is the remaining students after those who went out through exits A and B.

Let's start with step 1:

1. 30% of the students went out through exit A. So, the number of students who went out through exit A is:
   \[
   0.30 \times 1000 = 300

So, Robert has 27 candies.

James has 6 more candies than Robert, so:
\[ \text{James's candies} = R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James."
"Dolly has two books, and Pandora has one book. If both Dolly and Pandora read each other's books as well as their own, we need to consider the total number of books read by both of them.

Dolly will read:
- Her own 2 books
- Pandora's 1 book

Pandora will read:
- Her own 1 book
- Dolly's 2 books

So, the total number of books read by Dolly is 2 (her own) + 1 (Pandora's) = 3 books.
The total number of books read by Pandora is 1 (her own) + 2 (Dolly's) = 3 books.

Collectively, they will read 3 (Dolly's total) + 3 (Pandora's total) = 6 books.

By the end, they will collectively read 6 books."
"Mike was originally pen pals with 5 people and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. This means he is now pen pals with 3 people.

Each of these 3 people sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each person sends 10 pages a week (2 letters * 5 pages).

Since Mike is pen pals with 3 people, he receives 30 pages a week (3 people * 10 pages).

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages a week in response.

To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total time he spends writing 30 pages.

Mike writes a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, to write 30 pages, he spends 30 * 6 = 180 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 180 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:

180 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours.

So, Mike spends 3 hours writing a week."
"First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason uses for his 15-minute calls with his boss each day. Since there are 30 days in the month, he uses:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes he used for calls to other people:

\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the monthly plan of 1000 minutes:

\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Jason has 250 minutes left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin now has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Griffin now has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries.
4. Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. So, Griffin now has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Griffin now has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

**Final Answer:**
20"
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

The total number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 4 + 32 = 36 \).

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. The difference in the number of snails is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

So, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times (2F) \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The number of fish in each aquarium is 7."
"To calculate the total amount Jean paid for the makeup services, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily cost of the makeup artist's services.
2. Calculate the weekly cost of the makeup artist's services.
3. Calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks of work.
4. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.

Let's start with the daily cost:

- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
- It takes 6 hours each day to do the makeup.
- Therefore, the daily cost is \( 250 \times 6 = 1500 \) dollars.

Next, we calculate the weekly cost:

- She needs the makeup done 4 times a week.
- Therefore, the weekly cost is \( 1500 \times 4 = 6000 \) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks:

- The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
- Therefore, the total cost before the discount is \( 6000 \times 5 = 30000 \) dollars.

Finally, we apply the 10% discount:

- The discount is 10% of the total cost.
- Therefore, the discount amount is \( 30000 \times 0.10 = 3000 \) dollars.
- The final amount Jean paid is \( 30000 - 3000 = 27000 \) dollars.

So, Jean paid a total of $27,000."
"To find out how much each person paid, we first need to calculate the total cost of the party supplies.

The total cost is the sum of the costs for each item:
- Cake ingredients: $12
- Birthday presents: $43
- Decorations: $15
- Invitations: $4
- Goodie bags: $22

Adding these together:
$12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, so the cost is divided among 3 people.

To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3:
$96 ÷ 3 = $32

Each person paid $32."
"The chef bought 4 bags of onions, with each bag weighing 50 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of onions is:

4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

The cost of onions is $1.50 per pound, so the total cost is:

200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 5 cookies, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 13 cookies, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

In total, Sue ate \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.

Her sister ate \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies in total.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

Her sister consumed \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.

The difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister is \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories.

Therefore, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."
"To find the number of boys in the third class, let's break down the information given and solve step by step.

1. Each class has 20 students.
2. There are 3 classes, so the total number of students in the school is \(20 \times 3 = 60\).
3. The school is 50% boys and 50% girls, so there are \(60 \times 0.5 = 30\) boys and \(30\) girls in total.
4. The first class has 15 girls, so it has \(20 - 15 = 5\) boys.
5. The second class has 12 girls, so it has \(20 - 12 = 8\) boys.
6. The total number of boys in the first and second classes is \(5 + 8 = 13\).
7. Since there are 30 boys in total, the number of boys in the third class is \(30 - 13 = 17\).

Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is 17."
"Travis originally had 61 apps. After deleting 9 apps, he had:

"Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Since he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

Therefore, the number of wolves he killed today is 3 times the number of cougars, which is 3 * 12 = 36 wolves.

Now, let's add up all the animals he killed:

- Wolves: 10 (last night) + 36 (today) = 46 wolves
- Cougars: 15 (last night) + 12 (today) = 27 cougars

Total animals killed: 46 wolves + 27 cougars = 73 animals.

"First, let's determine how many times Anne went down the slide. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. Mitchel went down the slide 30 times, so we calculate 30% of 30:

\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]

Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, so we subtract 9 from 30:

\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Anne went down the slide 21 times. Now, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, so we multiply 21 by 4:

\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 84 \]"
"Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, which totals to:

\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, each stall gets:

\[ \frac{40}{20} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Adding these 2 new cows to the original 20 cows in each stall, each stall now has:

\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ cows} \]

To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:

\[ 22 \times 8 = 176 \]

Therefore, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:

176"
"To find out how much money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the total value of each type of coin and bill, and then sum these values.

1. **Pennies**: 100 pennies are worth 100 * $0.01 = $1.00
2. **Nickels**: 40 nickels are worth 40 * $0.05 = $2.00
3. **Dimes**: 20 dimes are worth 20 * $0.10 = $2.00
4. **Dollar bills**: 40 dollar bills are worth 40 * $1.00 = $40.00

Now, we add up all these values:

$1.00 (from pennies) + $2.00 (from nickels) + $2.00 (from dimes) + $40.00 (from dollar bills) = $45.00

Brady has $45.00 in his piggy bank."
"First, let's calculate the total number of 10-foot sections in the 200-foot tall redwood:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any of it is:

\[ 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Termites ate 30% of the redwood, so they ate:

\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.30 = 2400 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the remaining weight of the redwood is:

\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Given that Andrea has 52 apples, we can start by determining how many apples Jamal has. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Andrea's apples} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]

Substituting the number of apples Andrea has:

\[ 52 = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]

Solving for Jamal's apples:

\[ \text{Jamal's apples} = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

Next, we know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. So, we can calculate the number of bananas Jamal has:

\[ \text{Jamal's bananas} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can calculate the number of bananas Andrea has:

\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{\text{Jamal's bananas}}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits:

\[ \text{Total fruits} = \text{Andrea's apples} + \text{Andrea's bananas} + \text{Jamal's apples} + \text{Jamal's bananas} \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 168 \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits is 168."
"To determine how many cups of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making over the two days and then find out how much flour is required for that number of cookies.

1. Calculate the total number of cookies:
   - Today: 36 cookies
   - Tomorrow: 30 cookies
   - Total: 36 + 30 = 66 cookies

2. Determine the amount of flour needed for 66 cookies:
   - 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies.
   - To find out how many cups are needed for 66 cookies, we set up a proportion:
     \[
     \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}}

     x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{132}{12} = 11 \text{ cups}
     \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate two thirds of 9,300 pennies.

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9,300 = \frac{2 \times 9,300}{3} = \frac{18,600}{3} = 6,200 \text{ pennies} \]

Since there are 100 pennies in a dollar, we convert 6,200 pennies to dollars by dividing by 100.

\[ 6,200 \div 100 = 62 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is:

"First, let's determine the number of trees Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, and Chris has 6 trees, Ferdinand has:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ trees} \]

Next, we calculate the number of trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has 3 trees, twice that number is:

\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Adding 5 to this number gives us the number of trees Harry has:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ trees} \]

Now, to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:

\[ 11 - 3 = 8 \]

So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. 

Final numerical answer:

"To determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then compare it to her budget.

1. Calculate the brokerage fee:
\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \times \$350,000 = 0.05 \times \$350,000 = \$17,500 \]

2. Calculate the transfer fee:
\[ \text{Transfer fee} = 12\% \times \$350,000 = 0.12 \times \$350,000 = \$42,000 \]

3. Calculate the total price of the house:
\[ \text{Total price} = \text{Selling price} + \text{Brokerage fee} + \text{Transfer fee} \]
\[ \text{Total price} = \$350,000 + \$17,500 + \$42,000 = \$409,500 \]

4. Determine how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Total price} - \text{Budget} \]

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to subtract the transfer fees, brokerage fees, and the remaining loan amount from the selling price.

1. **Transfer Fees**: 3% of $400,000
\[ \text{Transfer Fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

2. **Brokerage Fee**: 5% of $400,000
\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

3. **Remaining Loan Amount**: $250,000

Now, we subtract these amounts from the selling price to find the net proceeds.

\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Transfer Fees} - \text{Brokerage Fee} - \text{Remaining Loan Amount} \]
\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = 400,000 - 12,000 - 20,000 - 250,000 \]
\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = 400,000 - 282,000 \]
\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = 118,000 \]

Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are $118,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and calculate the time for each part.

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:** This takes 20 minutes.

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:** It takes 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees. 
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:** It takes 5 minutes less time than the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - The total heating time to 400 degrees is 28 minutes.
   - So, the cooking time is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

4. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:** This is the sum of the heating time to 300 degrees, the additional heating time to 400 degrees, and the cooking time.
   - Total time = \(20 + 28 + 23 = 71\) minutes.

Therefore, the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 71 minutes."
"To find out how much the real estate agent spent on all the ads, we need to calculate the total cost for the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the newspaper ads:
- The cost per newspaper ad is $5.
- The number of newspaper ads bought is 50.
- Therefore, the total cost for newspaper ads is \(5 \times 50 = 250\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the television ads:
- The cost per television ad is $75.
- The number of television ads bought is 15.
- Therefore, the total cost for television ads is \(75 \times 15 = 1125\) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs for the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost for newspaper ads + Cost for television ads
- Total cost = \(250 + 1125 = 1375\) dollars.

The real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on buying all the ads."
"The juggler can juggle 16 balls in total. Half of these balls are golf balls, so there are 16 / 2 = 8 golf balls. Half of these golf balls are blue, so there are 8 / 2 = 4 blue golf balls.

"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary bought, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then sum them up.

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has \(300 / 2 = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, we add the M&Ms from all three bags together:
\[300 + 312 + 150 = 762\]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows between the houses, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum them up.

1. Calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, each house has \(3 \times 2 = 6\) windows in the bedrooms.
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms is \(6 \times 2 = 12\).

2. Calculate the number of additional windows in each house:
   - There are 4 additional windows in each house.
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is \(4 \times 2 = 8\).

3. Add the windows from the bedrooms and the additional windows to get the total number of windows:
   - Total windows = Windows in bedrooms + Additional windows
   - Total windows = \(12 + 8 = 20\)

Therefore, the total number of windows between the houses is 20."

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we first need to calculate the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

1. The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches the body of the sweater takes. So, the collar takes:
\[ \frac{900}{10} = 90 \text{ stitches} \]

2. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar. So, the rosette takes:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \text{ stitches} \]

3. The total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We can now calculate the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette:
\[ 90 + 180 = 270 \text{ stitches} \]

4. Subtract the stitches used for the collar and the rosette from the total number of stitches to find the number of stitches used for the sleeves:
\[ 1800 - 270 = 1530 \text{ stitches} \]

5. Since the sweater has two sleeves, we divide the remaining stitches by 2 to find the number of stitches per sleeve:
\[ \frac{1530}{2} = 765 \text{ stitches} \]

Each sleeve takes 765 stitches."
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add these amounts together.

- Total cost for tomato seeds: $800
- Total cost for celery seeds: $2400
- Total cost for all seeds: $800 + $2400 = $3200

Therefore, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is $3200."
"To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each part and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\) lines from the first scene.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\) lines from the second scene.

Now, we sum up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
- Solo song: 54 lines
- First scene: 36 lines
- Second scene: 48 lines

Total lines = \(54 + 36 + 48 = 138\)

   \[ 24 - 15 = 9 \]

Therefore, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is:
\[ 9 \]"
"To calculate the total time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time for the small holes:
   - Time for one small hole = 3 minutes
   - Total time for 30 small holes = 30 * 3 minutes = 90 minutes

2. Calculate the total time for the large holes:
   - Time for one large hole = 10 minutes
   - Total time for 15 large holes = 15 * 10 minutes = 150 minutes

3. Add the total times for small and large holes:
   - Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

4. Convert the total time from minutes to hours:
   - 240 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 4 hours

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes."
"The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 20 + 20 = 40.

In 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older, so the total sum of their ages will increase by 20 years. Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40."
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

Final numerical answer:
Sam is 6 years old."
"To find the total amount Peter paid, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the popsicles:
- Peter purchased 20 popsicles at $0.25 each.
- The total cost for the popsicles is \( 20 \times 0.25 = 5 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars:
- Peter purchased 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each.
- The total cost for the ice cream bars is \( 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \) dollars.

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of popsicles + cost of ice cream bars
- Total cost = \( 5 + 2 = 7 \) dollars.

Therefore, Peter paid a total of 7 dollars."
"First, let's determine the number of spots on a mamba. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can calculate the number of spots on a mamba as follows:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park. There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas, so:

\[ \text{Total spots on cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]
\[ \text{Total spots on mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of spots for all the snakes:

\[ \text{Total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots:

\[ \text{Half the number of spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

2450"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people at the soccer game:

- There are 12 team members.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 guests.
- There are also 3 coaches.

So, the total number of people is 12 (team members) + 24 (guests) + 3 (coaches) = 39 people.

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3:

39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pizza costs $15, so:

13 * $15 = $195.

Maddy will spend $195."
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones and then find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads.

1. Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace. Therefore, the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones is:
   \[
   8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. The total length of each necklace is 25 inches. Subtracting the length occupied by the topaz gemstones from the total length gives us the length available for the sterling silver beads:
   \[
   25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find out how many sterling silver beads can fit into the 17 inches of space, we divide the available length by the length of each bead:
   \[
   \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{\frac{1}{4} \text{ inch/bead}} = 17 \times 4 = 68 \text{ beads}
   \]

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace."
"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. 

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we add the stories from both weeks:
- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\)
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\)
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\)

Adding these totals together:
\(60 + 120 + 180 = 360\)

The total number of stories they wrote altogether is 360."
"Ann's brother is currently twice Ann's age. Since Ann is 9 years old, her brother is:

"Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents:
- 1 quarter = 25 cents
- 5 quarters = 5 * 25 = 125 cents
- 1 dime = 10 cents
- 2 dimes = 2 * 10 = 20 cents

So, the total amount of money Kelly has is:
125 cents (from quarters) + 20 cents (from dimes) = 145 cents

Now, if she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, the amount of money she will have left is:
145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents

Therefore, Kelly will have 90 cents left."
"To find the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars and then subtract the stars in the other rows.

1. Calculate the total number of stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and 2 rows of 6 stars:
   - 3 rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars
   - 2 rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars
   - Total stars in these rows: \(24 + 12 = 36\) stars

2. The total number of stars on the flag is 76. Subtract the stars in the other rows to find the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
   - Stars in 5-star rows: \(76 - 36 = 40\) stars

3. To find the number of 5-star rows, divide the number of stars in 5-star rows by 5:
   - Number of 5-star rows: \(40 \div 5 = 8\)

Therefore, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag."
"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, we first need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones and then divide that by the weight capacity of one truck.

1. Calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones:
   \[ 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

2. Determine how many trucks are needed by dividing the total weight by the weight capacity of one truck:

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip."
"The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour. The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover 480 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the slow lane:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"First, let's determine how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, Izzy has:

\[ 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Now, let's find out how many medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. Therefore, the total number of medals given out is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

8 packets * 5 bars per packet = 40 bars

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the adults will get:

4 adults * 6 bars per adult = 24 bars

Now, we subtract the number of bars the adults get from the total number of bars to find out how many are left for the children:

40 bars - 24 bars = 16 bars

There are 8 children, and we need to divide the remaining 16 bars equally among them:

16 bars / 8 children = 2 bars per child

Each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"To determine how much money Susan earns, we need to calculate the total time she works and then multiply that by her earnings rate.

1. First, let's calculate the total time Susan works:
   - She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours.
   - She pauses for half an hour, so the actual working time is 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours.

2. Convert the working time into minutes:
   - 2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes.

3. Calculate the earnings:
   - Susan earns $5 for every 10 minutes.
   - In 150 minutes, the number of 10-minute intervals is 150 / 10 = 15.
   - Therefore, her earnings are 15 * $5 = $75.

Susan earns $75 for the online task."
"Let's break down the points for each player after the first three rounds and then add the extra points for the fourth round.

1. Mike has 21 points.
2. Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
3. Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Now, let's add the extra points for the fourth round. Players get an extra point if they have over 20 points.

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point. Mike's total becomes \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point. Jim's total remains 18 points.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point. Tony's total becomes \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Now, let's sum up the total points for all three players after the fourth round:

- Mike: 22 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 43 points

Total points = \(22 + 18 + 43 = 83\)

Final numerical answer:
83"

Will bought 15 oranges in total.

Therefore, the number of oranges left unwashed is \(15 - 12 = 3\).

3 oranges are left unwashed."
"To find the total count of activities Darren has done over the two days, we need to calculate the number of each activity he did on the second day and then sum all the activities from both days.

First, let's calculate the number of each activity on the second day:
- Pushups: 100 (first day) + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 (first day) - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 (first day) * 2 = 40

Now, let's sum the activities for each day:
- First day: 100 pushups + 50 squats + 20 dumbbell presses = 170
- Second day: 120 pushups + 40 squats + 40 dumbbell presses = 200

Finally, we add the totals from both days:
170 (first day) + 200 (second day) = 370

The total count of activities Darren has done in the two days is 370."
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members, each consuming 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and eating rice at both lunch and dinner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily consumption of rice for the household.
2. Determine the total weekly consumption of rice.
3. Calculate how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last based on the weekly consumption.

**Step 1: Calculate the total daily consumption of rice for the household.**

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since each person eats rice at both lunch and dinner, each person consumes:
\[ 0.2 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 0.4 \, \text{kg/day} \]

For 5 members of the household, the total daily consumption is:
\[ 0.4 \, \text{kg/person/day} \times 5 \, \text{persons} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total weekly consumption of rice.**

There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly consumption is:
\[ 2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{kg/week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.**

To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's calculate the total number of crates sold:

- Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates.
- On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
- On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
- On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

Now, let's add these numbers together:

20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:

120 (target) - 65 (sold) = 55 crates

So, Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week."
"To determine the total cost of the antique desk for Carmen, we need to calculate the sum of all the bids she made. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Bid**: Carmen starts with an opening bid of $200.
2. **Bids by Others**: There are 3 other people who each bid once. Since the bids rise by $50 each time, the bids by the other people are:
   - First other person: $200 + $50 = $250
   - Second other person: $250 + $50 = $300
   - Third other person: $300 + $50 = $350

3. **Carmen's Bids**: Carmen bids after each of the other three people, so her bids are:
   - After the first other person: $300
   - After the second other person: $350
   - After the third other person: $400

4. **Total Cost**: The total cost is the sum of all the bids Carmen made, including the initial bid and her subsequent bids:
   - Initial bid: $200
   - First bid: $300
   - Second bid: $350
   - Third bid: $400

Adding these together:
\[ 200 + 300 + 350 + 400 = 1250 \]

Therefore, the desk costs Carmen $1250."
"To calculate the total cost John pays for the driving service in a year, we need to consider both the mileage charges and the monthly bonuses.

1. **Mileage Charges:**
   - Distance to work one way: 30 miles
   - Total distance per day: 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles
   - Distance per week: 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week
   - Distance per year: 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year
   - Cost per mile: $2
   - Total mileage cost per year: 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000

2. **Monthly Bonuses:**
   - Bonus per month: $150
   - Number of months in a year: 12
   - Total bonus cost per year: $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost per year = Total mileage cost + Total bonus cost
   - Total cost per year = $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800

Therefore, John pays a total of $31,800 a year for the driving service."
"To find out how many minutes Peter has to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

So, the total time exercised on Monday and Sunday combined is:
23 minutes + 16 minutes = 39 minutes.

Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined on Tuesday. Therefore, we need to multiply the total time by 2:
39 minutes * 2 = 78 minutes.

So, Peter has to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the structure of the folding process. Each piece of paper, when folded in half, can accommodate two pages: one on the left front and one on the left back, and similarly for the right front and right back.

Given that a 32-page tabloid requires two pages per piece of paper, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper needed by dividing the total number of pages by 2.

\[ \text{Number of pieces of paper} = \frac{\text{Total number of pages}}{2} = \frac{32}{2} = 16 \]

So, 16 pieces of paper would be used in a 32-page tabloid."
"Annika started with $50. She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

So, she spent $25 on food and snacks. She also spent an additional $10 on rides. Therefore, the total amount spent is:

\[ 25 + 10 = 35 \]

To find out how much is left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:

"To find out the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of books sold in the first year.
2. Determine the number of books sold in the second year.
3. Calculate the earnings for the second year.

First, we know that Elise started with 250 books and currently has 50 unsold books. This means she has sold \(250 - 50 = 200\) books in total over the three years.

We are also given that she sold 45 books in the current (third) year. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, she sold \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books in the first year.

Now, we can find out how many books she sold in the second year by subtracting the books sold in the first and third years from the total books sold:
\[200 - 90 - 45 = 65\]

Since each book sells for $20, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is:
\[65 \times 20 = 1300\]

Therefore, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is $1300."
"To calculate how much money Watson made in April, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Watson's daily earnings.
2. Calculate his weekly earnings without the bonus.
3. Calculate his weekly earnings with the bonus.
4. Determine the number of weeks in April.
5. Calculate his total earnings for April.

Step 1: Watson's daily earnings
Watson earns $10 per hour and works 10 hours a day.
Daily earnings = $10/hour * 10 hours/day = $100/day

Step 2: Watson's weekly earnings without the bonus
Watson works 5 days a week.
Weekly earnings without bonus = $100/day * 5 days/week = $500/week

Step 3: Watson's weekly earnings with the bonus
Watson gets a $300 bonus each week.
Weekly earnings with bonus = $500/week + $300/week = $800/week

Step 4: Number of weeks in April
April typically has 4 weeks.

Step 5: Total earnings for April
Total earnings for April = $800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April if the company performed very well for the whole month."
"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. 

To find out how many people he beat, we calculate 80% of 20:
\[ 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \]

Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total and beat 16 of them, the number of people he lost to is:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

He lost to 4 people."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.
2. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. So, the number of loaves sold in the morning is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]
3. The remaining loaves after the morning sales are:
   \[
   60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
   \]
4. Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon (and also in the evening) is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]

Therefore, the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is 10."
"Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so he loses 2 pounds per week (8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds/week).

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will take 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds.

To lose the same amount of weight that Joey does in a single week (2 pounds), Sandy will take 4 weeks.

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week.

4 weeks"

You will save $6 if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk."
"To determine the number of new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many times the serum will cause the growth of an extra arm and an extra leg within that period.

1. **Growth of Extra Arms:**
   - The serum causes an extra arm every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra arms grown is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).

2. **Growth of Extra Legs:**
   - The serum causes an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra legs grown is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs.
   - Total new limbs = 5 (extra arms) + 3 (extra legs) = 8.

Therefore, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, the cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
\[ 5 \times \$100 + \$700 = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

The total amount Theo wants to save is $2000. Therefore, the total amount he can spend on the trip is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

Now, let's sum up the costs of the suits, suitcases, and flight ticket:
\[ \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$2050 \]

The amount left for buying gifts is:
\[ \$4000 - \$2050 = \$1950 \]

Therefore, Theo has to spend \(\boxed{1950}\) on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the number of people eating three eggs each day:**
   - There are 3 people eating 3 eggs each day.

2. **Calculate the total number of eggs these 3 people consume in a day:**
   - \(3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person} = 9 \text{ eggs}\)

3. **Identify the number of people eating two eggs each day:**
   - The family has 5 people in total, and 3 of them are already accounted for, so \(5 - 3 = 2 \text{ people}\) are eating 2 eggs each day.

4. **Calculate the total number of eggs these 2 people consume in a day:**
   - \(2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person} = 4 \text{ eggs}\)

5. **Calculate the total number of eggs the entire family consumes in a day:**
   - \(9 \text{ eggs} + 4 \text{ eggs} = 13 \text{ eggs}\)

6. **Calculate the total number of eggs the family consumes in a week (7 days):**
   - \(13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 91 \text{ eggs}\)

Therefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"If Quinn is 30 years old, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, then Jane is:

30 - 3 = 27 years old.

Since Trent is 5 years older than Jane, Trent's age is:

27 + 5 = 32 years old.

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old."
"Let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step.

1. Cera is currently 46 years old.
2. Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
3. Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.
4. Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age, which means the population was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

Now, we need to find the current population of Chile. The problem states that the population six years ago was half of what it is now. Therefore, the current population is twice the population six years ago.

So, the current population of Chile is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

Final numerical answer:
120000"
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem, the number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).

The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{1}{2}D \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3.5D = 105 \]

To find \( D \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3.5:

\[ D = \frac{105}{3.5} = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

Final numerical answer:
30"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we know that 8 people couldn't come due to illness. Additionally, 1/4 of that number (8) had previous commitments. So, the number of people with previous commitments is:

\(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\)

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

To find out how many people actually show up, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:

\(24 - 10 = 14\)

So, the final numerical answer is:

14"
"First, let's calculate the number of marbles Solomon received from his father. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, and his father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought. So, the number of marbles his father gave him is:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8
\]

Now, let's calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has. He originally had 50 marbles in the store, bought 20 more from Johanna, and received 8 more from his father. Therefore, the total number of marbles is:

\[
50 + 20 + 8 = 78
\]

Each marble weighs 2 kilograms, so the total weight of the marbles is:

\[
78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg}
\]

The total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is:

\[
\boxed{156 \text{ kg}}

"To calculate the cost to fill the pool, we first need to determine the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep, so the volume \(V\) is given by:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \times 5 \, \text{ft} \]
\[ V = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

The cost to fill the pool is $.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \(C\) is:

\[ C = V \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{\$/cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 12 \, \text{\$} \]

The cost to fill the pool is $12."
"Given that the classroom has 30 boys, we can use the information provided to find the number of girls and nongendered children.

1. The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys:
   \[ \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

2. The number of nongendered children is 1/10 the number of boys:
   \[ \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \]

To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
\[ \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

Total number of children: 123"
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

Since the ratio is 1:3, for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires. Therefore, if there are 45 wires, we can set up the following proportion to find the number of poles:

\[ \text{Number of poles} = \frac{\text{Number of wires}}{3} \]

Substituting the given number of wires:

\[ \text{Number of poles} = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15."
"At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, 1/4 of 40 people left, which is 10 people.

If 22 men stayed at the party, then the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3 men.

Since 10 people left in total and 3 of them were men, the remaining 7 people who left must be women.

Therefore, the number of women who left is 7.

The number of women who stayed at the party is 15 (initial number of women) - 7 (number of women who left) = 8 women.

Final numerical answer:
8 women are left at the party."
"The magazine costs half as much as a book, and the book costs $4. Therefore, the magazine costs:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

A pen costs $1 less than a magazine, so the pen costs:

\[ 2 - 1 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

The pen costs $1."
"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. According to the problem, Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together give a total of 26 pencils. 

We can set up the equation for the pencils in Jam's boxes as follows:
\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + \text{Loose pencils} = \text{Total pencils} \]
\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + 2 = 26 \]

To find the number of pencils in the boxes, we subtract 2 from 26:
\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} = 26 - 2 = 24 \]

Now, we know that Jam has 24 pencils in boxes and 2 loose pencils, making a total of 26 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many pencils Jam and Meg have in total:
\[ \text{Total pencils} = \text{Pencils Jam has} + \text{Pencils Meg has} \]
\[ \text{Total pencils} = 26 + 46 = 72 \]

To store all 72 pencils, we need to determine how many boxes are required. Since we know that Jam's 24 pencils were stored in 3 boxes, we can assume that each box holds the same number of pencils. Therefore, each box holds:
\[ \text{Pencils per box} = \frac{24}{3} = 8 \]

Now, to find out how many boxes are needed to store 72 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:
\[ \text{Number of boxes needed} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ice cubes Shannon uses to cool the coffee by 65 degrees and then calculate the weakening effect of both the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, we calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so the number of ice cubes required is:

\[ \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Next, we calculate the weakening effect of the ice cubes. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:

\[ 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Now, we consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Adding any liquid weakens the coffee, so the 15 milliliters of cream will make the coffee an additional 15 milliliters weaker.

Adding the weakening effects together, the total weakening of the coffee is:

\[ 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio and apply it to the number of new records the people received.

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means for every new record received, 2 old records are given up.

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records given up as follows:

\[ \text{Total old records} = 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of junior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees.
   - Therefore, the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \).

2. **Determine the number of senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of junior programmers is 40.
   - Therefore, the number of senior programmers is \( 100 - 40 = 60 \).

3. **Calculate the monthly payment for junior programmers:**
   - Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month.
   - Therefore, the total payment for junior programmers is \( 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \).

4. **Calculate the monthly payment for senior programmers:**
   - Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid \( 2000 + 400 = 2400 \) per month.
   - Therefore, the total payment for senior programmers is \( 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \).

5. **Calculate the total monthly payment for all programmers:**
   - The total payment for junior programmers is $80,000.
   - The total payment for senior programmers is $144,000.
   - Therefore, the total monthly payment for all programmers is \( 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \).

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $224,000."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal be \( x \).

2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).

3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

4. Simplifying the expression, we get \( x + 6 \).

5. We are given that there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop. So, \( x + 6 = 20 \).

6. Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 20 - 6 = 14 \).

Therefore, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\).
3. He passes 14 out to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\).
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends: \(14 \times 2 = 28\). So, he now has \(8 + 28 = 36\).
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\).
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\).

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31."
"To fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, it needs an additional 40 percentage points of charge. Given that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to recharge the remaining 40 percentage points as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes per percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ 120 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."
"Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her another 10 lollipops, so she then has:

She has 14 lollipops left."
"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

\[ \text{Rewards earned} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards. The coupon applied twice the amount of the rewards off the price. So, the discount from the coupon is:

\[ \text{Discount from coupon} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the rewards and the discount from the amount spent:

\[ \text{Amount to be paid} = 43 - 4 - 8 = 31 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job has a higher net pay and by how much, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per year: 2000
- Total annual pay before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Tax rate: 20%
- Tax amount: $30,000 * 20% = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual pay before tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate: 10%
- Tax amount: $36,000 * 10% = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate (Job B)."
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of ruined castles.
2. Determine how many of these ruined castles are unmanned.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of ruined castles.
40 percent of the 220 castles are ruins. So, we calculate 40% of 220:
\[ 0.40 \times 220 = 88 \]
So, there are 88 ruined castles.

Step 2: Determine how many of these ruined castles are unmanned.
Half of the ruined castles are unmanned. So, we calculate half of 88:

"First, let's calculate the value of the shares after the first year. Maria initially buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the initial total value is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. To find the new price per share after the increase, we calculate:

\[ \$8 \times (1 + 0.50) = \$8 \times 1.50 = \$12 \]

So, the value of the 8 shares after the first year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. To find the new price per share after the decrease, we calculate:

\[ \$12 \times (1 - 0.25) = \$12 \times 0.75 = \$9 \]

So, the value of the 8 shares after the second year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72 \]

Therefore, the final value of all Maria's shares is:

\[ \$72 \]"
"Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke."
"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group will then have \( x - 10 \) students.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group, therefore, has:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"To solve this problem, let's start by setting up some equations based on the information given.

Let \( C \) represent the number of cows and \( H \) represent the number of chickens. We know the following:

1. The total number of animals is 60.
2. The number of chickens is twice the number of cows.

From this, we can write the following equations:
\[ C + H = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ \text{Total legs} = 4C + 2H \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is 160."
"Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. After 4 weeks, he will be juggling:

However, during the performance, he drops 3 balls. So, the number of balls he has left is:

7 - 3 = 4 balls

But 2 of those balls are caught by people in the crowd, so he still has:

4 - 2 = 2 balls

Therefore, Josh starts to juggle with 2 balls."
"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself.

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

The total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, plus the container itself, is 260 pounds."

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June is 180000 meters."
"To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, let's first determine the prices of each juice box:

- Juice Box A is priced at $4.
- Juice Box B is $5 more than Juice Box A, so it is priced at $4 + $5 = $9.
- Juice Box C is $7 more than Juice Box A, so it is priced at $4 + $7 = $11.

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C:

$11 (Juice Box C) - $9 (Juice Box B) = $2.

"To find out how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts after a 40% discount, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount.
2. Calculate the discount amount.
3. Subtract the discount amount from the total cost to find the final amount paid.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost without the discount.
Each shirt costs $30, and Davos bought 2 shirts.
Total cost without discount = $30 * 2 = $60

Step 2: Calculate the discount amount.
The discount is 40%, so we calculate 40% of $60.
Discount amount = 40% of $60 = 0.40 * $60 = $24

Step 3: Subtract the discount amount from the total cost.
Final amount paid = Total cost without discount - Discount amount
Final amount paid = $60 - $24 = $36

Therefore, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts."

   - There are 4 weeks in a month, so the monthly cost for food is \(25 \times 4 = 100\) dollars.
   - There are 12 months in a year, so the yearly cost for food is \(100 \times 12 = 1200\) dollars.

2. **Treats Cost:**
   - Treats cost $20 per month.
   - The yearly cost for treats is \(20 \times 12 = 240\) dollars.

3. **Medicine Cost:**
   - Medicine costs $100 per month.
   - The yearly cost for medicine is \(100 \times 12 = 1200\) dollars.

Now, we sum up all the yearly costs:
- Yearly cost for food: $1200
- Yearly cost for treats: $240
- Yearly cost for medicine: $1200

Total yearly cost = \(1200 + 240 + 1200 = 2640\) dollars.

Therefore, Madeline spends \(\boxed{2640}\) dollars on her dog per year."
"To find the total number of hours Peyton's after-work activities will take, we need to calculate the duration of each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Yoga class on Monday**: 1 hour
2. **Cooking class on Tuesday**: 3 times the yoga class, so \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours
3. **Cheese-tasting event on Wednesday**: 0.5 hours (30 minutes)
4. **Museum tour on Thursday**: Half the duration of the cooking class, so \(\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\) hours
5. **Errands on Friday**: 2 hours

Now, we sum up all the hours:

\[1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 8\]

Therefore, all of Peyton's after-work activities will take a total of 8 hours."
"April is donating plant pots for the daisies and roses. The school asked for 30 plant pots for the daisies and twice as many for the roses, which means:

- Daisies: 30 plant pots
- Roses: 2 * 30 = 60 plant pots

So, the total number of plant pots needed is 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90 plant pots.

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the number of plant pots needed from the number of plant pots she bought:

100 (bought) - 90 (needed) = 10

April has 10 plant pots left over."
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to subtract the amount she spent and gave away from the total amount she had initially.

1. Andrea had $36 initially.
2. She spent $11 on a sweater.
3. She gave her brother $4.

So, the total amount spent and given away is $11 + $4 = $15.

Now, subtract this total from the initial amount:

$36 - $15 = $21

Andrea saved $21."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming. He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Next, he watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is:

\[ 3 \times 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let's denote the total time spent on vacation as \( T \). Therefore, we have:

\[ 0.30T = 15 \text{ hours} \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ hours}}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. So, the time spent sightseeing is:

\[ 0.40 \times 50 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time John spent sightseeing is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle earns from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works 20 hours, so:

\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money she earns from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works 15 hours, so:

\[ 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, let's add the money she already has in her savings, the money she earned from her first job, and the money she earned from her second job:

\[ 80 \, \text{dollars} + 200 \, \text{dollars} + 75 \, \text{dollars} = 355 \, \text{dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so to find out how much more money Annabelle needs to save, we subtract the total amount she has from the cost of the phone:

\[ 400 \, \text{dollars} - 355 \, \text{dollars} = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save:

\[ 45 \, \text{dollars} \]"
"The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet.

The second tree has a height of 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so:
\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet} \]

The combined height of the shortest and the second tree is:
\[ 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet} \]

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined, so:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet} \]

The height of the tallest tree is 34 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dean bought:

- The cost of 6 toy cars at $2 each is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) dollars.
- The cost of 5 teddy bears at $1 each is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total cost of the items is \(12 + 5 = 17\) dollars.

Dean started with $28. After buying the items, he has \(28 - 17 = 11\) dollars left.

Then, his mother gives him an extra $10, so he now has \(11 + 10 = 21\) dollars.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost for Morgan and her friends to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. Then, we'll subtract this total from her budget to see how much money is left for her friends.

1. **Cost of mini-golf for one person**: $5
2. **Cost of go-karts for one person (2 rides)**: $10 * 2 = $20
3. **Total cost for one person (including mini-golf and go-karts)**: $5 + $20 = $25
4. **Total cost for one person (including mini-golf, go-karts, and $5 in arcade tokens)**: $25 + $5 = $30

Now, let's subtract the cost for Morgan from the total budget to find out how much is left for her friends.

5. **Morgan's budget**: $90
6. **Cost for Morgan**: $30
7. **Money left for friends**: $90 - $30 = $60

Each friend will also need to cover the cost of mini-golf, go-karts, and $5 in arcade tokens, which totals $30 per friend.

8. **Number of friends Morgan can invite**: $60 / $30 = 2

Therefore, Morgan can invite 2 friends to her birthday party."
"Marisa gets $5 every day as pocket money. She spends 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so the total cost of the lollipops is:

4 lollipops * $0.25 per lollipop = $1.00

The amount she saves each day is the difference between her pocket money and the cost of the lollipops:

$5.00 - $1.00 = $4.00

If she saves for 5 days, the total amount she saves is:

$4.00 per day * 5 days = $20.00

Therefore, Marisa puts $20.00 in her piggy bank if she saves for 5 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount Billy spent on gumballs:**
   - Billy bought 40 gumballs.
   - Each gumball costs $0.05.
   - Total cost for gumballs = 40 * $0.05 = $2.

2. **Calculate the total amount Billy had before buying gumballs:**
   - Since he spent half of his change on gumballs, the $2 he spent is half of his change.
   - Therefore, his total change before buying gumballs = $2 * 2 = $4.

3. **Determine the total amount Billy spent on candy:**
   - Billy started with $10 and had $4 left after buying gumballs.
   - Total spent on candy = $10 - $4 = $6.

4. **Calculate the amount of candy Billy bought:**
   - The candy costs $1.5 per pound.
   - Amount of candy bought = Total spent on candy / Cost per pound = $6 / $1.5 = 4 pounds.

Therefore, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy."
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( S \).

According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. Carver is 45 years old, so we can write the equation as:

\[ 45 = 2S - 5 \]

To find \( S \), we solve the equation:

\[ 45 + 5 = 2S \]
\[ 50 = 2S \]
\[ S = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ S = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs, which is \(75 + 100 = 175\) miles. So, the distance from the third city to the first city is \(175 - 50 = 125\) miles.

Now, let's add up the distances for one complete trip:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily travel distance:
\[\frac{18000}{900} = 20\]

So, the train goes 20 days between services.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of stuffing for a collie bed:**
   - A bed for a Rottweiler takes 8 pounds of stuffing.
   - A bed for a chihuahua takes 2 pounds of stuffing.
   - A bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed.
   - The average is calculated as \((8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5\) pounds of stuffing.

2. **Calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:**
   - Each chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing.
   - For 4 chihuahua beds, the total is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) pounds of stuffing.

3. **Calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:**
   - Each collie bed requires 5 pounds of stuffing.
   - For 3 collie beds, the total is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) pounds of stuffing.

4. **Add the amounts together to find the total amount of stuffing needed:**
   - Total stuffing for chihuahua beds: 8 pounds

"To find out how many fourth-grade boys were at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of fourth-grade boys at the school.
2. Subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

First, we know there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls. Therefore, the number of boys is:
\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

On Friday, 4 fourth-grade boys were absent. So, the number of boys present on Friday is:
\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

Therefore, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is:
49"

"To find the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass, we need to add the points she has already scored and then determine how many more points she needs to reach the minimum requirement of 42 points.

Points from the first test: 15
Points from the second test: 18

Total points from the first two tests: 15 + 18 = 33

To find the minimum points needed on the third test, we subtract the total points from the first two tests from the required total:

42 - 33 = 9

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on her third test to pass. 

The minimum number of points she must score on the third test to pass is 9."
"First, let's determine the number of people kicked out for shoplifting. We know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks. The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times that number minus 5. So, we calculate:

\[ 4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

Next, we calculate the number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. This number is three times the number of shoplifters:

\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we know the total number of people kicked out for the three specific reasons (refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence) is:

\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

Given that the total number of people kicked out is 50, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:

\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:

19"

1. Sara scored 8 points.
2. After scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times more points than Sara.

First, we calculate how many points Erin has now:
- Sara has 8 points.
- Erin has three times more points than Sara, so Erin has \(3 \times 8 = 24\) points now.

Next, we need to find out how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points:
- If Erin now has 24 points and she scored 14 points to get to this total, then before scoring those 14 points, she had \(24 - 14 = 10\) points.

Therefore, Erin had 10 points before scoring 14 points."
"To calculate the total cost for the senior gifts, we need to break down the expenses into several parts:

1. **Cost of picture frames for all seniors:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - There are 44 seniors.
   - Total cost for picture frames = 44 * $20 = $880.

2. **Cost of etching the logo on each picture frame:**
   - The etching cost is 20% of the picture frame cost.
   - 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4.
   - Total cost for etching = 44 * $4 = $176.

3. **Cost of pins for 2 seniors:**
   - Each pin costs $5.
   - Total cost for pins = 2 * $5 = $10.

4. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers.
   - Number of officers = 44 * 1/4 = 11.
   - Each cord costs $12.
   - Total cost for cords = 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we add all these costs together to find the total amount spent:

- Total cost = Cost of picture frames + Cost of etching + Cost of pins + Cost of cords
- Total cost = $880 + $176 + $10 + $132
- Total cost = $1208

Therefore, the total amount spent on the senior gifts is $1208."
"To find out how much Ethan would save by making his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate 20% of the market price and then subtract that from the original price.

The market price of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400.

20% of $400 is calculated as:
\[ 400 \times \frac{20}{100} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

So, Ethan would save $80 by making his own wallpaper.

The total cost for Ethan to make his own wallpaper would be the original price minus the savings:
\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday, which is:

On the last day of the sale, they sold one-half the amount that they did on Saturday, which is:
\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ pairs} \]

However, six pairs were returned because they didn't fit, so the actual number of pairs sold on the last day is:
\[ 14 - 6 = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

To find the total number of pairs sold during the sale, we add the pairs sold on each day:
\[ 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \text{ pairs} \]

Therefore, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is:
50 pairs."

"To find out how many pupils like the color yellow, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pupils who like blue.
2. Determine the number of pupils remaining after those who like blue are accounted for.
3. Calculate the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils.
4. Subtract the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils to find out how many like yellow.

Let's start with step 1:

1. Half of the class likes blue. Since there are 40 pupils in the class, the number of pupils who like blue is:

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the interest for the five months. The interest rate is 10% per year, so for five months, the interest rate is:

\[ \text{Interest rate for 5 months} = \frac{10\% \times 5}{12} = \frac{10}{12}\% = \frac{10}{1200} = \frac{1}{120} \]

Now, we calculate the interest on the principal amount of $3,650:

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times \frac{1}{120} = \frac{3650}{120} = 30.4167 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 30.4167 = 3680.4167 \]

Since she has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3680.4167}{5} = 736.08334 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = 736.08 \]

Therefore, Karan has to pay $736.08 per month."

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Cho hiked = 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 km

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Chloe hiked = 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 km

Difference = Distance Cho hiked - Distance Chloe hiked
Difference = 112 km - 45 km = 67 km

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos.

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, which means she has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, which means she has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos they have together:

- Total silver pesos: \(50 + 100 = 150\)
- Total gold pesos: \(80 + 120 = 200\)

The total number of pesos they have together is \(150 + 200 = 350\).

"First, let's calculate the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She has 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, the total number of cups of lemonade she can make is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost. Millie spent $18 on supplies. So, the total cost is:

\[ \$18 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she sells all the lemonade, we can determine the profit per hour by dividing the total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade. First, we find out how many hours it takes to sell all 36 cups:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we calculate the profit per hour:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

So, the profit Millie makes per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he kept \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land. The amount of land he kept is given as 12.8 hectares.

So, we can write the equation as:
\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]
\[ x = 32 \]

Therefore, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.50 * 52 = 26

The performance is done by the female members, so initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform. However, on the day of the performance, half of the performers can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

Number of girls who can't make it = 0.50 * 26 = 13

So, the number of girls who actually perform is:

Number of girls who perform = 26 - 13 = 13

Additionally, 3 teachers decide to sing with the girls. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Total number of people who sang = Number of girls who perform + Number of teachers = 13 + 3 = 16

Final numerical answer:
16"

"To find the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils, we can calculate the cost of the erasers and the pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of 6 erasers is:
6 erasers * $2/eraser = $12

The cost of 8 pencils is:
8 pencils * $3/pencil = $24

Adding these together gives the total cost:
$12 + $24 = $36

Therefore, the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is $36."
"James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson.

To find out how many messages he delivers to Mr. Yu, we calculate 1/3 of 66:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

So, James delivers 22 messages to Mr. Yu.

To find the total number of messages delivered, we add the messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu:
\[ 66 + 22 = 88 \]

Therefore, the total number of messages James delivers is 88."
"To determine how much money David saves, let's break down the costs for both David and Dasha.

First, let's calculate the cost for Dasha:
- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, each ride costs \(2 \times 2 = $4\).
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \times 4 = $36\).

Now, let's calculate the cost for David:
- David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.
- Therefore, the total cost for David is $30.

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract the cost for David from the cost for Dasha:
- Savings = Cost for Dasha - Cost for David
- Savings = $36 - $30
- Savings = $6

David saves $6."
"First, let's calculate the total number of gifts Monica needs to wrap:

- Gifts for her family: 6
- Gifts for her friends: 4
- Gifts for her teachers: 2

Total number of gifts = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to make bows for all 12 gifts. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of gifts:

144 inches of ribbon ÷ 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given ratio and the total number of popsicles to find out how many popsicles each person has.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of popsicles is the sum of Betty's and Sam's popsicles:
\[5x + 6x = 165\]
\[11x = 165\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 11:
\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles.
- Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[90 - 75 = 15\]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

Final numerical answer:
15"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services before the bundle discount:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu costs $10 a month.
- Disney Plus costs $10 a month.

So, the total cost for these three services before the discount is:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, since Tim gets a 20% discount for bundling these services, we need to calculate the discount amount and the final cost after the discount:

- The discount on the total cost is 20%, so the discount amount is:
\[ 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

- The final cost after the discount is:
\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we compare this to the cost of the cable package, which is $60 per month. The amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable package and subscribing to the streaming services is:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time Carol spent on her work.

Carol spends 4 hours writing a song. Since she spends half that much time recording it, she spends \(4 \div 2 = 2\) hours recording. She also spends 90 minutes editing, which is \(90 \div 60 = 1.5\) hours (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

Now, let's add up all the time spent:
- Writing: 4 hours
- Recording: 2 hours
- Editing: 1.5 hours

Total time spent = \(4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5\) hours.

Next, we need to find out what percentage of her total work time was spent editing. The time spent editing is 1.5 hours, and the total work time is 7.5 hours. The percentage is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total work time}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100
\]

Simplifying the fraction:

\[
\frac{1.5}{7.5} = \frac{1}{5}
\]

So,

\[
\left( \frac{1}{5} \right) \times 100 = 20\%
\]

Therefore, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing."

"First, let's calculate the total number of Valentine's cards Erica initially had:

- Erica made 20 cards.
- Her dad brought 2 boxes with 15 cards each, so that's \(2 \times 15 = 30\) cards.

Adding these together, Erica initially had \(20 + 30 = 50\) cards.

Next, let's account for the cards she passed out and received:

- She passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
- She passed out 5 cards to her family.
- She received 17 cards from family and friends.

So, the total number of cards she gave away is \(24 + 5 = 29\), and the total number of cards she received is 17.

Now, let's calculate the net change in the number of cards:

- Cards given away: 29
- Cards received: 17
- Net change: \(17 - 29 = -12\)

This means Erica lost 12 cards in total.

Finally, to find out how many cards Erica now has, we subtract the net change from the initial total:

- Initial total: 50
- Net change: -12

So, \(50 - 12 = 38\).

Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards."
"First, let's calculate how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices, Bill gets:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Next, Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. So, Mark gets:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices herself. So, the total number of slices given away or eaten is:
\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \text{ slices} \]

Finally, to find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices given away or eaten from the original number of slices:
\[ 12 - 9 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the number of slices left is:

"First, let's calculate the number of millipedes Nancy saw. Since she saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, and she saw 90 spiders, the number of millipedes is:

\[ \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \]

Next, we calculate the number of stink bugs. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, we have:

\[ \text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \]

Now, we add up all the bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of bugs} = \text{Number of spiders} + \text{Number of millipedes} + \text{Number of stink bugs} \]
\[ \text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 \]

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is:

\[ \boxed{168} \]"

"First, let's calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when it is used for 8 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. Therefore, for 8 hours, it uses:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the daily energy consumption to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Now, if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, the air conditioner will be used for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

The energy consumption for 3 hours a day is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Therefore, the total kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:
\[ 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]"
"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

1. Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each:
   - Total stripes for these two zebras: \(2 \times 17 = 34\)

2. She also counts a zebra with 36 stripes:
   - Total stripes for this zebra: \(36\)

3. Another zebra has half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes:
   - Total stripes for this zebra: \(\frac{36}{2} = 18\)

Now, we add up all the stripes:
- Total stripes: \(34 + 36 + 18 = 88\)

Next, we count the total number of zebras:
- Total zebras: \(2 + 1 + 1 = 4\)

To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
- Average stripes: \(\frac{88}{4} = 22\)

The average number of stripes on the zebras is 22."
"To determine how much money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sandwiches needed to serve 20 people.
2. Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.
3. Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of sandwiches needed.**
Each sandwich serves 4 people. Therefore, the number of sandwiches needed for 20 people is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of meat and cheese required.**
Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of meat and cheese needed is:
\[ 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of meat per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \]
\[ 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of cheese per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese.**
The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, and the cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound. Therefore, the total cost for the meat and cheese is:
\[ 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \times \$7.00 \text{ per pound} = \$35.00 \]
\[ 5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \times \$3.00 \text{ per pound} = \$15.00 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$35.00 + \$15.00 = \$50.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of cannolis**: Allan has 40 cannolis.
2. **Corns in relation to cannolis**: There are twice as much corn as cannolis. So, the number of corns is \(2 \times 40 = 80\).
3. **Additional cannolis**: Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).
4. **Additional corns**: Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. So, the number of additional corns is \(60 - 40 = 20\). Therefore, the new total of corns is \(80 + 20 = 100\).

Now, to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis:

- Total cannolis: 100
- Total corns: 100

Combined total: \(100 + 100 = 200\)

"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we can break down the information given:

1. Elliott finished half of his 10,000 steps on his walks to and from school. So, he walked 5,000 steps.
2. He did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
3. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps.

Let's calculate the total steps he had taken before his jog:

- Steps from walking to and from school: 5,000
- Steps from the short walk with his friend: 1,000

Total steps before the jog: 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000

Since he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps, the steps he took during his jog would be:

10,000 (total goal) - 6,000 (steps before jog) - 2,000 (steps left) = 2,000 steps

Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog."

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total payment for May.
2. Determine the number of employees remaining after June.
3. Calculate the total payment for June.
4. Sum the payments from May and June.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**

- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment for May = Number of employees × Hourly wage × Hours worked per week
Total payment for May = 40 × $15 × 40
Total payment for May = $24,000

**Step 2: Determine the number of employees remaining after June.**

- 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired in June.
- Number of employees who left = 1/4 × 40 = 10
- Number of employees remaining = 40 - 10 = 30

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for June.**

- Number of employees in June: 30
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment for June = Number of employees × Hourly wage × Hours worked per week
Total payment for June = 30 × $15 × 40
Total payment for June = $18,000

**Step 4: Sum the payments from May and June.**

Total payment for May and June = Total payment for May + Total payment for June
Total payment for May and June = $24,000 + $18,000
Total payment for May and June = $42,000

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $42,000."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. This means that for 2 pounds of taffy, Sally pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (since it's half off the $3 price).

The cost of the taffy is:
\[ \$3 + \$1.50 = \$4.50 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50, and the magnets cost $0.25 each. Since she bought 4 magnets, the total cost for the magnets is:
\[ 4 \times \$0.25 = \$1.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the seashells and the magnets to the cost of the taffy:
\[ \$4.50 + \$1.50 + \$1.00 = \$7.00 \]

Sally started with $10.00. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from the amount she started with:
\[ \$10.00 - \$7.00 = \$3.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$3.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the second pack of fireworks. Since it's worth twice the amount of the first pack, which is $400, the second pack costs:

\[ 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

Next, we add the cost of the first and second packs of fireworks:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Now, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the first and second packs. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the original price. So, we calculate 80% of $1200:

\[ 1200 \times 0.80 = 960 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted total:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. To find out how many cookies she needs for 30 days, we multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of days:

\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies she needs to make 60 cookies:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the information provided does not specify the percentage of candles that explode. We only know that 5% of the more dangerous candles (which are already a subset of the total candles) also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. 

Given:
- Total candles made = 50,000
- Percentage of candles that smell like wet dog (among the more dangerous ones) = 5%

Since the problem does not specify the percentage of candles that explode, we can only calculate the number of candles that smell like wet dog. Assuming that all candles are considered ""more dangerous"" for the purpose of this calculation, we can proceed as follows:

Number of candles that smell like wet dog = 5% of 50,000
= 0.05 * 50,000
= 2,500

Therefore, 2,500 candles will smell like wet dog. 

However, the question asks for the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. Since the percentage of candles that explode is not provided, we cannot determine this number. 

Final numerical answer: 2,500 candles will smell like wet dog."
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount price of one blouse.
2. Multiply the discount price by the number of blouses Misha picked.

First, let's calculate the discount price of one blouse. The regular price is $20, and the blouses are on a 30% off rack. So, the discount is 30% of $20.

\[ \text{Discount} = 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

So, the discount price of one blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Next, we need to find the total cost for 4 blouses at the discounted price.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples.
3. Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees, but we don't know the exact number yet. Let's call this number \(x\).

Joanne's total apples = \(30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\).

Joanne's sister gathers:
- Twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
- Three times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
- No apples from the average trees.

Joanne's sister's total apples = \(60 + 45 = 105\).

The combined total of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500 apples. So, we can set up the equation:

\[45 + x + 105 = 500\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[150 + x = 500\]

Subtract 150 from both sides to solve for \(x\):

\[x = 500 - 150\]
\[x = 350\]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

Final numerical answer:

"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads is 180, which means \( C + D = 180 \).
2. The total number of humps is 304, which means \( 2C + D = 304 \) because camels have 2 humps each and dromedaries have 1 hump each.

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can express \( D \) from the first equation:
\[ D = 180 - C \]

Next, we substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[ 2C + (180 - C) = 304 \]
\[ 2C + 180 - C = 304 \]
\[ C + 180 = 304 \]
\[ C = 304 - 180 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we know \( C = 124 \), we can find \( D \):
\[ D = 180 - C \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

Final numerical answer:
56"
"To find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the distances he covered in each segment of his trip and then sum them up.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Distance per day: 200 kilometers
   - Total distance for 4 days: \( 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \)

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Distance covered: 30% of the distance covered in the first 4 days
   - Distance for 2 days: \( 0.30 \times 800 \, \text{km} = 240 \, \text{km} \)

3. **Next day (no travel):**
   - Distance: 0 km

4. **Second week (7 days):**
   - Distance per day: 300 kilometers
   - Total distance for 7 days: \( 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \)

Now, we sum up all the distances:
\[ 800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} = 3140 \, \text{km} \]

**Total distance traveled: 3140 kilometers.**"
"Given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4.

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.

\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to determine the elevation of the comb and then calculate the difference between that elevation and Oliver's current elevation.

1. Stanley's comb fell 4,000 feet from his starting elevation of 10,000 feet.
   - Elevation of the comb = 10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet.

2. Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet.

3. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb:
   - Climbing distance = Elevation of the comb - Oliver's current elevation
   - Climbing distance = 6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet.

Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To determine how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money given by the second bank.
2. Add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital.

The first bank gave Mr. Josue $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so the amount from the second bank is:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Now, we add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, the total capital Mr. Josue has now is:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so the total number of cats carried away by the boats is:

4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats

After the boats carried away the cats, the number of cats left on the rock is:

50 cats - 20 cats = 30 cats

Then, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. The number of cats that ran after the mouse is:

(3/5) * 30 cats = 18 cats

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is:

30 cats - 18 cats = 12 cats

Final numerical answer:
12 cats"
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into the different pricing periods.

1. **First 6 months at $8 a month:**
   \[ 6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48 \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 a month:**
   \[ 8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96 \]

3. **The remaining 8 months (since 2 years is 24 months, and 6 + 8 = 14 months, so 24 - 14 = 10 months, but we only need 8 more to complete 2 years) at $14 a month:**
   \[ 8 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$112 \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ \$48 + \$96 + \$112 = \$256 \]

The total cost for 2 years of the service is:
\[ \$256 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The problem states that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out the total savings Cole made. The problem states that he saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can set up the following equations:

Let \( S_{tattered} \) be the savings from the tattered jeans and \( S_{jogger} \) be the savings from the jogger jeans. We know:

\[ S_{tattered} + S_{jogger} = 6 \]
\[ S_{jogger} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
\[ S_{tattered} = 6 - 2 = 4 \]

The original price of the tattered jeans is $28, and Cole saved $4 on them, so the sale price of the tattered jeans is:

\[ 28 - 4 = 24 \]

The original price of the jogger jeans is $22, and Cole saved $2 on them, so the sale price of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 22 - 2 = 20 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:

\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans."
"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles.

First, we calculate the capacity of the 4 buses:
4 buses * 60 employees per bus = 240 employees

Next, we calculate the capacity of the 6 minibusses:
6 minibusses * 30 employees per minibus = 180 employees

Then, we calculate the capacity of the 10 minivans:
10 minivans * 15 employees per minivan = 150 employees

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles to get the total capacity:
240 employees (buses) + 180 employees (minibusses) + 150 employees (minivans) = 570 employees

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others, making a total of 6 bird feeders.

The store-bought bird feeders attract 20 birds each. Since the feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, her homemade feeders attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of birds attracted by each type of feeder:

- For the 3 store-bought feeders: 3 feeders * 20 birds/feeder = 60 birds
- For the 3 homemade feeders: 3 feeders * 30 birds/feeder = 90 birds

Adding these together gives the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day:

60 birds + 90 birds = 150 birds

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day."
"To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. The cost of the bagel is given as $4.
2. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. So, the cost of the soup is:
   \[
   4 + (0.25 \times 4) = 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The cake costs half of the price of the bagel. So, the cost of the cake is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake:
\[
5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay \(\boxed{11}\) dollars for her dinner."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Kenny needs $100 to buy the ticket to the amusement park.
2. He plans to sell his cards for $1.5 each.
3. He keeps 1/3 of the cards and has $50 in spending cash after selling the rest.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

- He keeps 1/3 of the cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards.
- The money he gets from selling \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \).

After selling the cards, he has $50 in spending cash and the cost of the ticket ($100) to cover. So, the money he gets from selling the cards is $150 ($100 for the ticket + $50 in spending cash).

Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The caterer was initially told to prepare enough hot dogs for 36 guests, with half of them getting two hot dogs each. This means 18 guests would get two hot dogs, and the other 18 would get one hot dog each.

2. The total number of hot dogs prepared would be:
   - 18 guests * 2 hot dogs = 36 hot dogs
   - 18 guests * 1 hot dog = 18 hot dogs
   - Total = 36 + 18 = 54 hot dogs

3. However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. This means that each of the 40 guests would need 2 hot dogs in total.

4. The total number of hot dogs required for 40 guests, each wanting 2 hot dogs, would be:
   - 40 guests * 2 hot dogs = 80 hot dogs

5. The caterer only prepared 54 hot dogs, but 80 were needed. The shortfall in hot dogs is:
   - 80 hot dogs - 54 hot dogs = 26 hot dogs

6. Since each guest needs 2 hot dogs, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is the same as the number of hot dogs short, which is 26.

Therefore, 26 guests did not get a second hot dog."
"Indras' name has 6 letters.

Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3 letters.

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, so her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Therefore, the total number of letters in both names is 6 (Indras) + 7 (sister) = 13 letters.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Set of mixing bowls: $20.00
- 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Now, let's add these amounts together to get the total before the discount:

$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Next, we apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165.00, we calculate:

$165.00 * 0.80 = $132.00

So, the final amount of Charlotte's order is:

$132.00"
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy. The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. Adding these together:

\[ 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 \]

So, the total cost of the items is $19.

Next, we need to determine how much money Dora currently has. She has saved $2 from her allowance and her mother gave her $16. Adding these amounts together:

\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]

So, Dora currently has $18.

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount of money she has from the total cost of the items:

\[ 19 - 18 = 1 \]

Therefore, Dora needs \(\boxed{1}\) more dollar to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, which is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, which is:
\[ 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \]

Prince Bruce has slain 30 dragons."
"First, we need to determine how much gasoline is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needs in gallons. Josey needs \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons by 8:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"First, let's calculate how much money George had left after his purchase. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Money left} = 5 \times 0.01 = 0.05 \]

So, George spent:

\[ 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \]

Next, we know George bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each. The total cost for the chips is:

\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \]

Subtracting the cost of the chips from the total amount spent gives us the amount spent on candy bars:

\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars George bought is:

\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars."
"Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, the number of lollipops he shared with his friends is:

20 ÷ 4 = 5 lollipops

Each of his friends received 5 lollipops."
"Rory's cake weighs 20 ounces in total. She cuts it into 8 pieces, so each piece weighs:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} \]

Rory and her mom each have one piece, so they have taken 2 pieces in total. The weight of the pieces they have is:

\[ 2 \times 2.5 \text{ ounces} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the remaining cake weighs:

\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have together:

Sitti has 34 oranges, and Juris has 22 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is:
\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Next, we need to determine how many people will be sharing these oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing the oranges with 6 other friends, so the total number of people sharing the oranges is:
\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

Now, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of people to find out how many oranges each person will get:
\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, each person will get 7 oranges.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 7 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine will use. He doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. Therefore, he will use:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the cost for the onions will be:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is on sale for $2.00. Therefore, the cost for the beef stock will be:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to find the total cost of the ingredients:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Therefore, the cost per serving is:

\[ \$2.00 \]"
"Wayne's drive to the theater takes 4 minutes. Since Bernadette's drive takes four times as long, her drive takes 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room in feet. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

We can rearrange this formula to solve for the width:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{Length}} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"To determine how many more beads one sister has than the other, we first need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, Elizabeth's total is:
- 1 pack * 20 beads/pack + 2 packs * 20 beads/pack = 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

Margareth's total is:
- 3 packs * 20 beads/pack + 4 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, we find the difference in the number of beads between Margareth and Elizabeth:
- 140 beads - 60 beads = 80 beads

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the temperature changes step by step.

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking**: Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour.
   - Temperature increase per hour = 5 degrees
   - Total time baking = 3 hours
   - Total temperature increase = 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees
   - New temperature after baking = 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

3. **Opening the Window**: Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   - Cooling rate = 2 degrees every 10 minutes
   - Total time the window is open = 30 minutes
   - Number of 10-minute intervals in 30 minutes = 30 minutes / 10 minutes = 3 intervals
   - Total temperature decrease = 2 degrees/interval * 3 intervals = 6 degrees
   - Final temperature after opening the window = 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

Therefore, the house's final temperature is 49 degrees."
"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon:

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time James took for the swim is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so:

\[ 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's:

\[ 170 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we can calculate the time James took for the run by subtracting the time he took for the swim and the bike from his total time:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} - 85 \text{ minutes} = 59 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the time it took James to do the run is 59 minutes."
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C into minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is:

\[ 1.25 \times 60 = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so:

\[ \text{Length of Movie B} = 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, so:

\[ \text{Length of Movie A} = \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Movie A was 20 minutes long."
"First, let's determine how far the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the distance the horse runs is:
\[ 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate how much hay the horse eats. For every mile, the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse eats:
\[ 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails of hay} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost for 8 bails is:
\[ 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we subtract the cost of the hay from the amount of money Michael has:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the change Michael has after he buys the hay is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has:

- She uses 4 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen equals \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs.
- She also uses 2 additional eggs.

So, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Since each glass requires 5 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 5:

\[
\frac{50}{5} = 10 \text{ glasses}
\]

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays she can put out:

\[
\frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ trays}
\]

Therefore, Rozanne can put out 2 trays."
"To determine by how many points Joey is now winning, we need to calculate the total points for both Joey and Marcy after their respective turns and then find the difference between their scores.

First, let's calculate Joey's total points:
- Joey starts with 214 points.
- He scores an additional 26 points.
- Therefore, Joey's total points are \(214 + 26 = 240\).

Next, let's calculate Marcy's total points:
- Marcy starts with 225 points.
- She scores an additional 10 points.
- Therefore, Marcy's total points are \(225 + 10 = 235\).

Now, we find the difference between Joey's and Marcy's total points to determine by how many points Joey is winning:
- Joey's total points: 240
- Marcy's total points: 235
- The difference is \(240 - 235 = 5\).

So, Joey is now winning by \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"To calculate the salesman's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per sneaker.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the sneakers.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost per sneaker.**

The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. So, the cost per sneaker is:
\[ \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the sneakers.**

- He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each at a flash sale on Monday:
\[ \text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars} \]

- The rest of the sneakers (48 - 17 = 31) were sold to a department store for $25 each:
\[ \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars} \]

- Total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit.**

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ \text{Profit} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the salesman's profit is:
\[ \boxed{539} \]"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Super Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $20
   - Popcorn with soda: $1 extra
   - Total cost with super ticket: $20 + $1 = $21

2. **Regular Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $12
   - Popcorn: Let's call the regular price of popcorn \( P \)
   - Soda: $3
   - Total cost without super ticket: $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \)

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - Therefore, the cost of the regular ticket option minus the cost of the super ticket option equals $2.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the first day.
2. Calculate the new cost of filling one balloon after the price increase.
3. Calculate the total cost for filling 170 balloons at the new price.

First, let's find the cost of filling one balloon on the first day. We know that 20 balloons cost $900, so the cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{\$900}{20} = \$45 \]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = \$45 + \$20 = \$65 \]

Now, we need to find out how much it would cost to fill 170 balloons at the new price:

\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times \$65 = \$11,050 \]

So, Bentley paid \(\$11,050\) to fill 170 balloons after the price increase."
"To find the car's average speed during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, calculate the distance for each segment of the trip:
- For the first segment, the car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance is \(60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}\).
- For the second segment, the car drives at 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance is \(30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}\).

Next, add the distances to get the total distance:
- Total distance = \(120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}\).

Now, calculate the total time taken:
- Total time = \(2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}\).

Finally, calculate the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
- Average speed = \(\frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph}\).

The car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."
"Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. After the trade, she has:

- \(8 - 3 = 5\) sapphires
- \(0 + 2 = 2\) rubies

The value of her sapphires is:
- \(5 \times 800 = 4000\) dollars

The value of her rubies is:
- \(2 \times 1200 = 2400\) dollars

The total value of all her jewels is:
- \(4000 + 2400 = 6400\) dollars

Therefore, the total value of all her jewels is 6400 dollars."
"Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. 

In 30 days, Marin will eat:
4 apples/day * 30 days = 120 apples

"First, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed. The volume of a raised bed is given by its width, length, and height:

\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume of soil} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{\$/bag} = 1920 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, the potting soil will cost Bob $1920."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Red Cards**: There are 15 red cards.

2. **Green Cards**: There are 60% more green cards than red cards. To find the number of green cards, we calculate 60% of 15 and add it to 15.
   - 60% of 15 = 0.60 * 15 = 9
   - Therefore, the number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

3. **Yellow Cards**: The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards.
   - Sum of red and green cards = 15 + 24 = 39
   - Therefore, the number of yellow cards = 39

4. **Total Cards**: To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards together.
   - Total cards = 15 (red) + 24 (green) + 39 (yellow) = 78

Therefore, the total number of cards of all mentioned colors is 78."
"Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. After twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn, which is:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

These 25 fairies joined the 50 fairies that were already there, so the total number of fairies became:

\[ 50 + 25 = 75 \]

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away, so the number of fairies remaining is:

\[ 75 - 30 = 45 \]

Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is:

45"
"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

Total number of puppies = 8 (Jennifer's) + 12 (Brandon's) = 20 puppies
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 (Jennifer's) + 4 (Brandon's) = 7 puppies

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.35 \times 100 = 35\% \]

Therefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots."
"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to make, we first need to calculate the total weight of all the feed he is buying.

1. **Hay**: 42 bales at 75 pounds each
   \[
   42 \times 75 = 3150 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Oats**: 20 sacks at 65 pounds each
   \[
   20 \times 65 = 1300 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Carrots**: 4 bags at 12 pounds each
   \[
   4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Sugar cubes**: 2 boxes at 1 pound each
   \[
   2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Now, we add up all the weights:
\[
3150 + 1300 + 48 + 2 = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:
\[
\frac{4500}{2250} = 2
\]

Therefore, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."
"Grayson recycles 3 aluminum cans and 5 plastic bottles each week. 

For the aluminum cans:
3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week

For the plastic bottles:
5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week

Total earnings per week:
6 cents (from cans) + 15 cents (from bottles) = 21 cents/week

For a four-week month:
21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents

Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month."
"First, let's determine how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

\[ \text{Toni's plants} = \text{Frederick's plants} + 0.60 \times \text{Frederick's plants} \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 0.60 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 16 \]

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate the number of plants Shondra has as follows:

\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = \text{Toni's plants} - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 16 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 9 \]

Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants."

"To find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we first need to calculate the tip, which is 1/5 of the amount she ordered. Since the pizza costs $15, the tip would be:

\[ \text{Tip} = \frac{1}{5} \times 15 = 3 \]

Now, we add the tip to the cost of the pizza to get the total amount:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Cost of Pizza} + \text{Tip} = 15 + 3 = 18 \]

Therefore, the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man is $18."
"Let's break down Finley's position changes step by step:

1. She started in first place.
2. She fell back 5 spots: \(1 - 5 = -4\). Since she can't be in a negative spot, we adjust this to the last possible position, which is 100 (last place).
3. She then moved ahead 2 spots: \(100 + 2 = 98\).
4. She fell behind 3 spots: \(98 - 3 = 95\).
5. Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot: \(95 + 1 = 96\).

So, Finley finished in 96th place."
"First, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has:

\[ 6 \text{ decks} \times 25 \text{ cards/deck} = 150 \text{ basketball cards} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of baseball cards:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 40 \text{ cards/box} = 200 \text{ baseball cards} \]

Now, let's find the total number of cards she has:

\[ 150 \text{ basketball cards} + 200 \text{ baseball cards} = 350 \text{ cards} \]

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is:

\[ 350 \text{ cards} - 50 \text{ cards} = 300 \text{ cards} \]

If each student gets 10 cards, the number of students she has is:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ cards}}{10 \text{ cards/student}} = 30 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students."
"First, let's calculate how much Becky paid for her apples.

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.45 = 9.00 \text{ dollars} \]

After receiving a $1 discount, Becky's final cost is:
\[ 9.00 - 1.00 = 8.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for her apples.

Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Kelly received a 10 percent discount on her total cost. The discount amount is:
\[ 10.00 \times 0.10 = 1.00 \text{ dollar} \]

So, Kelly's final cost after the discount is:
\[ 10.00 - 1.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we subtract Becky's final cost from Kelly's final cost:

Therefore, Kelly paid $1.00 more than Becky."
"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we need to calculate the number of each type of laundry item per room and then multiply by the number of rooms.

1. Each room has 2 sheets.
2. Each room has 1 comforter.
3. Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases.
4. Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 towels.

Now, let's sum up the total number of laundry items per room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforters: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

Total laundry items per room = 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15

For 80 rooms, the total number of laundry items is:
15 items/room * 80 rooms = 1200 items

Final numerical answer:

"Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes. Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, he initially has 200 / 2 = 100 pairs.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs, so he now has 100 + 5 = 105 pairs.

On Wednesday, he gains 15 more pairs, making it 105 + 15 = 120 pairs.

On Friday, he gains another 30 pairs, so he has 120 + 30 = 150 pairs.

By Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. Since he has 150 pairs, he can only get rid of 150 pairs, not 180. So, he will have 0 pairs left after getting rid of all his shoes.

Therefore, on Sunday, he will have 0 pairs of shoes, which means he has 0 shoes.

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, so we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies. 

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet to match the unit of the shark's body length. There are 12 inches in a foot.

Each remora is 6 inches long, which is \( \frac{6}{12} = 0.5 \) feet long.

Since there are 2 remoras, the combined length of the remoras is \( 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \) foot.

The shark's body length is 10 feet.

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length."

"To find out how many kids in Gina's class are not allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to first determine how many kids are allergic to at least one of the substances (dairy or peanuts).

Let's denote:
- \(D\) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \(P\) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

We are given:
- \(|D| = 9\)
- \(|P| = 6\)
- \(|D \cap P| = 3\)
- Total number of kids in the class, \(|U| = 32\)

The number of kids allergic to at least one of the substances is given by:
\[|D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P|\]

Substituting the given values:
\[|D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12\]

This means 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances. To find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to at least one substance from the total number of kids in the class:
\[32 - 12 = 20\]

"To calculate the total cost of the trip, we need to consider the cost of the plane tickets and the cost of the hotel stay.

1. **Plane Tickets:**
   - Each plane ticket costs $5000.
   - Since there are two tickets, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
     \[
     5000 \times 2 = 10000
     \]

2. **Hotel Cost:**
   - The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day.
   - The hotel is 20% more expensive because it is a busy weekend.
   - The increased price per day is:
     \[
     1500 \times 0.20 = 300
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost per day during the busy weekend is:
     \[
     1500 + 300 = 1800
     \]
   - They are staying for 3 days, so the total hotel cost is:
     \[
     1800 \times 3 = 5400
     \]

3. **Total Cost of the Trip:**
   - Adding the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel stay:

Next, since he runs at a pace of 10 miles per hour, we can find the total hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles by his speed:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, James runs a total of 6 hours a week."
"To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the daily consumption of oats for one horse:**
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, the daily consumption for one horse is \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).

2. **Calculate the daily consumption of oats for all four horses:**
   - Since there are four horses, the total daily consumption is \(10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).

3. **Calculate the total consumption of oats for five days:**
   - The total consumption for five days is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).

4. **Determine the number of bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians.

Next, we need to find out how many of these Pomeranians are girls. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, so we calculate one third of 18:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
\]

Therefore, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

"To find the average highest temperature of these three countries, we need to add the highest temperatures together and then divide by the number of countries.

The highest temperatures are:
- Southlandia: -48°F
- Northlandia: 21°F
- Midlandia: -3°F

First, we add these temperatures together:
-48 + 21 + (-3) = -30°F

Next, we divide the sum by the number of countries, which is 3:
-30 / 3 = -10°F

The average highest temperature of these three countries is -10°F."
"To find out how many days it will take the child to save the remaining amount of money, we first need to calculate the remaining amount he needs to save.

The toy car costs $12, and the child already has $4 saved. So, the remaining amount he needs to save is:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

The child promises to save $2 daily from his allowance. To find out how many days it will take to save the remaining $8, we divide the remaining amount by the daily savings:

\[ 8 \div 2 = 4 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each tray can hold 24 eggs.
2. Jaime has 2 trays, so the total capacity of the trays is \(24 \times 2 = 48\) eggs.
3. Jaime has 64 eggs in total.

Now, to find out how many eggs won't be able to be placed on the tray, we subtract the total capacity of the trays from the total number of eggs:

\[64 - 48 = 16\]

So, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the tray."
"To find out how much Sally spends in all, we need to calculate the cost of the family-size pizza and then add it to the cost of the small pizza.

1. The cost of the small pizza is $8.
2. The family-size pizza costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, so:
   \[ \text{Cost of family-size pizza} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 + 24 = 32 \]

Sally spends a total of $32."
"To determine the cost per razor after the discount, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Cost of Razors:**
   - Razors come 4 to a pack.
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - Heather buys 2 packs.

2. **Total Cost Before Discounts:**
   - Cost of 2 packs = 2 * $4.00 = $8.00.

3. **Applying the ""Buy One Get One Free"" Sale:**
   - Since the sale is ""buy one get one free,"" Heather only pays for one pack and gets the second pack for free.
   - Cost after the sale = $4.00 (for the first pack).

4. **Applying the $2.00 Coupon:**
   - After applying the coupon, the cost = $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

5. **Total Number of Razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - Total number of razors = 2 packs * 4 razors/pack = 8 razors.

6. **Cost per Razor:**
   - Cost per razor = Total cost after discounts / Total number of razors.
   - Cost per razor = $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

7. **Convert to Cents:**
   - $0.25 = 25 cents.

**Final Answer:**

"To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to add the heights of the cheerleaders in the pyramid, with the shortest cheerleader at the top.

The pyramid structure is as follows:
- Bottom layer: 4 cheerleaders
- Middle layer: 3 cheerleaders
- Top layer: 2 cheerleaders
- Topmost layer: 1 cheerleader (the shortest one, who is 60"" tall)

Since 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64"" tall, the 10th (shortest) cheerleader is 60"" tall. We can assume the other cheerleaders in the pyramid are the 64"" tall ones, as the problem does not specify otherwise.

So, the total height of the pyramid is calculated as follows:

\[ 4 \times 64"" + 3 \times 64"" + 2 \times 64"" + 60"" \]

\[ = 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" \]

\[ = 636"" \]

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

\[ 636"" \div 12 = 53 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the human pyramid is 53 feet."
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour, and she works for 8 hours each day. Therefore, each day she walks:

\[ 5 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \]

After 5 days, the total time she has walked is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, after 5 days at the office, Charisma has walked 200 minutes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be \(14 + 4 = 18\) years old.
3. At that time, Angela will be three times Brett's current age. Brett's current age is 14, so three times that is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

This means that in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. To find out how old Angela is right now, we subtract 4 years from 42:

\[42 - 4 = 38\]

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

**Angela is 38 years old.**"
"Paul drives his car twice a day for 14 days. 

For the morning rides, he spends $6 each day, so for 14 days, he spends:
\[ 6 \times 14 = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

For the afternoon rides, he spends $2 each day, so for 14 days, he spends:
\[ 2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the costs of the morning and afternoon rides together, the total amount spent is:
\[ 84 + 28 = 112 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Paul spent a total of $112 on driving his car during these two weeks."
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, let's find the total number of oranges both brought together:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges, we can calculate the number of pies they can make by dividing the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, they can make 40 Greek orange pies."
"To find the number of guests at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests as \( x \).

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200 plus $5 per guest for food. So, the total cost for the first venue is:
\[ 200 + 5x \]

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per guest, and food is already included. So, the total cost for the second venue is:
\[ 25x \]

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( 10 \)."
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \(D\), by Lily as \(L\), and by Bodhi as \(B\).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \(L + D + B = 43\)
2. \(L = D + 7\)
3. \(D = \frac{1}{2}B\)

First, we can express \(B\) in terms of \(D\) using the third equation:
\[B = 2D\]

Now, we can substitute \(L\) and \(B\) in terms of \(D\) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]
\[ 4D = 36 \]
\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know \(D = 9\), we can find \(L\) and \(B\):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Lily found \(16\) insects.

Final numerical answer:
16"
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the amount of yarn each of them used and then add those amounts together.

First, let's calculate the amount of yarn Mariah used:
Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, Mariah used:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the amount of yarn Mariah's grandma used:
Her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein of yarn. So, she used:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we add the amounts of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma to find the total amount of yarn used:
\[ 91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, they used 273 yards of yarn altogether."

"Given that the chair is 3 feet wide, and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, we can determine the width of the rug as follows:

Width of the rug = Width of the chair + 5 feet
Width of the rug = 3 feet + 5 feet
Width of the rug = 8 feet

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. So, we can calculate the length of the couch as:

Length of the couch = 2 * Width of the rug + 2 feet
Length of the couch = 2 * 8 feet + 2 feet
Length of the couch = 16 feet + 2 feet
Length of the couch = 18 feet

Therefore, the couch is 18 feet long."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. Two of these packs are strawberry.
3. One pack is grape, which costs $2.
4. One pack is green apple, which costs half as much as the grape pack, so it costs $1.
5. The total cost of all the packs is $7.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

The total cost can be represented as:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

Each pack of strawberry gum costs $2."
"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, he should buy the cheapest lumber, which is the 2 x 4 piece of wood. Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks, and it costs $4.

Given that Frederick has $24 to spend, he can buy:

\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

pieces of 2 x 4 wood.

Since each piece of 2 x 4 wood provides 200 sticks, the total number of sticks he can make is:

"To determine the cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the price per pair of snowshoes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
- Each dog has 4 legs.
- Mario has 6 dogs.
- Total number of legs = 6 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 24 legs.

Step 2: Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
- Each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs.
- Number of pairs of snowshoes = 24 legs / 2 legs/pair = 12 pairs.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the price per pair of snowshoes.
- Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
- Total cost = 12 pairs * $12.00/pair = $144.00.

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $144.00."
"Janet takes two bus trips each day, and she does this five days a week. So, the total number of trips she makes in a week is:

2 trips/day * 5 days/week = 10 trips/week

If each bus trip costs her $2.20, then the total cost for her weekly bus trips without a pass would be:

10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $22.00/week

If she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, the cost for her bus trips would be $20.00.

To find out how much she would save by buying the weekly bus pass, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of the trips without the pass:

$22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00

So, Janet would save $2.00 by buying a weekly bus pass."
"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. 

The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, but the farm does not have any cows, so this statement is irrelevant to the farm's count.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, but the farm does not have any sheep, so this statement is also irrelevant to the farm's count.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo:

- The farm has 30 cows and 0 sheep, so the farm has a total of 30 animals.
- The zoo has 20 sheep and 0 cows, so the zoo has a total of 20 animals.

Adding the totals from both the farm and the zoo:

30 (farm's animals) + 20 (zoo's animals) = 50 animals

The farm and zoo have a combined total of 50 animals."

"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 pounds.
2. Determine the number of days Andy has to achieve this goal.
3. Calculate the daily calorie deficit required.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of calories to be burned.**

Andy wants to lose 30 pounds, and it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 pound. Therefore, the total number of calories to be burned is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Andy has to achieve this goal.**

Today is December 31st, and Andy's birthday is July 19th. The number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July (up to the 19th): 19 days

Adding these up:
\[ 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190 \text{ days} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the daily calorie deficit required.**

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total number of calories to be burned by the number of days:
\[ \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{190 \text{ days}} \approx 552.63 \text{ calories/day} \]

Therefore, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 553 calories to reach his goal."

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount spent on clothes.
2. Subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount to find the remaining money.
3. Calculate the amount spent on CDs from the remaining money.
4. Subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining money to find the final amount left.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Julie spent 20% of $500 on clothes.
   \[
   \text{Amount spent on clothes} = 20\% \times 500 = 0.20 \times 500 = 100
   \]

2. Subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount to find the remaining money.
   \[
   \text{Remaining money} = 500 - 100 = 400
   \]

3. Julie then spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.
   \[
   \text{Amount spent on CDs} = 25\% \times 400 = 0.25 \times 400 = 100
   \]

4. Subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining money to find the final amount left.
   \[
   \text{Final amount left} = 400 - 100 = 300
   \]

Therefore, Julie had $300 left."
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house:
\[ H = 3L \]
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

The house cost is $90,000."
"To calculate the profit Tara earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the canvas bags.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the bags.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the canvas bags.
Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, so she bought a total of \(8 \times 5 = 40\) canvas bags.
Each pack cost $4, so the total cost is \(40 \times 4 = \$160\).

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the bags.
Tara sold each bag for $8. Since she had 40 bags, the total revenue is \(40 \times 8 = \$320\).

Step 3: Calculate the profit.
Profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.
So, the profit is \(320 - 160 = \$160\).

Therefore, the profit Tara earned on her bags is \$160."

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially.

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. So, the total amount is calculated as follows:

\[ 4 \times 10 + 6 \times 20 = 40 + 120 = 160 \]

So, Ali has $160 in total.

Next, Ali gives half of this amount to his sister. Therefore, the amount given to his sister is:

\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \]

After giving $80 to his sister, Ali has:

\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \]

Now, Ali uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining $80 to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Tony's Picking Rate:**
   - Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

2. **Bobby's Picking Rate:**
   - Bobby picks one less quart than Tony.
   - Therefore, Bobby's rate is \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.

3. **Kathy's Picking Rate:**
   - Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby.
   - Therefore, Kathy's rate is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) quarts per hour.

4. **Ricky's Picking Rate:**
   - Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy.
   - Therefore, Ricky's rate is \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, we add up the rates of all four individuals to find the total number of quarts they can pick per hour:

- Tony: 6 quarts per hour
- Bobby: 5 quarts per hour
- Kathy: 10 quarts per hour
- Ricky: 8 quarts per hour

Total quarts per hour = \(6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29\)

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is 29."

"To determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Divide the total amount of raisins equally among the three uses (oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix):**
   \[
   \text{Raisins per use} = \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups per use}
   \]

2. **Calculate how many batches of oatmeal cookies can be made with 9 cups of raisins:**
   \[
   \text{Batches of oatmeal cookies} = \frac{9 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cup per batch}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \text{ batches}
   \]

Therefore, Heather can make \(\boxed{12}\) batches of oatmeal cookies."
"First, let's calculate Ada's current weekly electric consumption and cost.

Ada's current daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. There are 24 hours in a day, so her daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh) is:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} = 288 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

To find her weekly consumption, we multiply by 7 days:
\[ 288 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 2016 \, \text{kWh/week} \]

At a rate of $1.50 per kWh, her weekly bill is:
\[ 2016 \, \text{kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$3024 \, \text{per week} \]

Next, let's calculate her new weekly consumption after adding the device.

The new device consumes 2 kWh per hour. So, her new daily consumption is:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/hour} + 2 \, \text{kWh/hour} = 14 \, \text{kWh/hour} \]

Her new daily consumption in kWh is:
\[ 14 \, \text{kWh/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} = 336 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

Her new weekly consumption is:
\[ 336 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 2352 \, \text{kWh/week} \]

At the same rate of $1.50 per kWh, her new weekly bill is:
\[ 2352 \, \text{kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$3528 \, \text{per week} \]

Finally, the difference between her new and old weekly bills is:
\[ \$3528 - \$3024 = \$504 \]

So, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is:
\[ \$504 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the rate of one person:**
   - One person can paint half a house in 5 days.
   - Therefore, one person can paint a whole house in \(5 \times 2 = 10\) days.

2. **Determine the rate of 5 people:**
   - If one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, then 5 people working together can paint the same house in \(\frac{10}{5} = 2\) days.

3. **Convert days to hours:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - Therefore, 2 days is \(2 \times 24 = 48\) hours.

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

**Final answer:**
48 hours"
"Given that Ophelia has 20 sofas, and she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can calculate the number of chairs Ophelia has as follows:

Ophelia's chairs = Ophelia's sofas + 2
Ophelia's chairs = 20 + 2
Ophelia's chairs = 22

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so:

Jenna's chairs = 3 * Ophelia's chairs
Jenna's chairs = 3 * 22
Jenna's chairs = 66

Since Ophelia and Jenna have the same number of sofas as chairs (2 fewer than the number of chairs they have), we can calculate Jenna's sofas as follows:

Jenna's sofas = Jenna's chairs - 2
Jenna's sofas = 66 - 2
Jenna's sofas = 64

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:

Total sofas = Ophelia's sofas + Jenna's sofas
Total sofas = 20 + 64
Total sofas = 84

Total chairs = Ophelia's chairs + Jenna's chairs
Total chairs = 22 + 66
Total chairs = 88

Total number of sofas and chairs = Total sofas + Total chairs
Total number of sofas and chairs = 84 + 88
Total number of sofas and chairs = 172

"To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had not purchased the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of the headphone set.
2. Calculate how much money Tom would have left if he did not buy the headphone set.
3. Calculate how many CDs he could buy with the remaining money.

First, we know that Tom bought a CD for $4 and the total cost was $48. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of headphone set} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Cost of CD} = 48 - 4 = 44 \]

Next, if Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have the full $48 to spend on CDs. Since each CD costs $4, the number of CDs he could buy is:

\[ \text{Number of CDs} = \frac{\text{Total money available}}{\text{Cost of one CD}} = \frac{48}{4} = 12 \]

Since Tom originally bought 1 CD, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is:

\[ \text{Additional CDs} = 12 - 1 = 11 \]

Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set."
"To find the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours.

First, we know that for 6 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week. So, the total hours for these 6 weeks is:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ hours} \]

Next, he worked out for 5 hours each for 2 consecutive weeks. So, the total hours for these 2 weeks is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Additionally, he worked out for 6 hours in one week. So, the total hours for this week is:
\[ 1 \times 6 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add all these hours together to get the total number of hours spent working out over the 8 weeks:
\[ 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
40"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers becomes:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, 5 times that number is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
   So, 40 passengers get on the bus. The number of passengers now becomes:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
4. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers becomes:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
5. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, 3 times fewer means:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
   So, 7 passengers get on the bus. The number of passengers now becomes:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

Therefore, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is:
\[
66

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\).

2. **Determine Jame's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\).

3. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \(2 \times 30 = 60\).
   - Therefore, the cousin's age in 8 years will be \(60 - 5 = 55\).

4. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - If the cousin will be 55 in 8 years, then the cousin's current age is \(55 - 8 = 47\).

5. **Determine the age difference between Jame and his cousin now:**
   - Jame's current age is 22.
   - The cousin's current age is 47.
   - The age difference is \(47 - 22 = 25\).

The final numerical answer is:

"Given that the computer cost $1,100 and Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can determine the cost of the printer as follows:

Cost of the printer = Cost of the computer - $400
Cost of the printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of the printer = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, the printer, and the two monitors is $2,400. We can set up the equation to find the cost of the monitors:

Total cost = Cost of the computer + Cost of the printer + 2 * Cost of one monitor
$2,400 = $1,100 + $700 + 2 * Cost of one monitor

Simplifying the equation:

$2,400 = $1,800 + 2 * Cost of one monitor

Subtract $1,800 from both sides to isolate the term with the cost of the monitors:

$2,400 - $1,800 = 2 * Cost of one monitor
$600 = 2 * Cost of one monitor

Divide both sides by 2 to find the cost of one monitor:

Cost of one monitor = $600 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $300

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300."
"The boys brought back 60 shells each. According to the problem, the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. 

So, the number of seashells each girl brought is:

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old."
"The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 mm = 62 mm thick.

To find the total thickness of the four books, we add their individual thicknesses together:

31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma should make to complete her monthly goal, we first need to calculate how many vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

Adding these up: \(18 + 21 + 15 = 54\) vlogs.

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs per month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:

\(72 - 54 = 18\)

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total bill including the tip:**
   - The base bill is $50.
   - The tip is 20% of $50.
   - 20% of $50 is \( 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \).
   - Therefore, the total bill including the tip is \( 50 + 10 = 60 \).

2. **Split the total bill evenly:**
   - Since the bill is to be split evenly between two people, each person pays half of the total bill.
   - Half of $60 is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \).

So, you end up paying $30."
"First, let's determine how much each boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, each boy gets:

\[ \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The eldest boy then added $5 to his share, making it:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

The following day, he added another $10, so his total became:

\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

He then spent $8, leaving him with:

\[ 21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

After saving some more, he tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8. Let's denote the amount he saved as \( x \). Therefore, his new total is:

\[ 13 + x \]

According to the problem, this new total is triple the amount he had after spending $8, which is $13. So we have:

\[ 13 + x = 3 \times 13 \]
\[ 13 + x = 39 \]
\[ x = 39 - 13 \]
\[ x = 26 \]

Adding this to his remaining $13, the eldest boy now has:

\[ 13 + 26 = 39 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 39 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to break down the month of April into two halves and determine the daily savings for each half.

April has 30 days, so the first half consists of the first 15 days and the second half consists of the last 15 days.

Let's denote the daily savings in the first half as \( x \). Therefore, the total savings for the first half of April would be \( 15x \).

According to the problem, Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half. So, the daily savings in the second half would be \( 2x \). Therefore, the total savings for the second half of April would be \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. This means the sum of the savings from the first half and the second half should equal $1125. So, we can write the equation:

\[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 45:

\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of April. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he needs to save:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month."
"To find out how much change Verna received, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits she bought.

2. The cost of the oranges: \(5 \times \$0.80 = \$4.00\)
3. The cost of the peaches: \(6 \times \$0.75 = \$4.50\)

Now, we add up the costs of all the fruits:
\[
\$4.50 + \$4.00 + \$4.50 = \$13.00

So, Jairus's total earnings = $0.8 * 20 = $16.

Next, let's calculate Jenny's total earnings:
- Jenny gets $0.5 per task.
- She also completed 20 tasks.

So, Jenny's total earnings = $0.5 * 20 = $10.

Now, to find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's total earnings from Jairus's total earnings:
- Difference = Jairus's total earnings - Jenny's total earnings
- Difference = $16 - $10 = $6.

Therefore, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny."
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

- 3 cages have 10 hamsters each, so that's 3 * 10 = 30 hamsters.
- The other 3 cages have 5 guinea pigs each, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 guinea pigs.

Adding the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together gives the total number of rodents:

30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents.

The pet shop had a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's determine the weight of each person:

1. Mark weighs 150 pounds.
2. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan's weight is \(150 - 20 = 130\) pounds.
3. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob's weight is \(130 \times 2 = 260\) pounds.

Now, to find the average weight of the three friends, we add their weights together and divide by 3:

\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{\text{Mark's weight} + \text{Susan's weight} + \text{Bob's weight}}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{150 + 130 + 260}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{540}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average weight} = 180 \]

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the initial angle of the pyramid and the movement of the sun over time.

1. The initial angle of the pyramid from the ground is 32 degrees.
2. The sun moves 5 degrees per hour straight upward.
3. The sun moves for 10 hours.

The total movement of the sun in 10 hours is:
\[ 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \]

Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground, and moves 50 degrees straight upward, the new angle from the ground to the sun will be:
\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ 82 \text{ degrees} \]"
"First, let's determine the ages of James's sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, so the second son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of candles required. Since each son needs a candle for each year of their age, we add the ages of both sons: 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Now, we need to find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Each pack contains 5 candles, so we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: 20 / 5 = 4 packs.

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pack costs $3, so we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 4 * $3 = $12.

James spends $12 on candles."
"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the total reading time for the first week and then add the reading from the second week.

First, let's calculate the reading time for the first week:
- Judy read for 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.

So, the total reading time for the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the reading time from minutes to pages using the given reading speed:
- Judy can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes.

To find out how many pages she can read in 1 minute, we divide 2 pages by 1.5 minutes:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages she read in the first week:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

So, the total number of pages she read in two weeks is:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

Therefore, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
240"
"Cody ate a third of the 12 sandwiches, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) sandwiches.

Trevor ate a quarter of the 12 sandwiches, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \) sandwiches.

Together, they ate \( 4 + 3 = 7 \) sandwiches.

Therefore, the number of sandwiches left is \( 12 - 7 = 5 \).

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so \( S = 44 \).
2. In 7 years, Shiloh will be \( S + 7 \) years old.
3. In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, in 7 years, his nephew will be \( N + 7 \) years old.

We can set up the equation based on the information given:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substituting \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Now, we solve for \( N \):
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left Sharon $1.00 for each tooth. So, for three teeth, that's $1.00 × 3 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of money per tooth as for the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth each earned $1.00, half of that is $0.50. So, for two teeth, that's $0.50 × 2 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all the amounts:

- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

Total amount = $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00

The tooth fairy left Sharon a total of $9.00."
"Given that Richie scored 80 goals, and he scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can determine the number of goals Mark scored as follows:

\[ \text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Similarly, since Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, we can determine the number of goals Anna scored as follows:

\[ \text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:

\[ \text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} \]
\[ \text{Total goals} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

Therefore, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is 175."
"To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we first need to calculate how much money each of them made.

Liam made $63.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each, so he made:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:
\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

Mitchell made 21 more dollars than Liam that weekend."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per week.
2. Determine the number of weeks in a month (assuming an average month has about 4 weeks).
3. Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.
4. Compare the total number of roses Ford grows in a month with the total number of roses he needs to supply to the flower shops in a month to find the deficit.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per week.
- First flower shop: 20 roses
- Second flower shop: 15 roses
- Third flower shop: 30 roses

Total roses supplied per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Step 2: Determine the number of weeks in a month.
- We assume an average month has 4 weeks.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.
- Ford grows 40 roses every week.
- In a month (4 weeks), Ford grows: 40 roses/week * 4 weeks = 160 roses

Step 4: Calculate the total number of roses Ford needs to supply to the flower shops in a month.
- Ford supplies 65 roses per week.
- In a month (4 weeks), Ford needs to supply: 65 roses/week * 4 weeks = 260 roses

Step 5: Determine the deficit.
- Ford grows 160 roses in a month.
- Ford needs to supply 260 roses in a month.
- The deficit is: 260 roses - 160 roses = 100 roses

Therefore, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."

"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total revenue and the total cost, and then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.
   - Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Cost of bread: Each loaf costs $3.00 and makes 10 sandwiches.
     - Cost of bread for 10 sandwiches = $3.00
   - Cost of cheeses and condiments: $30.00 for 10 sandwiches.
     - Cost of cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches = $30.00
   - Total cost for 10 sandwiches = Cost of bread + Cost of cheeses and condiments
     - Total cost for 10 sandwiches = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct setting for a 520-degree recipe.

First, let's calculate the percentage error in the temperature setting:

\[ \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Temperature} - \text{Set Temperature}}{\text{Set Temperature}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 0.04 \times 100 = 4\% \]

So, the oven is 4% too hot.

Now, we need to find the correct setting for a 520-degree recipe. If the oven is 4% too hot, we need to set it to a temperature that, when 4% is added, equals 520 degrees. Let's denote the correct setting as \( x \).

\[ x + 0.04x = 520 \]
\[ 1.04x = 520 \]
\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]
\[ x = 500 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees if her recipe calls for 520 degrees."
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, the first movie is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours into minutes gives:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]
Adding the 5 minutes gives:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 125 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the durations of the two movies together:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 125 \text{ minutes} = 215 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate 30% of the price of Herb's house and then subtract that from the price of Herb's house.

Herb's house price: $76,000

30% of $76,000 = 0.30 * $76,000 = $22,800

Now, we subtract this amount from the price of Herb's house to find the price of Juan's house:

Juan's house price: $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

To find the combined value of the two houses, we add the price of Juan's house to the price of Herb's house:

Combined value = $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy brought, which means her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups brought by both Judy and her friend is 12 + 40 = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes brought by both is 24 + 44 = 68 dishes.

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two is 52 + 68 = 120.

"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount. 

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per contact when buying 2 boxes is $1.00. However, the question asks for the cost per pair of contacts. Since the number of contacts per box is 90, and we are buying 2 boxes, we have 180 contacts. The number of pairs in 180 contacts is:
\[ \frac{180}{2} = 90 \text{ pairs} \]

The cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \]

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \boxed{2.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours worked by Jill and John.

Jill worked:

- Three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday
Total hours for John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours

Now, let's calculate the earnings for each.

Jill's earnings:
- $10 per hour * 3 hours = $30

John's earnings:
- $10 per hour * 7 hours = $70

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:
- John's earnings - Jill's earnings = $70 - $30 = $40

John earned $40 more than Jill.

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate the total calories Hannah burns from aerobics and running.

- Aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
- Running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Now, according to the given ratio, Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. So, we can calculate the total amount of water she needs to drink as follows:

Total water needed = (Total calories burned / 200 calories) * 100 ml
Total water needed = (1600 calories / 200 calories) * 100 ml
Total water needed = 8 * 100 ml
Total water needed = 800 ml

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the note on the jar, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. We can express the number of red and green jelly beans in terms of \( B \):

- Number of red jelly beans = \( B - 0.01B = 0.99B \)
- Number of green jelly beans = \( B + 0.01B = 1.01B \)

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

- Number of red jelly beans = \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Number of green jelly beans = \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:

\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."

- Cost of boots: $16
- Shipping cost: $4
- Total cost on Amazon: $16 + $4 = $20

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the boots on eBay:
- Cost of boots: $13
- Shipping cost: Twice the cost of Amazon's shipping, so $4 * 2 = $8
- Total cost on eBay: $13 + $8 = $21

Now, we find the difference in total cost between eBay and Amazon:
- Total cost on eBay: $21
- Total cost on Amazon: $20
- Difference: $21 - $20 = $1

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to grow taller than 20 feet, given that it doubles its height every day and starts at 4 feet tall.

Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk each day until it exceeds 20 feet:

- Day 0: 4 feet
- Day 1: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
- Day 2: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
- Day 3: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

On Day 3, the beanstalk reaches 32 feet, which is taller than the 20 feet required to be taller than Mark's window.

Therefore, it takes 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the weekly protein intake based on daily consumption.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, 200 grams (which is double the amount) would contain double the protein:

\[ 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} \times \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

So, John gets 6 grams of protein from 200 grams of mushrooms each day.

Next, to find out how much protein he gets in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ 6 \text{ grams of protein/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein/week} \]

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms daily."
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
Subtract \( 2J \) from both sides:
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
Multiply both sides by -1:
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

1. The base price for 2 implants is $2000 each, so for 2 implants, the cost is:
   \[2 \times \$2000 = \$4000\]

2. For one of the implants, there is an additional cost for a porcelain crown, which is $500. So, the total cost for the dental work is:
   \[ \$4000 + \$500 = \$4500\]

3. George has already put down a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
   \[ \$4500 - \$600 = \$3900\]

4. George makes $15 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
   \[\frac{\$3900}{\$15 \text{ per hour}} = 260 \text{ hours}\]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

Dividing both sides by 6, we find:

\[ x = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 90 \) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees."
"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has in nickels. Each gumball costs a nickel, so we need to find out how many nickels he can get from his other coins.

First, let's convert all his coins into nickels:
- 8 quarters are worth \(8 \times 5 = 40\) nickels.
- 6 dimes are worth \(6 \times 2 = 12\) nickels.
- 14 nickels are worth \(14 \times 1 = 14\) nickels.
- 15 pennies are worth \(15 \div 5 = 3\) nickels.

Now, we add up all the nickels:
\[40 + 12 + 14 + 3 = 69\]

Since each gumball costs 1 nickel, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

Final numerical answer:
69"
"To determine the total number of legs the pets in the store have, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

- Dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- Cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- Birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:

\(20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}\)

Therefore, the total number of legs the pets in the store have is 48."
"Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He increases the weight by 50%, so the new weight is:

\[ 8 \text{ pounds} + (0.50 \times 8 \text{ pounds}) = 8 \text{ pounds} + 4 \text{ pounds} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, he uses a weight that is two pounds lighter than this, so the final weight he uses is:

\[ 12 \text{ pounds} - 2 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

The weight that he now uses is 10 pounds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Games**: Steve gets 5 games for his birthday.
2. **First Year**: He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so he gets \(1 \times 12 = 12\) games.
3. **Second Year**: He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so he gets \(2 \times 12 = 24\) games.
4. **Third Year**: He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, so he gets \(4 \times 12 = 48\) games.
5. **Christmas Gifts**: He gets 5 games every year for 3 years, so he gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) games.

Now, let's add all these up:

- Initial games: 5
- First year: 12
- Second year: 24
- Third year: 48
- Christmas gifts: 15

Total number of games = \(5 + 12 + 24 + 48 + 15 = 104\)

So, after 3 years, Steve has 104 games."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The speed can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Given that the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, the speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same speed. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate.

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolate Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds of chocolate Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds as Ruiz in an hour:

\[ 60 \times \frac{3}{4} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we find out how many pounds of chocolate Ruiz and Marissa can make together in one hour:

\[ 60 + 45 = 105 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Since they worked for 12 hours in a day, we multiply the total amount they can make in one hour by 12:

\[ 105 \times 12 = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together in 12 hours is:

\[ 1260 \text{ pounds} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Howard spends each day and then subtract the total from his original amount of $100.

1. On Monday, Howard spends $8.
2. On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
3. On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as on Tuesday, which is \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, let's add up the total amount spent over the three days:
\[8 + 16 + 64 = 88\]

Howard originally had $100. After spending $88, the amount of money he has left is:
\[100 - 88 = 12\]

Therefore, Howard has $12 left."
"To calculate the total money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours, we need to break down the problem into two parts based on the different rates of sales and prices.

First, for the first four hours:
- He sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Therefore, the earnings for the first four hours are \(15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/cup} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ dollars}\).

Next, for the next two hours:
- He sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Therefore, the earnings for the next two hours are \(10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 0.60 \text{ dollars/cup} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ dollars}\).

Adding the earnings from both periods:
- Total earnings = \(30 \text{ dollars} + 12 \text{ dollars} = 42 \text{ dollars}\).

So, the total money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours is:
42 dollars."
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations per tire for Jeremy's monthly driving.
2. Determine the total number of rotations per tire over a year.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations per tire for Jeremy's monthly driving.**

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
\[ \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/rotation cycle}} \times 725 \text{ rotations/cycle} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of rotations per tire over a year.**

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of rotations per tire in a year is:
\[ 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.**

To find out how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations, we divide the total number of rotations by the number of rotations per year:
\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the tire will need to be replaced in \(\boxed{6}\) years."
"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of washings per pump.
2. Determine the cost per washing.
3. Calculate the cost per pump.

First, we know that 2 pumps of shampoo give 120 washings. Therefore, 1 pump would give half of that number of washings:

\[ \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per washing. The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, which is equivalent to 2400 cents (since 1 dollar = 100 cents):

\[ \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{2400 \text{ cents}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 20 \text{ cents per washing} \]

Now, since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost per pump is:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = 60 \text{ washings} \times 20 \text{ cents per washing} = 1200 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost per pump is:

\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"First, let's calculate the discount on the items Joe is purchasing.

The shirt originally costs $25, and there is a 30% discount on it. The discount amount for the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

So, the discounted price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

Next, the shorts cost $35, and there is no discount mentioned for the shorts. So, the price of the shorts remains $35.

Now, let's add the discounted price of the shirt and the price of the shorts to find the total cost of the items:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

However, Joe only has $50 to spend. Since the total cost of the items ($52.50) is more than the amount Joe has, he cannot afford to buy both items. Therefore, the question as stated does not have a feasible solution under the given constraints.

But if we were to assume the question meant to ask how much money Joe would have left if he could only buy one item, we would calculate as follows:

If Joe buys the shirt:
\[ 50 - 17.50 = 32.50 \]

If Joe buys the shorts:
\[ 50 - 35 = 15 \]

Since Joe cannot afford both items, the maximum amount of money Joe can have left after the purchase is $32.50 if he buys the shirt.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{32.50} \]"
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan plans to make in a week.
2. Determine the amount of butter needed for the total number of dozens of croissants.

First, Juan plans to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days. So, the total number of dozens of croissants he will make in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we know that it takes \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, for 28 dozen croissants, the amount of butter needed is:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make these croissants."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we first need to calculate the cost of repaving each street.

The cost to repave Monica's street:
\[ \text{Cost} = 150 \, \text{meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$29,100 \]

The cost to repave Lewis' street:
\[ \text{Cost} = 490 \, \text{meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$95,060 \]

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street:
\[ \text{Difference} = \$95,060 - \$29,100 = \$65,960 \]

Therefore, it costs \(\$65,960\) more to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street."
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining 5 months.

1. **Cost for the first 5 months:**
   - Initial funding: $100,000

2. **Cost for the remaining 5 months:**
   - The research took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so the remaining period is \(10 - 5 = 5\) months.
   - Each of these months cost 50% more than the previous month's cost.
   - The cost for the 6th month is \(100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000\).
   - The cost for the 7th month is \(150,000 \times 1.5 = 225,000\).
   - The cost for the 8th month is \(225,000 \times 1.5 = 337,500\).
   - The cost for the 9th month is \(337,500 \times 1.5 = 506,250\).
   - The cost for the 10th month is \(506,250 \times 1.5 = 759,375\).

Now, we sum up the costs for the remaining 5 months:
\[150,000 + 225,000 + 337,500 + 506,250 + 759,375 = 1,978,125\]

Finally, we add the cost of the first 5 months to the cost of the remaining 5 months:
\[100,000 + 1,978,125 = 2,078,125\]

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is:
\[2,078,125\]"
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to add up the ounces of meat each player ate.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that's 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, this is 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these together:

6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."

March typically has 31 days.

Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day.

So, the total number of posts per member in March is:
3 posts/day * 31 days = 93 posts/member

Since there are 1000 members in the group, the total number of posts for the group in March is:
93 posts/member * 1000 members = 93,000 posts

Therefore, the total number of posts that the group will have in March is:
93,000"
"Gary does laundry twice a week, so in a year (52 weeks), he does laundry 52 * 2 = 104 times.

Each load uses 20 gallons of water, so for 104 loads, he uses 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons of water.

A gallon of water costs $0.15, so for 2080 gallons, he spends 2080 * $0.15 = $312.

Therefore, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year."
"To find out how much Scarlett spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each item she bought and then sum these costs.

1. Aquarium: $10.00
2. Rocks: 2 bags at $2.50 each = 2 * $2.50 = $5.00
3. Coral: 3 pieces at $2.00 each = 3 * $2.00 = $6.00
4. Fish: 20 fish at $0.50 each = 20 * $0.50 = $10.00
5. Fish food: $2.00

Therefore, after 3 weeks, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall."
"To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of meat from the bull.
2. Determine how much meat Prince sells in one day.
3. Calculate the number of days required to sell all the meat.

First, the total amount of meat from the bull is 750kg.

Next, Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day. Therefore, the amount of meat he sells in one day is:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Now, to find out how many days it will take Prince to sell 750kg of meat, we divide the total amount of meat by the amount he sells per day:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"To find the number of students in the school auditorium, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium.
2. Determine the number of seats occupied by the administrators.
3. Calculate the number of remaining seats after the administrators have taken their seats.
4. Determine the number of seats occupied by the parents.
5. Calculate the number of seats occupied by the students.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The total number of seats in the auditorium is \(4 \text{ rows} \times 18 \text{ seats per row} = 72 \text{ seats}\).

2. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, so the number of seats occupied by the administrators is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \text{ seats}\).

3. The number of remaining seats after the administrators have taken their seats is \(72 - 18 = 54 \text{ seats}\).

4. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents, so the number of seats occupied by the parents is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \text{ seats}\).

5. The number of seats occupied by the students is the remaining seats after the administrators and parents have taken their seats, which is \(54 - 18 = 36 \text{ seats}\).

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is \(\boxed{36}\)."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Pack of Gum**: Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.

2. **Gum Chewing at School**: He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, after school, he has:
   \[
   20 - 4 = 16 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Gum Chewing on the Way Home and After Dinner**: He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so he chews:
   \[
   1 + 1 = 2 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   After these, he has:
   \[
   16 - 2 = 14 \text{ pieces}
   \]

4. **Giving Half to His Sister**: He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives:

- Total cost for basketballs: 8 * $14 = $112

Now, to find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we subtract the total cost of the baseballs from the total cost of the basketballs:
- Difference in cost: $112 - $27 = $85

The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To find out how many flowers have bloomed, we first need to calculate the total number of flowers planted in Arianna's garden. 

Arianna has 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row. So, the total number of flowers is:
\[ 10 \text{ rows} \times 20 \text{ flowers/row} = 200 \text{ flowers} \]

Now, we know that only \( \frac{4}{5} \) of the planted flowers have bloomed. To find the number of bloomed flowers, we multiply the total number of flowers by \( \frac{4}{5} \):
\[ 200 \times \frac{4}{5} = 160 \]

So, the number of flowers that have bloomed in Arianna's garden is:
\[ 160 \]"
"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to convert the speed from kb per second to Mb per hour.

1. First, convert kb per second to Mb per second:
   - 1 Mb = 1000 kb
   - Ashley's speed is 20 kb/s
   - So, in Mb/s, her speed is \( \frac{20}{1000} = 0.02 \) Mb/s

2. Next, convert Mb per second to Mb per hour:
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are \( 60 \times 60 = 3600 \) seconds in an hour.
   - Therefore, her speed in Mb per hour is \( 0.02 \times 3600 = 72 \) Mb/h

Ashley’s internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"To calculate the total number of cars towed in the week, we can break down the problem as follows:

- For the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. So, for three days, the total is \(10 \times 3 = 30\) cars.
- For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars than the first three days, which means it pulled \(10 - 4 = 6\) cars each day. So, for four days, the total is \(6 \times 4 = 24\) cars.

Adding these together, the total number of cars towed in the week is \(30 + 24 = 54\).

Therefore, the total number of cars towed that week is 54."
"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.

First, let's convert Adam's current height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide Adam's height by 12:

\[ \text{Adam's current height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how much taller Adam needs to be to meet the 4 feet requirement:

\[ \text{Height difference} = 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:

\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, we can calculate the number of years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference:

\[ \text{Years required} = \frac{\frac{2}{3} \text{ feet}}{\frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year}} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.
2. Determine the total cost to the company for acquiring the cars.
3. Calculate the profit.
4. Calculate James's commission on the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.**

James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the total cost to the company for acquiring the cars.**

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
\[ \text{Cost per car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit.**

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

**Step 4: Calculate James's commission on the profit.**

James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
\[ \text{Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

Therefore, James made \(\boxed{17500}\)."
"First, we need to determine how many of the 100 riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate:

\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \]

So, 25 riders can stay upright.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are men. We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, which means 40% are men. Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is:

\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can calculate the price of a gold jewel as follows:

Price of a gold jewel = \(\frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600\)

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel, so:

Price of a silver jewel = \(1600 - 400 = 1200\)

Now, to find the total price for all three jewels, we add the prices together:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = \(2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800\)

The total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and then sum them up.

1. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so the number of truck stamps is \(16 + 3 = 19\).
3. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so the number of rose stamps is \(19 - 9 = 10\).

Now, we add up all the stamps:
\[16 \text{ (snowflake)} + 19 \text{ (truck)} + 10 \text{ (rose)} = 45\]

Therefore, Max bought a total of 45 stamps."
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob. 

Bob is driving at 55 mph, and Tom is driving at 70 mph. The difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, we can find the time it takes for Tom to catch up by dividing the distance by the relative speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to follow the information given step by step.

1. Naomi caught 17 fish.
2. Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, so Darren caught \(17 - 6 = 11\) fish.
3. Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so Tommy caught \(11 + 3 = 14\) fish.

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we first need to calculate the maximum total cost that would still allow the cost per class to be $10 or less.

Given:
- Total cost for 10 classes = $60
- Cost per class if 10 classes are attended = $60 / 10 = $6
- Maximum cost per class allowed = $10

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as \( x \). If he misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class in this scenario would be \( \frac{60}{10 - x} \).

We need to find the maximum \( x \) such that the cost per class does not exceed $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10. 

Final numerical answer:
Manny can miss 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of customers each person processes in a week and then sum these numbers.

1. **Determine the number of customers Jewel processes in a week:**
   - Jewel processes 50 customers per day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, Jewel processes \(50 \times 7 = 350\) customers per week.

2. **Determine the number of customers Julie processes in a week:**
   - Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel.
   - Therefore, Julie processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers per day.
   - Over 7 days, Julie processes \(100 \times 7 = 700\) customers per week.

3. **Calculate the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel:**
   - Total weekly production = Jewel's weekly production + Julie's weekly production
   - Total weekly production = \(350 + 700 = 1050\)

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles."
"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

1. **Cost of one apple:**
   - Four apples cost $5.20.
   - Therefore, the cost of one apple is \( \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of one orange:**
   - Three oranges cost $3.30.
   - Therefore, the cost of one orange is \( \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost for 5 apples:**
   - Since one apple costs $1.30, five apples will cost \( 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \) dollars.

4. **Total cost for 5 oranges:**
   - Since one orange costs $1.10, five oranges will cost \( 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \) dollars.

5. **Total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:**
   - Adding the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we get \( 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \) dollars.

Therefore, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) it will take him to dig the hole is:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price of the truck to the cost of each of the additional features.

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so \( \frac{1}{3} \times 7500 = 2500 \) dollars
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so \( 2500 - 500 = 2000 \) dollars
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1500

Now, we add all these costs together:

\[ 30000 + 7500 + 2500 + 2000 + 1500 = 43500 \]

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"First, let's calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise:

\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \text{Original Monthly Salary} + (\text{Original Monthly Salary} \times \text{Raise Percentage}) \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$20,000 + (\$20,000 \times 0.05) \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$20,000 + \$1,000 \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$21,000 \]

Next, we add the bonus, which is half a month's salary:

\[ \text{Bonus} = \frac{\text{New Monthly Salary}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Bonus} = \frac{\$21,000}{2} \]
\[ \text{Bonus} = \$10,500 \]

Now, we calculate Tim's total monthly earnings including the bonus:

\[ \text{Total Monthly Earnings} = \text{New Monthly Salary} + \text{Bonus} \]
\[ \text{Total Monthly Earnings} = \$21,000 + \$10,500 \]
\[ \text{Total Monthly Earnings} = \$31,500 \]

Finally, to find out how much money Tim will make in a year, we multiply his total monthly earnings by 12:

\[ \text{Annual Earnings} = \text{Total Monthly Earnings} \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Annual Earnings} = \$31,500 \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Annual Earnings} = \$378,000 \]

Therefore, Tim will make $378,000 in a year."

"To find the total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then sum these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Alisa biked:
- Alisa's speed: 12 miles per hour
- Alisa's time: 4.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Alisa biked = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Stanley biked:
- Stanley's speed: 10 miles per hour
- Stanley's time: 2.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Stanley biked = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances biked by Alisa and Stanley to find the total distance:

"To calculate the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to determine the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add these times together.

First, let's calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He has to dig 24 feet of soil.
- Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.

Next, let's calculate the time to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs half as fast through clay, which is 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour.
- He has to dig 8 feet of clay.
- Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

Therefore, the total number of Instagram likes is 162000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost Clara paid for her pomegranates on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the voucher was:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She got a $2 discount, so the final amount she paid was:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost Sheila paid for her pomegranates on Wednesday.

The price per pomegranate on Wednesday was $30, so the total cost before the discount was:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

Sheila got a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount was:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final amount Sheila paid was:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \text{ dollars} \]

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:

"James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he is charged for 3 hours.

The first paid hour costs $15. Each hour after that is twice the cost, so the second hour costs $15 * 2 = $30, and the third hour costs $30 * 2 = $60.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of each hour:
$15 (first hour) + $30 (second hour) + $60 (third hour) = $105.

Therefore, James paid $105."
"Sally's bank account increased from $200 to $420 during the week. This means she received an additional $220 in the week. Since her weekly wage should be $300, and she received $220, the difference between her expected wage and the amount she received is the amount that was withheld.

To find the amount withheld, we subtract the amount received from her expected wage:

$300 (expected wage) - $220 (received) = $80

The amount withheld from Sally’s wage is $80."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed.

"To calculate the total cost for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane, the monthly hanger rental cost, and the monthly fuel cost.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane**: $150,000
2. **Monthly Hanger Rental Cost**: $5,000
3. **Monthly Fuel Cost**: Twice the hanger rental cost, which is $5,000 * 2 = $10,000

Now, let's calculate the total monthly cost for maintaining the plane:
\[ \text{Total Monthly Cost} = \text{Hanger Rental Cost} + \text{Fuel Cost} = \$5,000 + \$10,000 = \$15,000 \]

To find the total cost for the first year, we multiply the total monthly cost by 12 (months in a year):
\[ \text{Total Yearly Cost} = \text{Total Monthly Cost} \times 12 = \$15,000 \times 12 = \$180,000 \]

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the yearly maintenance cost:
\[ \text{Total Cost for the First Year} = \text{Initial Cost} + \text{Total Yearly Cost} = \$150,000 + \$180,000 = \$330,000 \]

So, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is:

"Given that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, we can use this information to find out the cooking times for the other ingredients.

1. **Cooking time for rice (R):** 30 minutes
2. **Cooking time for pork (P):** It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so:
   \[ P = R + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]
3. **Cooking time for beans (B):** Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, so:
   \[ B = \frac{1}{2} (P + R) = \frac{1}{2} (50 + 30) = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the total cooking time for all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans:
\[ \text{Total cooking time} = R + P + B = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

**Final answer:**
120"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):

- Cost of 1/2 pound almonds: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars
- Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars
- Total cost of the first mixture: \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):

- Cost of 1/5 pound almonds: \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars
- Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars
- Total cost of the second mixture: \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:

- Difference in cost: \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars

Therefore, the first mixture costs $3 more than the second mixture."
"Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, and geese have 2 legs and 1 head. We can set up the following equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20:
\[ S + G = 20 \]

2. The total number of legs is 70:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
\[ S + G = 20 \]
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

To solve for \( S \) and \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The original brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

To find 20% of $5, we calculate:
\[ 5 \times 0.20 = 1 \]

So, the more expensive brand costs:
\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, which is 7 pounds (since he uses 1 pound per day). Therefore, the cost of the coffee for a week is:
\[ 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

He also buys a donut for $2. 

Adding the cost of the coffee and the donut together, we get:
\[ 42 + 2 = 44 \]

Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 44 \text{ dollars} \]"
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the cost of the other items Gus bought from the total amount he spent.

1. Cost of 2 bags of chips: \(2 \times \$2.00 = \$4.00\)
2. Cost of the bucket of fried chicken: \$8.00
3. Cost of the bottle of soda: \$1.00

Total cost of these items: \(\$4.00 + \$8.00 + \$1.00 = \$13.00\)

Gus spent a total of \$20.00, so the cost of the apple pie is:

\(\$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00\)

The apple pie cost \$7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

Total newspapers delivered in a day = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers - (Newspapers to District A + Newspapers to District C)

Let's calculate:

Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - (198 + 209)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 407
Newspapers delivered to District B = 193

James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."
"To determine how many recipes John learns, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours John spends in the class.
2. Determine how many recipes he learns based on the total hours of class time.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours John spends in the class:

- The class meets 4 times a week.
- Each session is 2 hours long.
- The class runs for 6 weeks.

So, the total number of hours is:
\[ 4 \text{ sessions/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/session} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how many recipes he learns. He learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. Therefore, we divide the total hours by 1.5:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ hours}}{1.5 \text{ hours/recipe}} = 32 \text{ recipes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 32 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of history teachers on the basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

So, there are 90 history teachers. Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

Therefore, there are 60 math teachers. Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, so the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

The total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours."
"First, let's determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's amount as follows:

\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, we know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's amount as follows:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, we can find the total amount of money they have together by adding their individual amounts:

\[ \text{Total money} = \text{Aurelia's money} + \text{Kassidy's money} + \text{Rayna's money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \]

If they decide to share the money equally among the three of them, each person would get:

\[ \text{Each person's share} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{3} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \]

So, if they decide to add together their money and share equally among them, each would have \(\boxed{120}\) dollars."
"The game originally consists of 4 quarters, each 12 minutes long. So, the total time for the 4 quarters is:

4 quarters * 12 minutes/quarter = 48 minutes

Since there was a tie in the last quarter and the game was extended for an additional 5 minutes, we add this to the original time:

48 minutes + 5 minutes = 53 minutes

The entire game lasted 53 minutes."
"First, let's calculate the number of employees who are in management. Since 20% of the 50 employees are management, we calculate:

\[ 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 management employees.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 10 management employees oversee the entire company. Since 30% of the management employees oversee the company, we calculate:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of employees who oversee the company is 3."
"To calculate the total tablespoons of dry ingredients Svetlana would need for 16 muffins, we first need to determine the total amount of flour, sugar, and salt required for one muffin, and then multiply by 16.

For one muffin:
- Flour: 5 tablespoons
- Sugar: 3 tablespoons
- Salt: 0.25 tablespoon

Total dry ingredients for one muffin = 5 + 3 + 0.25 = 8.25 tablespoons

For 16 muffins:
Total dry ingredients = 8.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 132 tablespoons

Therefore, Svetlana would need 132 tablespoons of dry ingredients to make 16 muffins."
"To find out how much candy each person would have if they shared equally, we first need to calculate the total amount of candy they have together.

Robert has 3 pounds, Cindy has 5 pounds, and Aaron has 4 pounds. So, the total amount of candy is:

\[ 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to divide this total equally among the three of them:

\[ \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, if they share the candy equally, each of them would have:

\[ \boxed{4 \text{ pounds}} \]"
"To find out how much change Adam got, we first need to calculate the total cost of the candies he bought.

The cost of 7 candies of type A, each costing $0.5, is:
\[ 7 \times 0.5 = 3.5 \]

The cost of 10 candies of type B, each costing $0.75, is:
\[ 10 \times 0.75 = 7.5 \]

Adding these two amounts gives the total cost of the candies:
\[ 3.5 + 7.5 = 11.0 \]

Adam paid $15, so the change he received is:
\[ 15 - 11 = 4.0 \]

Therefore, the change Adam got is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Christina had a total of 30 days of mood records. Out of these, 12 were good, 8 were bad, and the rest were neutral. Since her first 8 days were good, her next 8 days were bad, and the following 8 days were neutral, we can calculate the number of neutral days as follows:

Total days - Good days - Bad days = Neutral days
30 - 12 - 8 = 10 neutral days

Now, adding the next 3 days (good, neutral, and good) to the count of good days:
12 (initial good days) + 2 (additional good days) = 14 good days

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 14.

To find the number of books Sally has, we need to solve for \( S \):
\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches.
2. Calculate the total height increase needed for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.
3. Determine how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow the required additional height, given its daily growth rate.

Step 1: Convert the current height from feet to inches.
- 1 foot = 12 inches
- Current height = 20 feet = 20 * 12 inches = 240 inches

Step 2: Calculate the total height increase needed.
- Target height = 600 inches
- Current height = 240 inches
- Height increase needed = 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Step 3: Determine the number of days required.
- Daily growth rate = 30 inches/day
- Number of days required = Height increase needed / Daily growth rate = 360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to a height of 600 inches.

12 days"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are 8 more dogs, so now there are 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
3. James buys toys for these 12 dogs, so he now has 12 toys.
4. When he returns, there are twice as many dogs as before, so there are 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.
5. To accommodate these 24 dogs, James needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys.
6. After buying these toys, there are 12 + 12 = 24 toys in total.
7. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so he no longer needs toys for those 3 dogs. Therefore, he needs to subtract 3 toys from his total, leaving him with 24 - 3 = 21 toys.

So, the total number of toys James needs is 21."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The total initial investment is $1200.

2. Dylan invests 2/5 of the total amount:
   \[
   \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = 480

"To reach their goal of 100 signatures, we first need to determine how many signatures they currently have together. Carol has 20 signatures and Jennifer has 44 signatures. Adding these together:

20 + 44 = 64 signatures

Now, we need to find out how many more signatures they need to collect to reach 100:

100 - 64 = 36 signatures

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer."
"First, let's determine Karen's hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many hours Karen works in two days. If she works 3 hours per day, then in two days she works:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate Karen's earnings for those 6 hours. Since she earns $20 per hour, her total earnings for two days are:

\[ 20 \times 6 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Karen earns \(\boxed{120}\) dollars in two days."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion based on the given information.

If 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, then the ratio of potatoes to hash browns is 6:36, which simplifies to 1:6. This means that for every potato, you can make 6 hash browns.

Now, if you have 96 potatoes, you can calculate the number of hash browns by multiplying the number of potatoes by the ratio of hash browns per potato:

96 potatoes * 6 hash browns/potato = 576 hash browns

So, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes."
"To determine by how much the group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we need to calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults, and then compare it to the elevator's maximum load.

1. Calculate the total weight of the 9 adults:
   - Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg.
   - There are 9 adults in total (Jack + 8 other adults).

   Total weight = 9 adults * 80 kg/adult = 720 kg

2. Compare the total weight to the elevator's maximum load:
   - The elevator's maximum load is 700 kg.
   - The total weight of the group is 720 kg.

3. Calculate the excess weight:
   - Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
   - Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg

The group will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"Given that Katarina has 68 cookies, we can work backwards to find out how many cookies Max and the Cookie Monster have.

1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has \(68 + 5 = 73\) cookies.
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has \(73 - 12 = 61\) cookies.
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has \(73 + 23 = 96\) cookies.

Now, to find the total number of cookies they have, we add up the cookies each one has:

- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

Total cookies = \(68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298\)

Therefore, they have a total of 298 cookies."
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the extension is \( 0.5x \) cm. Additionally, she adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom. Therefore, the total length of the dress after these modifications is:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 \]

We know that the final length of the dress is 140 cm. So, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]

\[ x = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

Final answer: 80"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's find the mowing rates for both modes:

- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour, which is 60 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""turtle"" mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} \).
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""rabbit"" mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} \).

Now, we need to find out how long it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode:

- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes} \).
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes} \).

Finally, we add the times for both halves of the lawn:

- Total time = 30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes.

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn."
"John and Jack have 30 minutes in total to walk to school. They have already spent 6 minutes to get to the corner and another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. 

First, we add the time spent so far:
6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

"Greta bakes 30 cookies. Celinda bakes twice as many, which means Celinda bakes \(30 \times 2 = 60\) cookies.

Together, they have \(30 + 60 = 90\) cookies.

They eat 10 of the cookies, so the number of cookies left is \(90 - 10 = 80\).

Therefore, there are 80 cookies in the box."
"Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as \( x \). Therefore, the age of the older triplet would be \( x + 7 \) since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet.

Since there is one set of twins, the age of each twin is the same. Let's denote the age of each twin as \( y \).

The combined ages of the four individuals (one twin, one triplet, and the other two triplets) are given as 44. So, we can write the equation as:

\[ y + (x + 7) + x + x = 44 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ y + 3x + 7 = 44 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ y + 3x = 37 \]

Since the twins are the same age, and the triplets are \( x \) and \( x + 7 \), we need to find the value of \( y \). We can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):

\[ y = 37 - 3x \]

Now, we need to find integer values for \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy this equation. Since \( x \) and \( y \) must be positive integers, we can test values for \( x \):

If \( x = 9 \):

\[ y = 37 - 3(9) = 37 - 27 = 10 \]

So, the age of the younger triplet is 9, and the age of the older triplet is 16. The age of each twin is 10.

Therefore, the age of one of the twins is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"

Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that each lollipop costs $0.40. Manolo bought five lollipops, so the cost for the lollipops is:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

Next, we know that the total cost for four candies and five lollipops is $3.20. We already calculated that the five lollipops cost $2.00, so the cost for the four candies is:
\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

Now, we can find the cost of one candy by dividing the total cost of the four candies by 4:
\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

So, each candy costs $0.30. Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost for 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

And the cost for 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Adding these together gives us the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many coins Neil saves each month. Since Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong, we can calculate Neil's monthly savings as follows:

Rong saves 20 coins per month. Neil saves \( 20 + \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \) coins per month.

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

So, Neil saves \( 20 + 8 = 28 \) coins per month.

Now, let's calculate the total number of coins saved by both Rong and Neil over ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so over ten years, there are \( 10 \times 12 = 120 \) months.

Rong's total savings over ten years:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings over ten years:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding both totals together gives us the combined total:
\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \]

Therefore, the total number of coins they have after ten years is 5760."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and the dog needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:

\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Let the total bill be \( T \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:

\[ 0.60 \times T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:

\[ T = 40 + 0.60 \times T \]

To find \( T \), we can rearrange the equation:

\[ T - 0.60 \times T = 40 \]
\[ 0.40 \times T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. Therefore, the amount he leaves with is:

\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

John leaves with $25."
"To find the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - Therefore, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = \$1.0\).
   - There are 5 bananas in a crate.
   - The total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = \$5.0\).

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in a crate.
   - The total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = \$6.0\).

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - Oranges cost three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1.0.
   - Therefore, one orange costs \(3 \times 1.0 = \$3.0\).
   - There are 7 oranges in a crate.
   - The total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = \$21.0\).

4. **Total Cost of the Crate:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges.
   - Total cost = Cost of bananas + Cost of apples + Cost of oranges
   - Total cost = \$5.0 + \$6.0 + \$21.0 = \$32.0

The price for such a crate of fruit is \(\$32.0\)."
"To find the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter, we need to determine the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. Red squares: 14
2. Blue squares: 4 more than red squares, so \(14 + 4 = 18\)
3. Green squares: 6 more than blue squares, so \(18 + 6 = 24\)
4. White squares: 12 fewer than green squares, so \(24 - 12 = 12\)

Now, we add up all the squares:
\[14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68\]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

1. **Determine the number of high chairs needed:**
   - The problem states that there are 8 high chairs.

2. **Calculate the number of regular chairs needed:**
   - The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs.
   - Therefore, the number of regular chairs = 5 * 8 = 40.

3. **Calculate the total number of chairs needed:**
   - The total number of chairs needed = number of high chairs + number of regular chairs.
   - Total chairs needed = 8 + 40 = 48.

4. **Determine the total number of people attending:**
   - There are 42 adults and 15 babies.
   - Total people = 42 + 15 = 57.

5. **Calculate the number of additional chairs needed:**
   - The number of additional chairs needed = total people - total chairs available.
   - Since the restaurant already has 48 chairs, the additional chairs needed = 57 - 48 = 9.

Therefore, Mia has to get 9 more chairs."
"To find the number of 8 point bucks, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bucks in the field.
2. Calculate the number of 8 point bucks from the total number of bucks.

Step 1: Calculate the number of bucks.
50 percent of the 50 deer are bucks. So, we calculate:
\[ 50 \times \frac{50}{100} = 25 \]
There are 25 bucks in the field.

Step 2: Calculate the number of 8 point bucks.
20 percent of the bucks are 8 points. So, we calculate:
\[ 25 \times \frac{20}{100} = 5 \]
There are 5 8 point bucks in the field.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's calculate the points collected by each student:

1. Adam has collected 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more than Adam. So, Betty's points are:
   \[ 50 + (0.30 \times 50) = 50 + 15 = 65 \]
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom's points are:
   \[ 65 - 30 = 35 \]
4. Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. So, Martha's points are:
   \[ 3 \times 35 = 105 \]

Now, let's sum up the points collected by all the students:
\[ 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 \]

The class needs a total of 400 points to go on the trip. Therefore, the points the class is missing are:
\[ 400 - 255 = 145 \]

The class is missing 145 points to go on the trip."

2. Each of her children has 3 children of their own, which means there are \(3 \times 3 = 9\) grandchildren.
3. Each of these grandchildren has 3 babies of their own, which means there are \(9 \times 3 = 27\) great-grandbabies.

Therefore, the number of great-grandbabies at the family reunion is 27."
"First, let's calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400 paycheck into her retirement account:

\[ 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

So, she puts $1200 into her retirement account.

Next, we calculate how much she uses for her monthly car payment. She uses 20% of her paycheck for this:

\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

So, she uses $480 for her car payment.

Now, we subtract the amounts she has spent from her total paycheck to find out how much she has left to spend:

\[ 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Therefore, Greta has $720 left to spend."

"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person saves a seat and buys enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats. Since each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks, and there are 20 people, the group will buy:

- \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) drinks
- \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) snacks

Each drink and snack costs $2, so the total cost for drinks is:

\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

And the total cost for snacks is:

\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount spent on drinks and snacks:

\[ 80 + 120 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the group has spent a total of:

\[ \boxed{200} \] dollars on snacks and drinks."
"Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so:
\[ 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 \text{ pounds} \]

When Gary's truck joins, the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel. So, the amount Gary's truck can haul is:
\[ 11,600 - (4,000 + 4,800) = 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 \text{ pounds} \]

Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Number of Females and Males:**
   - There are 6 females.
   - There are 8 males, including Larry.

2. **Dumplings Eaten by Females:**
   - Each female ate 3 dumplings.
   - Total dumplings eaten by females = 6 females * 3 dumplings/female = 18 dumplings.

3. **Dumplings Eaten by Males:**
   - Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female.
   - Therefore, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.
   - Total dumplings eaten by males = 8 males * 4 dumplings/male = 32 dumplings.

4. **Total Dumplings Cooked:**
   - Total dumplings = Dumplings eaten by females + Dumplings eaten by males
   - Total dumplings = 18 dumplings + 32 dumplings = 50 dumplings.

Therefore, Larry cooked a total of 50 dumplings."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much money Gerald and Julia each received when they divided $100 in the ratio 3:2.

The total parts of the ratio 3:2 add up to 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Each part is therefore worth $100 / 5 = $20.

Gerald's share, being 3 parts, is 3 * $20 = $60.

Julia's share, being 2 parts, is 2 * $20 = $40.

Now, if Gerald spent $10 on a book, the amount of money he has left is $60 - $10 = $50.

Therefore, Gerald has $50 left."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of Martha's turtle.

Given that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, and the cat can run at a speed of 15 feet/second, we can calculate the turtle's speed as follows:

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{\text{Cat's speed}}{5} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now, to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance crawled by turtle} = \text{Turtle's speed} \times \text{Time} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find out how many more hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first need to determine how much more money they need to raise. 

The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount they need to raise is:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money they raise per hour. They raised $2100 in the first 3 hours, so the amount raised per hour is:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Now, to find out how many more hours they need to fundraise to raise the remaining $4200, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

So, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours. 

Therefore, the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal is the initial 3 hours plus the additional 6 hours:

\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract the industrial usage from the total city usage to find the non-industrial usage.

Step 1: The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. So, the industrial usage is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 \text{ or } 32\% \]

Step 2: Subtract the industrial usage from the total city usage to find the non-industrial usage:
\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

Therefore, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

8%"

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the production rate for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream and then calculate the total production over 48 hours.

First, let's find the production rate for chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Next, let's find the production rate for vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Now, we calculate the total production over 48 hours for both types of ice cream:
- For chocolate ice cream: \( 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).
- For vanilla ice cream: \( 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Finally, we add the production of both types of ice cream to get the total production:
- Total production = \( 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \).

Therefore, the total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 3000 quarts."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Marcus ordered:

- Croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each = 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each = 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 muffins at $1.00 each = 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost before the discount:

Total cost = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off, we need to calculate 10% of $50.00 and subtract it from the total:

10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Subtracting the discount from the total cost:

Total bill after discount = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is $45.00."
"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin should buy, we need to understand the deal and how it affects the number of scoops she can get with her $6.00.

The deal is: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's calculate the cost for 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free):
\[ 2 \text{ scoops} \times \$1.50 = \$3.00 \]

So, for every $3.00, Erin gets 3 scoops of ice cream.

Now, let's see how many sets of 3 scoops she can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{\$6.00}{\$3.00} = 2 \]

This means Erin can get 2 sets of 3 scoops, which is:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, Erin should buy 2 sets of 2 scoops to maximize her ice cream consumption with the deal, resulting in a total of 6 scoops.

"Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she will have eaten:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy eats 3 pieces of candy a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she will have eaten:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Both started with 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, Ginger will have:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

And Amy will have:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

To find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger after two weeks, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks."
"To find out how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden would need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the area that needs to be covered: two thirds of the 36 square feet bathroom.
2. Determine the number of tiles needed for that area, given that 24 tiles are required per square foot.

First, calculate two thirds of the bathroom area:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \text{ sq ft} = 24 \text{ sq ft} \]

Next, since Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles per square foot, we multiply the area to be covered by the number of tiles per square foot:
\[ 24 \text{ sq ft} \times 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft} = 576 \text{ tiles} \]

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom."
"To determine how much James saved, we need to calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries and compare it to the cost of buying the same amount at the store.

1. **Cost of picking the blueberries:**
   - Initial cost to go picking: $20
   - Cost per pound: $1.5
   - Pounds of blueberries picked: 30

   Total cost for picking = Initial cost + (Cost per pound * Pounds picked)
   Total cost for picking = $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
   Total cost for picking = $20 + $45
   Total cost for picking = $65

2. **Cost of buying the blueberries at the store:**
   - Cost per pound at the store: $2.5
   - Pounds of blueberries: 30

   Total cost at the store = Cost per pound * Pounds
   Total cost at the store = $2.5 * 30
   Total cost at the store = $75

3. **Savings:**
   Savings = Total cost at the store - Total cost for picking
   Savings = $75 - $65
   Savings = $10

James saved $10 compared to buying the blueberries at the store."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new price of each computer after the 10% increase.
2. Multiply the new price by the number of computers (500) to find the total amount paid.

Let's start with step 1. The original price per computer was $700. A 10% increase on $700 is calculated as follows:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 700 = 0.10 \times 700 = 70 \]

So, the new price per computer is:

\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, for step 2, we multiply the new price per computer by the number of computers:

\[ 770 \times 500 = 385,000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:

\[ \boxed{385000} \]"
"To calculate the total calories in John's omelet, we need to consider the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

1. **Eggs**: John uses 6 eggs. Each egg is 75 calories.
   \[
   6 \text{ eggs} \times 75 \text{ calories/egg} = 450 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Cheese**: John uses 2 oz of cheese. Cheese is 120 calories per ounce.
   \[

"First, let's calculate the total number of pizzas ordered. Since Bryce and his four friends each ordered one pizza, the total number of pizzas is:

\[ 1 + 4 = 5 \]

Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends. Each of these three people ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \( \frac{2}{3} \) of a pizza is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \]

So, the three of them together ate:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we calculate the number of slices eaten by the two remaining friends. Each of these two people ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizza. So, \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a pizza is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \]

So, the two of them together ate:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Adding the slices eaten by all five friends, we get:

\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \]

Therefore, the number of slices left is:

\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \]

Final answer:

The average time the two take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe into inches, and then use the given relationship to find the length of Bobby's shoe.

1. Convert the length of Topher's shoe to inches:
   - Topher's shoe length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches.
   - Since 1 foot = 12 inches, 8 feet = 8 * 12 = 96 inches.
   - Therefore, Topher's shoe length in inches is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

2. Use the given relationship to find the length of Bobby's shoe:
   - The length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe.
   - Let \( B \) be the length of Bobby's shoe in inches.
   - According to the problem, \( 100 = 9B + 10 \).

3. Solve for \( B \):
   - Subtract 10 from both sides: \( 100 - 10 = 9B \)
   - Simplify: \( 90 = 9B \)
   - Divide both sides by 9: \( B = \frac{90}{9} = 10 \)

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."

- Each student's car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The number of students' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 64 = 16 \]

Since each of these 16 cars has 4 windows, the total number of windows smashed for the students' cars is:
\[ 16 \times 4 = 64 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teacher's car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows.

The number of teachers' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 32 = 24 \]

Since each of these 24 cars has 2 windows, the total number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars is:
\[ 24 \times 2 = 48 \]

Finally, we add the number of windows smashed for both students' cars and teachers' cars to get the total number of windows smashed:
\[ 64 + 48 = 112 \]

15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60 blue spools

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\% \]

Therefore, 40% of Candy's spools are blue."
"At 8:00, there were 5000 people in line to vote.

By midday (12:00), \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the people had voted. So, the number of people who had voted by midday is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \]

The number of people remaining in line by midday is:
\[ 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \]

By 16:00, \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the remaining people had voted. So, the number of people who had voted by 16:00 from the remaining 3000 is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \]

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:
\[ 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \]

Final numerical answer:

"Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. Over 30 days, he will chew:

\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Since each pack contains 15 pieces of gum, the number of packs he will need is:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of smores needed:**
   - **Kids:** 9 kids want 2 smores each, so \(9 \times 2 = 18\) smores.
   - **Adults:** 6 adults want 1 smore each, so \(6 \times 1 = 6\) smores.
   - **Total smores needed:** \(18 + 6 = 24\) smores.

2. **Calculate the number of smores that can be made from one box of graham crackers:**
   - Each sleeve makes 8 smores.
   - There are 3 sleeves in a box, so \(3 \times 8 = 24\) smores per box.

3. **Determine the number of boxes needed:**
   - Since 24 smores are needed and 24 smores can be made from one box, they will need \( \frac{24}{24} = 1 \) box.

Therefore, they will need **1 box** of graham crackers."
"Given that Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate the ages of her father and mother as follows:

1. Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we calculate her father's age as:
\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

2. Dora's mother is four years younger than her father. So, we calculate her mother's age as:
\[ \text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Now, we can find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:
\[ \text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

Therefore, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87."
"To find out how much money each of them got, we need to divide the total amount of money by the number of people sharing it. Greg and his 3 younger siblings make a total of 4 people.

"To find the total weight of Cindy's books, we need to add the weight of each book together.

- Math and science books: 2 pounds each, and there are 2 of them, so \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds.
- French book: 4 pounds.
- English book: 3 pounds.
- History book: twice the weight of the English book, so \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds.

Now, we add all these weights together:

\[4 \text{ (math and science)} + 4 \text{ (French)} + 3 \text{ (English)} + 6 \text{ (history)} = 17 \text{ pounds}\]

The total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds."

\[ 20\% \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes} \]

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes. So, candidate B received:
\[ 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ votes} \]

The total votes for candidates A and B are:
\[ 20 + 30 = 50 \text{ votes} \]

Since there were 100 voters in total, the number of votes for candidate C is:
\[ 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ votes} \]

Candidate C got 50 votes."
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, Beck has:

\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Next, if Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Boris will have:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]

And Beck will have:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this exchange, we subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris.

\[ \text{Number of books Steven has} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so:

\[ \text{Number of books Alice has} = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:

\[ \text{Difference} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice."
"Given that a gallon jar costs $5 and it costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can determine the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

\[ \text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]
\[ \text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives us the total amount of money spent:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 50 + 48 = 98 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars is $98."

"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

1. **Weekday Rentals:**
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays.
   - Since 60 chairs are rented each weekday, the total number of chairs rented during weekdays in one 4-week month is \(60 \times 20 = 1200\) chairs.

2. **Weekend Rentals:**
   - There are 2 weekend days in a week.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.
   - Since 100 chairs are rented each weekend day, the total number of chairs rented during weekends in one 4-week month is \(100 \times 8 = 800\) chairs.

3. **Total Rentals in One 4-Week Month:**
   - The total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month is the sum of weekday and weekend rentals, which is \(1200 + 800 = 2000\) chairs.

   - A small sticker is worth one small button.
   - A large button is worth three small stickers.

2. **Lorraine's Initial Stickers:**
   - 30 small stickers
   - 40 large stickers

3. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons.

5. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3.5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 3.5:
\[ x = \frac{250}{3.5} = \frac{2500}{35} = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases of shingles, so:
\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Therefore, the third house will need \(\boxed{142.86}\) cases of shingles."

Each candy bar costs $5. To find out how many candy bars Marissa could buy with the remaining $60, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one candy bar:

$60 ÷ $5 = 12

Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy."
"To make 1 liter of juice, Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges. Therefore, to make 4 liters of juice, Sam would need:

\[ 5 \, \text{kg/liter} \times 4 \, \text{liters} = 20 \, \text{kg} \]

Each kilogram of oranges costs $3. So, for 20 kilograms of oranges, the cost would be:

\[ 20 \, \text{kg} \times \$3/\text{kg} = \$60 \]

Sam would have to spend \(\$60\) to make 4 liters of juice."
"Ezra read 300 books in one hour and decided to read 150 more. So, the total number of books Ezra read is:

300 + 150 = 450 books

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour, Ahmed read half the number of books Ezra read in that hour:

300 / 2 = 150 books

Altogether, the number of books they have read is:

450 (Ezra) + 150 (Ahmed) = 600 books

600"
"To calculate Tanya's earnings for the two days, we need to break down her earnings for each day and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour, so for 5 hours, she earns \(5 \times 15 = 75\) dollars.
- Since she taught more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5, making her total for Monday \(75 + 5 = 80\) dollars.

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour, so for 2 hours, she earns \(2 \times 15 = 30\) dollars.
- Since she did not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5.

Now, we sum up her earnings for both days:
- Monday: $80
- Wednesday: $30

Total earnings: \(80 + 30 = 110\) dollars.

**Final numerical answer:**
110"
"To find out how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type sold and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold:
- They sell 5 of each of the 4 vanilla scents.
- Total vanilla scents sold = 5 * 4 = 20

Next, let's calculate the total number of fruity scents sold:
- They sell 2 of each of the 8 fruity scents.
- Total fruity scents sold = 2 * 8 = 16

Now, we find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold:
- Difference = Vanilla scents sold - Fruity scents sold
- Difference = 20 - 16 = 4

Therefore, 4 more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents."
"First, let's calculate how much money Bennet makes from selling the eggplants.

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total from the eggplants is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Bennet wants to make a total of $135. To find out how much more money he needs to make from selling the corn, we subtract the money he already made from the total he wants to make:
\[ 135 - 60 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the remaining amount of money he needs to make by the number of ears of corn:
\[ \frac{75}{25} = 3 \text{ dollars per ear of corn} \]

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of time Tatiana has for her weekend activities:

Total time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Next, we subtract the time she spends reading:

Time left after reading = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

Now, she plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time:

Time spent on video games = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

So, the time left for playing soccer is:

Time for soccer = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time for soccer}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{12 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

Therefore, Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer."
"Anthony initially had 50 pencils.

First, he gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]
So, Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon, leaving him with:
\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \]

Next, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15 \]
So, Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie, leaving him with:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils."
"To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time he spends driving to the museum, the time he spends driving back, and the time he spends at the museum.

1. **Time to the museum:**
   - Distance to the museum: 150 miles
   - Speed: 75 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

2. **Time back from the museum:**
   - The distance back is the same, 150 miles, and the speed is the same, 75 mph.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

3. **Time spent at the museum:**
   - Jack spends 6 hours at the museum.

4. **Total time gone:**
   - Total time = Time to the museum + Time at the museum + Time back from the museum
   - Total time = 2 hours + 6 hours + 2 hours = 10 hours

Therefore, Jack is gone from home for a total of 10 hours."
"To find out how many wheels Henry will need to assemble all the toys, we can calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles separately, and then sum them up.

For the cars:
- Henry needs to assemble 57 cars.
- Each car requires 4 wheels.
- Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is \(57 \times 4 = 228\) wheels.

For the motorcycles:
- Henry needs to assemble 73 motorcycles.
- Each motorcycle requires 2 wheels.
- Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is \(73 \times 2 = 146\) wheels.

Now, we add the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles to find the total number of wheels required:
- Total wheels required = \(228 + 146 = 374\) wheels.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling all the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the number of wheels in the box:
- Wheels left = \(650 - 374 = 276\) wheels.

Therefore, the number of wheels that will be left is 276."

20% of $1000 is calculated as:
\[ 1000 \times \frac{20}{100} = 1000 \times 0.20 = 200 \]

Subtract the discount from the original price:
\[ 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

So, after a 20% discount, you have to pay $800."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total number of movies**: 600

2. **Movies in series**: A third of the movies are in series, so:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \text{ movies}
   \]
   The cost for these series is $6 each, so the total cost for the series is:
   \[
   200 \times 6 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Remaining movies**: Subtract the movies in series from the total:
   \[
   600 - 200 = 400 \text{ movies}
   \]

4. **Older movies**: 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so:
   \[
   0.4 \times 400 = 160 \text{ movies}
   \]
   The cost for these older movies is $5 each, so the total cost for the older movies is:
   \[
   160 \times 5 = 800 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Normal movies**: The remaining movies are normal movies, so:
   \[
   400 - 160 = 240 \text{ movies}
   \]
   The cost for these normal movies is $10 each, so the total cost for the normal movies is:
   \[
   240 \times 10 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Total cost**: Add up the costs for the series, older movies, and normal movies:
   \[
   1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

**Final numerical answer:**

"To find out how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost for each type of fruit he picked and then sum these costs.

1. **Peaches**: 
   - Price per pound: $2.00
   - Pounds picked: 6
   - Total cost for peaches: \(6 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$12.00\)

2. **Plums**: 
   - Price per pound: $1.00
   - Pounds picked: 8
   - Total cost for plums: \(8 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00\)

3. **Apricots**: 
   - Price per pound: $3.00
   - Pounds picked: 6
   - Total cost for apricots: \(6 \text{ pounds} \times \$3.00/\text{pound} = \$18.00\)

Now, we sum the total costs for each type of fruit to find the overall cost:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \$12.00 + \$8.00 + \$18.00 = \$38.00
\]

Therefore, Winston spent \(\$38.00\) on fruit."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the Llesis family, which is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked.

1. **Driving Distance:**
   - They drove for a certain number of hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.
   - Let's denote the time spent driving as \( t_d \) hours.
   - The distance driven is \( 50 \times t_d \) miles.

2. **Hiking Distance:**
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours at an average speed of \( \frac{50}{2} - 5 = 25 - 5 = 20 \) miles per hour.
   - The distance hiked is \( 20 \times 1.5 \) miles.

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time spent traveling is 6 hours, which is the sum of the time spent driving and hiking.
   - Therefore, \( t_d + 1.5 = 6 \).
   - Solving for \( t_d \), we get \( t_d = 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 \) hours.

4. **Total Distance:**
   - The total distance is the sum of the driving distance and the hiking distance.
   - Driving distance: \( 50 \times 4.5 = 225 \) miles.
   - Hiking distance: \( 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \) miles.
   - Total distance: \( 225 + 30 = 255 \) miles.

"Let's break down the scoring for both Ava and Emma based on the given information:

1. **Enemies Jumped On:**
   - Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
   - Points for each enemy = 10 points.
   - If Emma jumps on \(E\) enemies, then Ava jumps on \(E + 8\) enemies.
   - Emma's score from enemies = \(10E\).
   - Ava's score from enemies = \(10(E + 8) = 10E + 80\).

2. **Berries Collected:**
   - Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
   - Points for each berry = 5 points.
   - If Emma collects \(B\) berries, then Ava collects \(B + 3\) berries.
   - Emma's score from berries = \(5B\).
   - Ava's score from berries = \(5(B + 3) = 5B + 15\).

3. **Time Left on the Timer:**
   - Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma.
   - Points for each second left = 30 points.
   - If Emma has \(T\) seconds left, then Ava has \(T + 4\) seconds left.
   - Emma's score from time = \(30T\).
   - Ava's score from time = \(30(T + 4) = 30T + 120\).

Now, let's calculate the total scores for both:

- Emma's total score = \(10E + 5B + 30T\).
- Ava's total score = \(10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T + 120 = 10E + 5B + 30T + 115\).

The difference between their scores is:

\[ (10E + 5B + 30T + 115) - (10E + 5B + 30T) = 115 \]

Therefore, the difference between their two scores is 115."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The total cost of the four pizzas is $64.
2. Two of the pizzas cost $30 in total.
3. We need to find the cost of each of the other two pizzas, which cost the same amount.

First, we calculate the total cost of the other two pizzas:
\[ \text{Total cost of four pizzas} - \text{Total cost of two pizzas} = \text{Total cost of other two pizzas} \]
\[ 64 - 30 = 34 \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of these two pizzas by 2:
\[ \text{Cost of each of the other two pizzas} = \frac{34}{2} = 17 \]

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas cost $17.

"Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days, which amounts to:

3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides

On the two other days, they ride twice the times they do on the usual days, so:

2 * (3 rides/day) * 2 days = 12 rides

Adding these together gives the total number of rides in a week:

15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides

They ride their bikes 27 times a week."
"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish as \( W \). Initially, Bob had 3 orange and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had \( 3 + O \) orange fish and \( 4 + W \) white fish. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

We also know that the total number of fish he bought is 17, so:

\[ O + W = 17 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

First, let's simplify the first equation:

\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]
\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

Now we have the simplified system:
1. \( O - 2W = 5 \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

We can solve these equations by elimination or substitution. Let's use substitution. From the second equation, we can express \( O \) in terms of \( W \):

\[ O = 17 - W \]

Substitute this into the first equation:

\[ 17 - W - 2W = 5 \]
\[ 17 - 3W = 5 \]
\[ -3W = 5 - 17 \]
\[ -3W = -12 \]
\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find the number of orange fish he bought, we substitute \( W = 4 \) back into the equation \( O = 17 - W \):

\[ O = 17 - 4 = 13 \]

To verify, we check the condition that after adding the new fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish:

\[ 3 + 13 = 16 \]
\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \]
\[ 16 = 2 \times 8 \]

The condition is satisfied. Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To calculate how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Andy travels to work in a week.
2. Determine the amount of fuel used for this distance.
3. Calculate the cost of the fuel used.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance traveled in a week.**

Andy travels 5 miles one way to work. Therefore, the round trip is 10 miles. He does this from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days a week.

Total distance per week = 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week

**Step 2: Determine the amount of fuel used.**

Andy's car has a fuel efficiency of 10 miles per gallon (MPG). This means for every 10 miles, he uses 1 gallon of fuel.

Fuel used per week = Total distance per week / Fuel efficiency
Fuel used per week = 50 miles/week / 10 miles/gallon = 5 gallons/week

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the fuel used.**

The price of regular gas is $3 per gallon.

Cost per week = Fuel used per week * Price per gallon
Cost per week = 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week

Therefore, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week on fuel for his commute to work."

So, the total number of tomatoes is:
\[ 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} \times 5 \text{ plants} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants.

So, the total number of eggplants is:
\[ 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} \times 8 \text{ plants} = 32 \text{ eggplants} \]

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:

3. Calculate the number of OLED TVs sold by subtracting the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total:
   \[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (\text{Number of smart TVs} + \text{Number of analog TVs}) \]
   \[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (10 + 5) = 40 - 15 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25."
"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total cost of the trip.
2. Calculate the amount the school will cover.
3. Calculate the amount John still needs to raise.
4. Subtract the amount John already has from the amount he still needs to raise.

The total cost of the trip is $300. The school will cover half of this cost, so the school will contribute:
\[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

This means John needs to raise the other half of the cost, which is also $150. Since John already has $50, the amount he still needs to raise is:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the amount of money John is missing is:

To prevent the pipes from freezing, Carson needs to raise the temperature from 12 degrees to 32 degrees. The difference in temperature that needs to be raised is:
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Since each log of wood burns raises the temperature by 5 degrees, the number of logs needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees is:
\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing."
"First, we need to determine the number of 9-person groups that can be formed from 90 people. This is calculated by dividing the total number of people by the group size:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Billy's Salary Calculation:**
   - Billy's starting hourly rate: $10 per hour.
   - After 2 months, his hourly rate increased by $0.50, so his new rate is $10.50 per hour.
   - On his first anniversary, his hourly rate increased by $1.00, so his final rate is $11.50 per hour.
   - If Billy works 20 hours, his earnings are: $11.50 * 20 = $230.

2. **Sally's Salary Calculation:**
   - Sally's starting hourly rate is $0.50 more than Billy's starting rate, so her starting rate is $10.50 per hour.
   - If Sally works 20 hours, her earnings are: $10.50 * 20 = $210.

3. **Difference in Earnings:**
   - The difference in earnings between Billy and Sally is: $230 - $210 = $20.

So, Billy will earn $20 more than Sally."
"To find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels, we need to calculate the total cost of each and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of 3 loaves of bread:
- Each loaf of bread costs $2.
- Therefore, 3 loaves of bread cost \(3 \times 2 = 6\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of 2 bagels:
- Each bagel costs $1.
- Therefore, 2 bagels cost \(2 \times 1 = 2\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference between the cost of 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels:
- The difference is \(6 - 2 = 4\) dollars.

So, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels."
"First, let's calculate how many points Nikita scored. We know that Nikita scored 11 more than half as many points as Pierson. Pierson scored 278 points.

Half of Pierson's points is:
\[ \frac{278}{2} = 139 \]

Nikita scored 11 more than this amount:
\[ 139 + 11 = 150 \]

Now, to find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we add their scores together:
\[ 278 + 150 = 428 \]

Therefore, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is:
428"
"To calculate the total number of trees planted, we need to consider both the students and the teachers' contributions.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students:
- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has 25 students.
- Each student plants 1 tree.

So, the total number of trees planted by the students is:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has 3 teachers.
- Each teacher plants 2 trees.

So, the total number of trees planted by the teachers is:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Now, we add the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers to get the total number of trees planted:
\[ 1000 \text{ trees} + 240 \text{ trees} = 1240 \text{ trees} \]

Therefore, at the end of the campaign, they will have planted 1240 trees."
"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 stuffed animals

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy as \( x \). After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides by \( 14 + x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Subtract \( 0.30x \) from both sides to isolate \( x \):

\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]

\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Divide both sides by 0.70:

\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]

\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats."
"To find out how many hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, let's break down the problem into parts.

1. Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks.
   - There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks have 14 days.
   - Half an hour each day for 14 days is \(0.5 \times 14 = 7\) hours.

2. Kris then plays for 2 hours every day for a week.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - 2 hours each day for 7 days is \(2 \times 7 = 14\) hours.

Now, let's add the hours from both parts:
- Total hours played = \(7 + 14 = 21\) hours.

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. So, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
- \(30 - 21 = 9\) hours.

Therefore, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. The first car travels at 60 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it will travel:
   \[
   60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. The second car travels at 70 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it will travel:
   \[
   70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. The difference in distance between the second car and the first car after 2 hours is:
   \[
   140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}
   \]

So, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car."
"To find out how much James paid for the ring, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the materials (diamond and gold).
2. Calculate the 30% premium on the total cost of the materials.
3. Add the premium to the total cost of the materials to get the final amount James paid.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the materials.
The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300.
Total cost of materials = $600 + $300 = $900

Step 2: Calculate the 30% premium.
30% of $900 = 0.30 * $900 = $270

Step 3: Add the premium to the total cost of the materials.
Final amount paid = Total cost of materials + Premium
Final amount paid = $900 + $270 = $1170

Therefore, James paid $1170 for the ring."
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students, then divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students.

First, let's calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders, so it's \(2 \times \frac{40}{100} = \frac{80}{100} = 0.8\). Therefore, 400 fifth-graders had \(400 \times 0.8 = 320\) pass.

Now, let's sum up the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total students who passed: \(340 + 40 + 320 = 680\)
- Total students: \(500 + 100 + 400 = 1000\)

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students:

\[
\text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{680}{1000} = 0.68
\]

Expressing this as a percentage:

\[
0.68 \times 100 = 68\%
\]

The school's overall pass rate is 68%."
"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of the mosaic he can make with the total number of chips.
3. Calculate the length of the mosaic given its height.

First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has in total. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, we multiply:

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12:

\[ 144 \text{ chips} \div 12 \text{ chips/square inch} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Now, we know the mosaic will be 3 inches tall. To find the length of the mosaic, we divide the total area by the height:

\[ 12 \text{ square inches} \div 3 \text{ inches} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of the mosaic Milo can make is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find out how many gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party, we first need to calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students and then add the remaining tea to find the initial amount.

1. Calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the four students:
   - Each of the four students drank 1.5 quarts.
   - Total for four students: \(4 \times 1.5 = 6\) quarts.

2. Calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the sixteen students:
   - Each of the sixteen students drank 2 quarts.
   - Total for sixteen students: \(16 \times 2 = 32\) quarts.

3. Add the tea consumed by all students to the remaining tea:
   - Total tea consumed: \(6 + 32 = 38\) quarts.
   - Remaining tea: 10 quarts.
   - Initial amount of tea: \(38 + 10 = 48\) quarts.

4. Convert the initial amount of tea from quarts to gallons (1 gallon = 4 quarts):
   - Initial amount in gallons: \(48 \div 4 = 12\) gallons.

Final numerical answer:
12 gallons"
"Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 butterscotch candies, which means he needed to order more to meet the demand. He then ordered an additional 100 candies. 

To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and then subtract the number of candies he has already sold.

Total candies Dale has = Initial candies + Additional ordered candies
Total candies Dale has = 100 + 100 = 200

Candies already sold = 150

Candies still to be sold = Total candies - Candies already sold
Candies still to be sold = 200 - 150 = 50

Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month, starting from the beginning of the year, and then find the difference between the number of students at the end of May and the initial number of students.

Let's denote the number of students at the beginning of the year as \( S_0 = 10 \).

At the end of each month, the number of students doubles. So, the number of students at the end of each month can be calculated as follows:

- End of January: \( S_1 = 2 \times S_0 = 2 \times 10 = 20 \)
- End of February: \( S_2 = 2 \times S_1 = 2 \times 20 = 40 \)
- End of March: \( S_3 = 2 \times S_2 = 2 \times 40 = 80 \)
- End of April: \( S_4 = 2 \times S_3 = 2 \times 80 = 160 \)
- End of May: \( S_5 = 2 \times S_4 = 2 \times 160 = 320 \)

Now, to find the additional students that joined by the end of May, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:

\[ \text{Additional students} = S_5 - S_0 = 320 - 10 = 310 \]

Therefore, the number of additional students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. He made $105 during the week. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25} = 420 \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches climbed per day:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \]

Therefore, on average, Felix climbed 60 branches per day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picked:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\]

Rose drops 1 of each type of flower, so she drops:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\]

Subtracting the petals of the dropped flowers from the initial total gives:
\[101 - 22 = 79\]

Therefore, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:
79"
"First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores:

- John makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.
- DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.

Total marshmallows used by both = 9 (John) + 9 (DeSean) = 18 marshmallows.

Next, we need to account for the marshmallows that were dropped on the ground:

- Marshmallows dropped = 3.

Now, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows that are no longer available for making S'mores:

- Total marshmallows used + marshmallows dropped = 18 + 3 = 21 marshmallows.

The original number of marshmallows in the bag was 35. So, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is:

- Marshmallows left = Original number - Total used and dropped = 35 - 21 = 14 marshmallows.

Since John and DeSean are sharing the remaining marshmallows equally, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2:

- Marshmallows each can have = 14 / 2 = 7 marshmallows.

Therefore, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Jack's Game Time:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
   - They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.
   - Jack's total game time is 240 minutes.
   - The number of quarters Jack uses is \( \frac{240}{20} = 12 \) quarters.

2. **Friends' Game Times:**
   - Two friends can play half as long as Jack, so they can play for \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) minutes per quarter.
   - The better friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for \( 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \) minutes per quarter.
   - The total game time for the two friends who play half as long is \( \frac{240}{2} = 120 \) minutes.
   - The number of quarters each of these two friends uses is \( \frac{120}{10} = 12 \) quarters.
   - The total game time for the better friend is 240 minutes.
   - The number of quarters the better friend uses is \( \frac{240}{30} = 8 \) quarters.

3. **Total Quarters Used:**
   - Jack uses 12 quarters.
   - Each of the two friends who play half as long uses 12 quarters, so together they use \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) quarters.
   - The better friend uses 8 quarters.
   - The total number of quarters used is \( 12 + 24 + 8 = 44 \) quarters.

Therefore, the total amount of money used is 44 quarters."
"Let's denote the amount of citrus zest used as \( z \) ounces. Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.

The amount of salt used is \( s \) ounces. Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.

The amount of oil used is \( 2s \) ounces because it is twice the amount of salt.

According to the problem, the amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so we have:
\[ s = 2z \]

The total amount of ingredients used is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total amount of ingredients as:
\[ s + s + z + z + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 4s + 2z = 10 \]

Substituting \( s = 2z \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 4(2z) + 2z = 10 \]
\[ 8z + 2z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find \( s \):
\[ s = 2z = 2 \times 1 = 2 \]

The amount of oil used is \( 2s \):
\[ 2s = 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil used is 4 ounces.

"To find out how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows, then add these two amounts together.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John bought 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John bought 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the overall amount spent:
- Total cost of goats: $1500
- Total cost of cows: $3000
- Therefore, the total amount spent is \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:
4500"
"Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes for the party. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, which adds up to 48 cupcakes.

To find out how many more cupcakes Paul should buy, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number he needs:

63 (total needed) - 48 (already has) = 15

Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"First, let's determine how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. So, the number of cars he gives away is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of cars Joe has after selling and giving some away. He initially had 40 cars, sold 8, and gave away 16. Therefore, the number of cars Joe remains with is:

\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount raised by the students.
2. Divide this amount by the number of students.

First, we know the total amount raised for the charity is $175,000. Out of this, $50,000 comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to divide this amount by the number of students, which is 20:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\)."
"On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day, which is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) hours.

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is \( 8 + 4 = 12 \) hours.

To convert this total time into minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\( 12 \times 60 = 720 \) minutes.

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars entered, making the total:

50 + 20 = 70 cars

When he got out for lunch, half of the cars left the parking lot. So, the number of cars that left is:

70 / 2 = 35 cars

Therefore, the total number of cars left in the parking lot during lunch break is:

70 - 35 = 35 cars

The total number of cars he counted during lunch break is 35."
"To calculate how much John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tasks John does in a day.
2. Calculate the total number of tasks John does in a week.
3. Calculate the total earnings based on the number of tasks and the pay per task.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of tasks per day.
John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 tasks.
So, the total number of tasks per day is \(30 \times 5 = 150\).

Step 2: Calculate the total number of tasks per week.
Since John works 7 days a week, the total number of tasks per week is \(150 \times 7 = 1050\).

Step 3: Calculate the total earnings.
Each task pays $1.20, so the total earnings for the week are \(1050 \times 1.20 = 1260\).

Therefore, John makes \(\$1260\) in a full 7-day week."
"In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. However, we are asked for the total points Sasha scored, not Julie's.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add the points from both games together: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

Total points Sasha scored during both games: 18."

First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food:
- Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food.
- Each package contains 11 tins.
- Therefore, the total number of tins of cat food is \(8 \times 11 = 88\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food:
- Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food.
- Each package contains 6 tins.
- Therefore, the total number of tins of dog food is \(6 \times 6 = 36\).

- The difference is \(88 - 36 = 52\).

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food."
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have:
\[ \text{Smendrick's cards} = 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \]
\[ \text{Becca's cards} = 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards."
"To find out how many eggs Cindy had altogether, let's break down the information given:

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.
3. She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs:

- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

Total number of eggs = \(5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27\)

Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the refund she will receive and the cost of shipping the book back. Then, we'll subtract the refund from the original cost of the book to find the net loss.

1. **Calculate the refund:**
   - The book's purchase price is $32.
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price.
   - Refund = $32 * 0.75 = $24.

2. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds.
   - The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
   - Shipping cost for weight = 4 * $0.35 = $1.40.
   - The book needs to be returned 20 miles away.
   - The shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
   - Shipping cost for distance = 20 * $0.08 = $1.60.
   - Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - Original cost of the book = $32.
   - Refund = $24.
   - Net loss = Original cost - Refund - Shipping cost = $32 - $24 - $3 = $5.

Milly will lose $5."
"Mulan starts with $40 and her father gives her an additional $100, so she has:

\[ 40 + 100 = 140 \]

She then buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, which costs:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

And she buys a bag for $20. The total cost of her purchases is:

\[ 60 + 20 = 80 \]

So, Mulan has $60 left."
"To determine how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the production for the first three weeks and then find out how much is left for the fourth week.

1. First week production: 8,000 bars
2. Second week production: Half of the first week, which is \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars
3. Third week production: Three times the first week, which is \( 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \) bars

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars} \]

Boris produces a total of 50,000 bars each month. So, the production for the fourth week is the total monthly production minus the production of the first three weeks:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars} \]

Therefore, the production for the fourth week is 14,000 bars."
"To determine how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks, we need to calculate the time she spends on each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Time spent recording videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week, and each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Weekly recording time = 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes.
   - Monthly recording time = 72 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 288 minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Weekly writing time = 2 hours = 120 minutes.
   - Monthly writing time = 120 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 480 minutes.

3. **Time spent doing makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - Weekly makeup time = 15 minutes/day * 6 days = 90 minutes.
   - Monthly makeup time = 90 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 360 minutes.

Now, we sum up all the time spent on these activities in a month:

- Total monthly time = Recording time + Writing time + Makeup time
- Total monthly time = 288 minutes + 480 minutes + 360 minutes = 1128 minutes.

Therefore, Britany spends 1128 minutes on TikTok in a month with four weeks."
"To calculate the total cost for Angela, we need to break down the charges based on the information provided.

1. **Base Installation Cost**: The base cost for hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures is $129.00.

2. **Additional Items**:
   - Angela needs 6 mirrors, but the base cost already includes 4 mirrors. So, she needs 2 additional mirrors.
   - She needs 2 chandeliers, but the base cost already includes 1 chandelier. So, she needs 1 additional chandelier.
   - She needs 20 pictures, but the base cost already includes 10 pictures. So, she needs 10 additional pictures.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - Cost for 2 additional mirrors: 2 * $15.00 = $30.00
   - Cost for 1 additional chandelier: 1 * $15.00 = $15.00
   - Cost for 10 additional pictures: 10 * $15.00 = $150.00

4. **Total Additional Cost**: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

5. **Total Cost**: Base installation cost + Total additional cost = $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00

**Final Answer:**
The total cost for Angela will be $324.00."
"To find out how much money Roy has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Anthony has saved.
2. Use Anthony's savings to find out how much Roy has saved.

First, we know that Eva has saved $20.00. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so:

\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Next, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings:

\[ 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \]

So, Roy's savings are:

\[ \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 12 = 30 + 12 = 42 \]

Therefore, Roy has saved:

\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to work through the relationships step by step.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches high.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 48 inches high (12 inches * 4).
4. Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 480 inches high (48 inches * 10).

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 480 inches to feet by dividing by 12:

\[ \frac{480 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high."
"Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour. 

For the first part of his journey, he travels for 4 hours. The distance covered in this part is:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

After resting, he travels for another 6 hours. The distance covered in this part is:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the distances from both parts of his journey gives the total distance:
\[ 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for four turtles to travel the same distance that three kangaroos travel in 18 hours, given that each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo.

First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos. If three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel a certain distance, then the speed of the kangaroos can be represented as the distance divided by the time. Let's denote the distance as \(D\) and the speed of one kangaroo as \(S\). The total speed of the three kangaroos combined is \(3S\).

The distance \(D\) can be calculated as:
\[ D = 3S \times 18 \]

Now, let's consider the speed of the turtles. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{S}{2} \). The total speed of four turtles is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{S}{2} = 2S \]

We need to find the time \(T\) it takes for the four turtles to travel the same distance \(D\). Using the formula \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \), we can write:
\[ D = 2S \times T \]

We already know that \(D = 3S \times 18\), so we can set these two expressions for \(D\) equal to each other:
\[ 3S \times 18 = 2S \times T \]

We can cancel \(S\) from both sides of the equation (assuming \(S \neq 0\)):
\[ 3 \times 18 = 2T \]
\[ 54 = 2T \]
\[ T = \frac{54}{2} \]
\[ T = 27 \]

So, it will take the four turtles 27 hours to travel the same distance. 

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Kora made 20 dishes.
2. Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made \(20 + 20 = 40\) dishes.
3. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made \(2 \times 40 = 80\) dishes.

Now, to find the total number of dishes they all made together, we add the number of dishes each person made:

- Kora: 20 dishes
- Rory: 40 dishes
- Jada: 80 dishes

Total number of dishes = \(20 + 40 + 80 = 140\)

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes they all make together is 140."
"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the reduced price of the laptop after the trade-in.
2. Determine the total amount of money Erika has, excluding the money in her purse.
3. Subtract the total amount of money Erika has (excluding the purse) from the reduced price of the laptop to find out how much she has in her purse.

Step 1: The reduced price of the laptop after the trade-in is $600 - $200 = $400.

Step 2: Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom has given her $80. So, the total amount of money she has, excluding the money in her purse, is $150 + $80 = $230.

Step 3: Since Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, the amount of money she has in her purse is the reduced price of the laptop minus the total amount of money she has (excluding the purse) minus the extra $50 she needs. 

So, the amount in her purse is $400 - $230 - $50 = $120.

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse."
"To determine how many apple slices are left, we first need to calculate the total number of slices Adam has after slicing the apples.

Adam slices 3 large apples, and each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces. Therefore, the total number of slices from the large apples is:
\[ 3 \text{ large apples} \times 5 \text{ slices per large apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Next, Adam slices 5 small apples, and each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces. Therefore, the total number of slices from the small apples is:
\[ 5 \text{ small apples} \times 3 \text{ slices per small apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Adding the slices from the large and small apples together, we get the total number of slices:
\[ 15 \text{ slices from large apples} + 15 \text{ slices from small apples} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam then eats 15 slices. To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the number of slices he ate from the total number of slices:
\[ 30 \text{ slices} - 15 \text{ slices eaten} = 15 \text{ slices left} \]

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is:
\[ 15 \]"
"The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk a day from one cow. Therefore, with 3 cows, he extracts:

\[ 5 \, \text{liters/cow} \times 3 \, \text{cows} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, he needs:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed is:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and then sum these lengths.

1. The first glue stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left, so \( \frac{5}{6} \) is not used. Since the original length is 12 millimeters, the unused length is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left, so \( \frac{1}{3} \) is not used. The unused length is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left, so \( \frac{1}{2} \) is not used. The unused length is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Adding these unused lengths together:
\[
10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \text{ millimeters}

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 millimeters."
"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the car and the phone, and then subtract the amount of money he already has.

The total cost of the car and the phone is:
$10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800

Gabriel has:
$5000 (from working on weekends) + $200 (from his brother) = $5200

Now, we subtract the amount Gabriel has from the total cost:
$10800 (total cost) - $5200 (amount Gabriel has) = $5600

Gabriel still needs $5600."
"Thea gave the craftsman four $20 bills, which totals to:

4 * $20 = $80

The hat cost $70, so the change Thea received is:

$80 - $70 = $10

Therefore, Thea got $10 in change."
"Craig starts with 2 twenty dollar bills, which amounts to:

2 * $20 = $40

He spends $2 on each of the six squirt guns, so the total spent on squirt guns is:

6 * $2 = $12

He also spends $3 on each of the three packs of water balloons, so the total spent on water balloons is:

3 * $3 = $9

The total amount spent is the sum of the money spent on squirt guns and water balloons:

$12 + $9 = $21

To find out how much money Craig has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money he had:

$40 - $21 = $19

Therefore, Craig has $19 left."
"Given:
- Jack collected 60 dishes.
- Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) socks.
- Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
- Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
- Jack's total: \( 30 \) socks + \( 60 \) dishes = \( 90 \)
- Peter's total: \( 60 \) socks + \( 30 \) dishes = \( 90 \)

Together, they have \( 90 + 90 = 180 \).

"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

- There are 5 students who are good at math only.
- There are 8 students who perform well in English only.
- The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are not good at both subjects:
5 (math only) + 8 (English only) = 13 students

Since there are 20 students in total, the number of students who are good at both subjects is:
20 (total students) - 13 (neither math only nor English only) = 7 students

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math (both math only and both math and English):
5 (math only) + 7 (both) = 12 students

Therefore, the number of students who are good at math is 12.

"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years with simple interest, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the annual interest rate.
2. Calculate the interest earned each year.
3. Sum the interest earned over the 3 years and add it to the original investment.

The annual interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is $300. So, the annual interest rate is:

\[ \text{Annual Interest} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \]

Since the interest is simple, it is the same each year. Over 3 years, the total interest earned will be:

\[ \text{Total Interest} = 225 \times 3 = 675 \]

Now, we add the total interest to the original investment to find the total amount after 3 years:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $975."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **White Shirts with Collars:**
   - The store has 40 white shirts.
   - Half of the white shirts have collars.
   - Therefore, the number of white shirts with collars is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).

2. **White Shirts with No Collars:**
   - Since there are 40 white shirts in total and 20 have collars, the number of white shirts with no collars is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

3. **Floral Shirts with Buttons:**
   - The store has 50 floral shirts.
   - 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.

4. **Floral Shirts with No Buttons:**
   - Since there are 50 floral shirts in total and 20 have buttons, the number of floral shirts with no buttons is \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

5. **Difference Between Floral Shirts with No Buttons and White Shirts with No Collars:**
   - We need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars.
   - The number of floral shirts with no buttons is 30.
   - The number of white shirts with no collars is 20.
   - The difference is \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

Therefore, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars."
"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we first need to determine how many trays he can fill with 900 eggs, given that each tray holds 30 eggs. 

\[ \text{Number of trays} = \frac{\text{Total number of eggs}}{\text{Number of eggs per tray}} = \frac{900}{30} = 30 \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray.

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of trays} \times \text{Price per tray} = 30 \times 2.5 = 75 \]

Therefore, the farmer will earn $75."
"Mr. Smith initially has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y.

From Farm X, he sold 10 goats, so the number of goats left in Farm X is:
55 - 10 = 45 goats

From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as he did from Farm X, which means he sold:
2 * 10 = 20 goats

So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
45 - 20 = 25 goats

Altogether, the number of goats left in the two farms is:
45 (from Farm X) + 25 (from Farm Y) = 70 goats

So, on average, James pays $110 for each pair of shoes."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food.
2. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food, taking into account the $2 discount for each basket.
3. Add the two amounts to find the total cost.

Step 1: Cost of 3 baskets of green food
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- Therefore, 3 baskets of green food cost \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

Step 2: Cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount
- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- With a $2 discount for each basket, the cost per basket of red food is \(18 - 2 = 16\) dollars.
- Therefore, 3 baskets of red food cost \(3 \times 16 = 48\) dollars.

Step 3: Total cost
- The total cost is the sum of the cost of the green food and the red food.
- Total cost = \(75 + 48 = 123\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount you will have to pay is $123."

"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.
2. Determine how many packs are required to meet this need, considering he can only buy whole packs and wants to have some extra glue sticks.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.
- There are 27 students.
- Each student needs 2 glue sticks.
- Total glue sticks needed = 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks.

Step 2: Determine how many packs are required.
- Glue sticks come in packs of 8.
- To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack and round up to the nearest whole number because he can only buy whole packs and wants to have some extra glue sticks.
- 54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs.
- Since he can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number, which is 7 packs.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks."
"On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

"Claire earns 1 badge every month. In a year, which has 12 months, Claire will earn:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so in the same 12 months, Amber will earn:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ badges}}{2} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so in 12 months, Wendy will earn:
\[ 12 \text{ badges} \times 3 = 36 \text{ badges} \]

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1 year time frame, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:
\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame."
"Paige bakes from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 banana bread loaves every hour, in 5 hours she bakes:

"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students.
2. Add the number of burritos Mr. George ate to the total consumed by the students.
3. Subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students.
- There are 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos.
- Total burritos for students = 50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos.

Step 2: Add the number of burritos Mr. George ate.
- Mr. George ate 20 burritos.
- Total burritos consumed = 500 burritos (students) + 20 burritos (Mr. George) = 520 burritos.

Step 3: Subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered.
- Initial number of burritos ordered = 600 burritos.
- Total burritos consumed = 520 burritos.
- Total leftover burritos = 600 burritos - 520 burritos = 80 burritos.

The total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 80."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Red Cars**: There are 12 red cars.
2. **Green Cars**: There are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is \(12 - 2 = 10\).
3. **Blue Cars**: There are 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Now, let's add up the number of red, green, and blue cars:
\[12 \text{ (red)} + 10 \text{ (green)} + 30 \text{ (blue)} = 52\]

The total number of cars in the rink is 75. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:
\[75 - 52 = 23\]

Therefore, the number of yellow cars is 23."
"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as \( F \), Anne has as \( A \), and Sofie has as \( S \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \)
2. \( S = A + 25 \)
3. \( A = F - 12 \)

First, we can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation to find \( F \).

From the third equation, we can express \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ A = F - 12 \]

From the second equation, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( A \):
\[ S = A + 25 \]
Substituting \( A = F - 12 \) into this equation, we get:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \]

Now, we substitute \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \( 28 \) books.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{28} \]"

\[ 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots."
"To determine how much Greg will spend on jello, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.
2. Determine how many boxes of jello are required.
3. Calculate the total cost.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.**

Greg wants each of the 30 kids to have 4 jello cups. Therefore, the total number of jello cups needed is:
\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups per kid} = 120 \text{ cups} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many boxes of jello are required.**

Each box makes 10 small jello cups. To find out how many boxes are needed to make 120 cups, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups per box:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost.**

Each box of jello costs $1.25. Therefore, the total cost for 12 boxes is:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

**Final Answer:**
\[ \$15.00 \]"
"To find out how much change the seller will give back, we first need to calculate the total cost of the 5 phones.

\[ 5 \times 700 = 3500 \]

The seller gives $4000. To find the change, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given:
\[ 4000 - 3500 = 500 \]

So, the seller will give back $500 in change."
"To determine how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to calculate the total amount each person pays per month and then divide that by 4 to find the weekly amount.

1. Calculate the total amount Madeline pays per month:
   - Madeline pays 60% of the total cost.
   - Total cost per month = $400.
   - Madeline's monthly payment = 60% of $400 = 0.60 * $400 = $240.

2. Calculate the total amount Keenan pays per month:
   - Since the total cost is $400 and Madeline pays $240, Keenan pays the remaining amount.
   - Keenan's monthly payment = Total cost - Madeline's payment = $400 - $240 = $160.

3. Calculate the amount Keenan spends per week:
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Keenan's weekly payment = Keenan's monthly payment / 4 = $160 / 4 = $40.

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total pieces of pizza**: 60

2. **Pieces eaten on the first day**: \( \frac{2}{5} \) of 60
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24
   \]
   So, Tobias ate 24 pieces on the first day.

3. **Remaining pieces after the first day**: 
   \[
   60 - 24 = 36
   \]

4. **Pieces eaten on the second day**: 10 pieces
   \[

   So, 26 pieces remain after the second day.

5. **Pieces eaten on the third day**: \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining 26 pieces
   \[
   \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14
   \]
   So, Tobias ate 14 pieces on the third day.

6. **Total pieces eaten so far**: 
   \[
   24 + 10 + 14 = 48
   \]

Therefore, Tobias has eaten 48 pieces of pizza so far."
"To find out how much David will spend on 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we first need to determine the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water.

Given:
- 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00

"To determine how much Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the profit to find the cost price of the chickens.

Step 1: Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
Isaias has 300 chickens and plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of them.
\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = 300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180 \]

Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
The selling price per chicken is $50.
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Step 3: Use the profit to find the cost price of the chickens.
Isaias makes a profit of $2000.
\[ \text{Total cost price} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Profit} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for a total of $7000."
"Julie sold 14 glasses of lemonade. The total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32. Since the boys (Micah and Mitchell) sold an equal number of glasses, we can find out how many glasses Micah sold by first determining how many glasses the boys sold in total.

The total number of glasses sold by Julie and the boys is 32. Subtracting the 14 glasses sold by Julie, we get:
32 - 14 = 18 glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell together.

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses by 2 to find out how many glasses each of them sold:
18 / 2 = 9 glasses sold by Micah.

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold:
14 - 9 = 5.

Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"To solve this problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age.

If in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old, we can calculate her current age as follows:
\[ \text{Current age} = 18 - 10 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Let's denote the number of years from now when this will happen as \( x \).

In \( x \) years, Melanie's age will be \( 8 + x \). According to the problem, at that time, her age will be three times her current age, which is \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \).

So, we set up the equation:
\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of Bacon:**
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.
   - Cost per pack of bacon = $10 / 5 = $2.

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Cost per packet of chicken = 2 * $2 = $4.
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   - Total cost of chicken = 6 * $4 = $24.

3. **Cost of Strawberries:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries.
   - Total cost of strawberries = 3 * $4 = $12.

4. **Cost of Apples:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Cost per pack of apples = $4 / 2 = $2.
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples.
   - Total cost of apples = 7 * $2 = $14.

5. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost of all items = Cost of bacon + Cost of chicken + Cost of strawberries + Cost of apples.
   - Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

6. **Remaining Budget:**

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes.

"The Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. On Fridays, they make twice as many as on a Tuesday, which means they make 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas on Fridays.

To find the total number of chimichangas made on these three days, we add the number of chimichangas made each day:

125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday) = 500 chimichangas.

Therefore, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"First, we need to determine how many microphones will not find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. Given that 20% of the 50 microphones won't fit, we calculate:

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 microphones

This means 10 microphones will not be paired. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be paired is:

50 - 10 = 40 microphones

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:

40 / 2 = 20 pairs

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage."

"To find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we first need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower.

For the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the orchids is \(5 \times 5 = 25\).

For the African daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the daisies is \(4 \times 10 = 40\).

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of orchid petals from the total number of daisy petals:
- The difference in the number of petals is \(40 - 25 = 15\).

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids."
"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants:

\[ \text{Outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. To find the number of flowering plants, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, 25% of the plants are flowering plants."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed of a whirligig based on the given information about the speeds of a thingamabob and a whatchamacallit.

1. Let's denote the speed of a thingamabob as \( v \) meters per second.
2. According to the problem, a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a whatchamacallit is \( 11v \) meters per second.
3. We are given that the speed of a whatchamacallit is 121 meters per second. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   11v = 121
   \]
4. Solving for \( v \):
   \[
   v = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second}

Mark makes $480 a week."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( J \).
2. According to the problem, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
3. In the following week, Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.
4. Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work each week. Therefore, the total amount Tasha earned from mowing Joe's lawn over the two weeks is \( 6J + 6J = 12J \).
5. The total earnings from mowing lawns and selling lemonade last month were $80. Let's denote the earnings from selling lemonade as \( L \). Therefore, we have the equation:
   \[
   12J + L = 80
   \]
6. We need to find the value of \( J \) to solve for \( L \). However, the problem does not provide the exact amount Joe paid for each lawn mowing session, so we can't determine \( J \) directly. But we can express \( L \) in terms of \( J \):
   \[
   L = 80 - 12J
   \]
7. Since the problem does not give us the exact value of \( J \), we can't determine the exact numerical value of \( L \) without additional information. However, the problem asks for the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales, and we can express it as:
   \[
   L = 80 - 12J
   \]
8. Without the exact value of \( J \), we can't simplify this further. But if we assume the problem is solvable with the given information, we can infer that the problem might be designed such that \( J \) is an integer that makes \( L \) a non-negative integer. Given the constraints, let's assume the simplest case where \( J = 5 \) (a reasonable assumption based on typical lawn mowing rates and the need for \( L \) to be a non-negative integer):
   \[
   L = 80 - 12 \times 5 = 80 - 60 = 20
   \]

Therefore, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"Dijana rowed for 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, which means Anis rowed an additional \(50 \times \frac{1}{5} = 10\) miles. Therefore, Anis rowed \(50 + 10 = 60\) miles.

The total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis is \(50 + 60 = 110\) miles.

110 miles"
"Susan originally made 100 cookies. Her husband snuck 4 cookies for himself, leaving 100 - 4 = 96 cookies.

Now, these 96 cookies are to be equally divided among her 6 nephews.

To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of nephews:

96 cookies ÷ 6 nephews = 16 cookies per nephew.

Each of Susan’s nephews will get 16 cookies."
"Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages.

Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today.

So, the total number of pages Denise read is 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.

Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and 0 pages today, so he read a total of 13 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages Daniel read from the total pages Denise read:

28 (Denise's total) - 13 (Daniel's total) = 15 pages.

Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the total amount of soup Calvin has in terms of bowls.

Calvin's pot can fill:
- 4 adult bowls
- 8 child bowls

Since Calvin and his wife are both adults, they will each have 1 adult bowl, which totals 2 adult bowls for the adults. This leaves us with 2 adult bowls worth of soup for the children.

Each child's bowl is half the size of an adult's bowl, so 2 adult bowls are equivalent to 4 child bowls (since 2 adult bowls * 2 child bowls/adult bowl = 4 child bowls).

Calvin has 8 child bowls in total, and after the adults have their bowls, there are 4 child bowls left. Since there are 2 children, we divide the leftover soup equally between them.

4 child bowls / 2 children = 2 child bowls per child

So, each child will be able to have 2 bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

Each child will be able to have 2 bowls of soup for lunch."
"William bought five notebooks at $1.50 each and one ballpen at $0.50.

The cost for the notebooks is:
5 notebooks * $1.50/notebook = $7.50

The cost for the ballpen is:
1 ballpen * $0.50/ballpen = $0.50

The total amount spent is:
$7.50 + $0.50 = $8.00

He spent a total of $8.00."
"To determine how much material Jo would need to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can calculate the material required for each type of mask separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the material needed for 20 small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 small mask, she needs \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards of material.
- For 20 small masks, she would need \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards of material.

Next, let's calculate the material needed for 8 large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 large mask, she needs \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards of material.
- For 8 large masks, she would need \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards of material.

Now, we add the material needed for the small and large masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

Therefore, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tickets Deepa has seen.
2. Divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets to find the average price per ticket.

First, we know that there are 9 Fast and the Furious movies and Deepa has seen each one 3 times. So, the total number of tickets she has seen is:

\[ 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ tickets} \]

Next, we know that she has spent $216 in total. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

\[ \frac{216 \text{ dollars}}{27 \text{ tickets}} = 8 \text{ dollars per ticket} \]

So, the average price she paid per ticket is $8."
"To determine Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his activities and subtract that from the total hours in a day.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up the time spent on these activities:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Walk: 1 hour

Total time spent on activities = 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours

There are 24 hours in a day. To find the free time, we subtract the total time spent on activities from the total hours in a day:
24 - 19 = 5 hours

Therefore, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day."
"Tim starts with 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes.

He uses 3 blue shoe boxes for fishing, so the number of blue shoe boxes left is:
7 - 3 = 4 blue shoe boxes.

He uses 1/3 of his red shoe boxes for fishing, so the number of red shoe boxes used is:
1/3 * 9 = 3 red shoe boxes.

Therefore, the number of red shoe boxes left is:
9 - 3 = 6 red shoe boxes.

So, the total number of shoe boxes left in Tim's box is:
4 blue + 6 red = 10 shoe boxes.

Final numerical answer:
10 shoe boxes."
"Sarah has 9 books. Joseph had twice the number of Sarah's books, so Joseph originally had \(9 \times 2 = 18\) books. Joseph lost 2 of them, so he currently has \(18 - 2 = 16\) books.

Joseph currently has 16 books."
"Dean starts with 30 marbles.

First, he gives 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie:
1/5 of 30 = 30 / 5 = 6 marbles.

After giving 6 marbles to Jamie, Dean has:
30 - 6 = 24 marbles left.

Then, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald:
24 - 10 = 14 marbles.

So, the final number of marbles left for Dean is 14."
"To solve this problem, let's first set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( D \) be Duncan's current age and \( A \) be Adam's current age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).
2. Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago.

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 \), and four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).

So, the equation based on the given information is:
\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam is currently 30 years old.

To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years."
"Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. So, we calculate twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm first:

2 * 200 acres = 400 acres

Then, we add 100 acres to this amount:

400 acres + 100 acres = 500 acres

So, Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres.

Now, to find the total number of acres for both farms together, we add the sizes of both farms:

200 acres + 500 acres = 700 acres

The two farms together have 700 acres."
"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, we calculate:

50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. We multiply the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours in a workday:

40 packages/hour * 8 hours = 320 packages

Now, we calculate how much money he earns. He gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes. So, we multiply the number of packages by the payment per package:

320 packages * $0.20/package = $64.00

Therefore, Colby earns $64.00 in a typical eight-hour workday."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle:**
   - A normal sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes.
   - An extreme sudoku puzzle takes 4 times that long, so:
     \[
     45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Calculate how many bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes:**
   - John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, which is 30 minutes.
   - To find out how many 30-minute intervals are in 180 minutes, we divide 180 by 30:
     \[
     \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes per bottle}} = 6 \text{ bottles}
     \]

Therefore, John drinks 6 bottles of water in the time it takes him to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle.

**Final numerical answer:**

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as \( y \).

From the problem, we know:
- Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
- Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
- There are 20 red balloons.

First, we calculate the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons:
\[ 20 \text{ red balloons} \times 2 \text{ pieces per red balloon} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we know the total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58, so the number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons is:
\[ 58 \text{ total pieces} - 40 \text{ pieces for red balloons} = 18 \text{ pieces} \]

Since each yellow balloon receives 3 pieces of bologna, we can find the number of yellow balloons by dividing the total bologna pieces for yellow balloons by the number of pieces per yellow balloon:
\[ y = \frac{18 \text{ pieces}}{3 \text{ pieces per yellow balloon}} = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of yellow balloons is 6.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, which totals:

100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the interval for a tune-up:

3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time."
"On Tuesday, Bruce works for 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which is \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

To find the total number of hours Bruce works over these three days, we add the hours from each day together:

\(5 + 10 + 8 = 23\)

Bruce works a total of 23 hours in all these three days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: Since 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons would be:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each would cost:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to cover these expenses, the total amount they had together is $28. Since they had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total by 2 to find out how much each girl received:
\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14."
"Kira initially bought a total of 3 apples + 5 bananas + 6 oranges = 14 pieces of fruit.

"To find the total number of students, we need to add the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer.

1. There are 6 students playing tennis.
2. There are twice that number playing volleyball, which means there are \(6 \times 2 = 12\) students playing volleyball.
3. There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so the total number of students playing soccer is \(16 + 22 = 38\).

Now, we add the numbers together:
\[6 + 12 + 38 = 56\]

Therefore, the total number of students is 56."
"To calculate the profit made from selling lollipops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Step 1: Total number of lollipops sold
- Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops.
- Total lollipops sold = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student = 300 lollipops.

Step 2: Total revenue from selling the lollipops
- Each lollipop was sold for $0.8.
- Total revenue = 300 lollipops * $0.8/lollypop = $240.

Step 3: Total cost of buying the lollipops
- Each lollipop was bought for $0.5.
- Total cost = 300 lollipops * $0.5/lollypop = $150.

Step 4: Calculate the profit
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $240 - $150 = $90.

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To find out how many pets Larry has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and then sum them up.

1. **Cats**: Larry has 3 cats.
2. **Dogs**: He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. **Rabbits**: He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. **Fish**: He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(7 \times 3 = 21\) fish.
5. **Gerbils**: He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) gerbils.

Now, we sum up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\).

Therefore, Larry has 47 pets."
"Abby eats 2 slices of bread per day. Josh eats twice as much as Abby, which means Josh eats 4 slices of bread per day.

Together, Abby and Josh eat \(2 + 4 = 6\) slices of bread per day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices.

To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat per day:

\[
\frac{24 \text{ slices}}{6 \text{ slices/day}} = 4 \text{ days}
\]

The loaf of bread will last for 4 days."
"Martha started collecting shells when she was 5 years old and continued until her 10th birthday. This means she collected shells for 10 - 5 = 5 years. Since she collects one shell every month, we need to calculate the total number of months in 5 years.

"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to calculate the number of trips the sloth can make in that time and then divide the total number of berries by the number of trips.

1. The sloth takes 4 hours for one round trip (down, pick berries, and back up).
2. In 8 hours, the sloth can make \( \frac{8}{4} = 2 \) round trips.
3. If the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, and he makes 2 round trips, then he needs to pick \( \frac{24}{2} = 12 \) berries per round trip.

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground is 12."
"First, we need to determine how much water is in the tank after Anthony and his father fill it. The tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10,000 gallons of water. Therefore, the tank is filled with:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water is left in the tank after 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. Over 6 days, the total amount of water emptied from the tank is:

\[ 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Subtracting this from the initial amount of water in the tank gives us the remaining amount of water:

\[ 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, after 6 days, the tank will have:

\[ \boxed{2000} \text{ gallons of water remaining} \]"
"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the expenses he has already made and the expenses for the current day.

1. **Initial Monthly Budget**: $150
2. **Expenses so far**:
   - **Movies**: 5 (Fridays or Saturdays) + 8 (other days) = 13 movies
     - Cost per movie on Fridays or Saturdays: $10
     - Cost per movie on other days: $7
     - Total cost for 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
     - Total cost for 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
     - Total cost for 13 movies: $50 + $56 = $106
   - **Popcorn**: 2 tubs at $8 each
     - Total cost for popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
   - **Candy**: 4 boxes at $2 each
     - Total cost for candy: 4 * $2 = $8
   - **Total expenses so far**: $106 + $16 + $8 = $130

3. **Remaining Budget**: $150 - $130 = $20

4. **Current Day Expenses**:
   - **Movie**: It's a Friday, so the ticket costs $10.
   - **Popcorn**: $8
   - **Candy**: $2
   - **Total for current day**: $10 + $8 + $2 = $20

5. **Remaining Budget After Current Day Expenses**: $20 - $20 = $0

Since Colby's remaining budget is exactly $0 after accounting for the current day's expenses, he cannot see any more movies.

"To find the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the calories in one mini cinnamon roll.
2. Calculate the total calories for all mini cinnamon rolls.
3. Calculate the calories in one mini blueberry muffin.
4. Calculate the total calories for all mini blueberry muffins.
5. Add the total calories from both types of pastries to get the final answer.

Step 1: A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. Since a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, the calories in one mini cinnamon roll are:
\[ \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Step 2: Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls. The total calories for all mini cinnamon rolls are:
\[ 200 \times 200 = 40,000 \text{ calories} \]

Step 3: A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. Since a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, the calories in one mini blueberry muffin are:
\[ \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories} \]

Step 4: Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins. The total calories for all mini blueberry muffins are:
\[ 300 \times 150 = 45,000 \text{ calories} \]

Step 5: The total calories for all the pastries are:
\[ 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 \text{ calories} \]

Therefore, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is:
\[ 85,000 \text{ calories} \]"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the week and then divide by the number of days.

1. On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
2. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, so that's \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs each day.
3. On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
4. On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's sum up the total number of Junebugs removed:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Adding these together:

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we need to find the average number of Junebugs removed per day. There are 5 days in the week (Monday through Friday), so we divide the total by 5:

\[
\frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

For the bus:
- Speed = 60 miles per hour
- Time = 5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

For the car:
- Speed = 30 miles per hour
- Time = 8 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, to find out how much farther the bus went than the car:
- Difference in distance = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of all the other toys and then subtract that total from the overall number of toys Sophie has.

The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
The tower of stacking rings has 9 rings.

Adding these together:
31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

Sophie has a total of 62 toys.

To find the number of bouncy balls, we subtract the total number of other toys from the overall total:
62 (total toys) - 48 (other toys) = 14

So, the tube of bouncy balls contains 14 bouncy balls.

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: \( P + Pa + J = 100 \).
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: \( Pa = J + 10 \).
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: \( P = Pa + J \).

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we have \( J \), we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is \( 50 \) years.

Final numerical answer:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Maria invited 4 friends, so there are 4 + 1 (Maria) = 5 people in total.
2. Maria gave each of her friends 2 water balloons, so that's 4 friends * 2 balloons = 8 balloons.
3. Maria had 1 water balloon for herself.
4. Then, her mom gave each person 3 more balloons, so that's 5 people * 3 balloons = 15 balloons.

Now, let's add up all the balloons:
- Initial balloons given by Maria: 8 + 1 (for herself) = 9 balloons.
- Additional balloons given by her mom: 15 balloons.

Total balloons = 9 + 15 = 24 balloons.

The girls had a total of 24 balloons."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated and already owned by the charity group.

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so the total number of donated boxes is:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

Adding the 10 boxes they already have:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Each table can fit 2 boxes worth of stuff. To find out how many tables are needed in total, we divide the total number of boxes by the number of boxes each table can hold:
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

The charity group already owns 15 tables. To find out how many new tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they already have from the total number of tables needed:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ new tables} \]

Therefore, the charity group needs 15 new tables."
"To find the average total distance spat, we first need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then find the average of these totals.

"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine over a month, then find the revenue from selling those widgets, and finally, find the difference in revenue.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month:

1. **Widgeteer 3000:**
   - Widgets per hour: 60
   - Hours per day: 24
   - Days in a month: 30
   - Total widgets in a month = 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets

2. **WidgetMaster 9000:**
   - Widgets per hour: 45
   - Hours per day: 24
   - Days in a month: 30
   - Total widgets in a month = 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Next, we calculate the revenue from selling these widgets at $6 each:

1. **Revenue from Widgeteer 3000:**
   - Total widgets = 43,200
   - Price per widget = $6
   - Total revenue = 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

2. **Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000:**
   - Total widgets = 32,400
   - Price per widget = $6
   - Total revenue = 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

Finally, we find the difference in revenue:

- Difference in revenue = Revenue from Widgeteer 3000 - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000
- Difference in revenue = $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

Therefore, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. This means he will stay for a total of 17 hours.

The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos. For the additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5), he will pay 70 pesos per hour.

The cost for the additional 5 hours is:
5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

So, the total cost for Cameron is:
1000 pesos (for the first 12 hours) + 350 pesos (for the additional 5 hours) = 1350 pesos

If Cameron had paid for a 24-hour stay, it would have cost 1600 pesos.

The amount Cameron would save by paying for the additional hours instead of a full 24-hour stay is:
1600 pesos (24-hour stay) - 1350 pesos (12-hour stay + additional hours) = 250 pesos

Cameron would save 250 pesos."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the hay requirement for each sheep:**
   - Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs.
   - Each goat needs 5 pounds.
   - Twice the amount each goat needs is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pounds.
   - Therefore, each sheep needs \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds of hay.

2. **Calculate the total hay needed for the goats:**
   - There are 15 goats.
   - Each goat needs 5 pounds.
   - Total hay for goats = \(15 \times 5 = 75\) pounds.

3. **Calculate the total hay needed for the sheep:**
   - There are 12 sheep.
   - Each sheep needs 7 pounds.
   - Total hay for sheep = \(12 \times 7 = 84\) pounds.

4. **Calculate the total hay needed for all the livestock:**
   - Total hay = hay for goats + hay for sheep
   - Total hay = \(75 + 84 = 159\) pounds.

Therefore, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay."
"First, let's calculate how much John earned in the week:

John earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the amount he spent on gas:
\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we subtract the amount he wants to deposit in the bank:
\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the 5 pencils:
\[ 5 \text{ pencils} \times 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we determine how many $25 pens he can buy with the remaining $100:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ dollars}}{25 \text{ dollars/pen}} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of letters Craig and his brother have spelled out after ten rounds.

First, let's calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled out:
- Craig has spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each.
- Therefore, the total number of letters Craig has spelled out is \(20 \times 15 = 300\).

Next, we need to find out how many letters Craig's brother has spelled out:
- Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig.
- Therefore, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled out is \(300 + 50 = 350\).

Finally, to find the total number of letters they've spelled out together, we add the number of letters Craig has spelled to the number of letters his brother has spelled:
- Total number of letters = \(300 + 350 = 650\).

Therefore, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 650."
"To find the total number of children in the drill, we need to calculate the number of children in one row and then multiply that by the total number of rows.

Each row has 8 children, and there are 7 rows per school. Since there are 5 different schools, the total number of rows is \(7 \times 5 = 35\).

Now, we multiply the number of children per row by the total number of rows:

\(8 \times 35 = 280\)

Therefore, the total number of children in the drill is 280."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming all her coupons. Since each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice and she has 9 coupons, the total number of bottles is:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself."
"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing job, we need to consider the following components:

1. The visit charge: $40
2. The labor charge: $35 per hour for 2.25 hours. Since the charge is per hour or part thereof, we round up 2.25 hours to 3 hours (as partial hours are charged as full hours). So, the labor charge is $35 * 3 = $105.
3. The parts charge: $60

Now, we add these components together:

$40 (visit charge) + $105 (labor charge) + $60 (parts charge) = $205

Therefore, Patty charged $205 for the job."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount:

10 CDs * $15/CD = $150

Now, let's apply the 40% discount:

40% of $150 = 0.40 * $150 = $60

So, the discounted price for the 10 CDs is:

$150 - $60 = $90

Next, we need to account for the 5 CDs that James decides he doesn't like and sells them for $40 each:

5 CDs * $40/CD = $200

Now, to find out how much money James was out, we subtract the money he got from selling the 5 CDs from the total discounted price:

$90 - $200 = -$110

Since the result is negative, it means James actually gained $110, not that he was out any money. However, the question asks how much money he was ""out,"" which implies a loss. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that he was not out any money, but rather gained $110.

Final numerical answer:
$110"
"To calculate how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to multiply the quantity of each type of root crop by its respective price and then sum up the totals.

1. For yams: \(6 \text{ yams} \times \$1.5 \text{ per yam} = \$9\)
2. For sweet potatoes: \(10 \text{ sweet potatoes} \times \$2 \text{ per sweet potato} = \$20\)
3. For carrots: \(4 \text{ carrots} \times \$1.25 \text{ per carrot} = \$5\)

Now, we add up the totals from each type of root crop:

\(\$9 + \$20 + \$5 = \$34\)

Therefore, if Jen sells everything, she will earn \(\$34\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. Calculate the distance James swims initially.
2. Determine the time it takes to swim that distance.
3. Calculate the rest time.
4. Determine the remaining distance.
5. Calculate the time to swim the remaining distance at the reduced speed.
6. Sum up all the times to get the total time.

Let's go through each step:

1. **Distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Time to swim the initial distance:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Rest time:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Remaining distance:**
   The remaining distance is the total distance minus the distance already swum.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Time to swim the remaining distance at the reduced speed:**
   James swims the remaining distance at half the original speed, which is 1 mile per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Total time:**
   Sum up all the times.
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours."

"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the commission from the New York Times.
2. Calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal.
3. Add the two amounts to get the total commission.

**Step 1: Commission from the New York Times**
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy of the New York Times.
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- He sells 6 copies.

The commission per copy of the New York Times is 10% of $5, which is \(0.10 \times 5 = 0.50\) dollars.

So, the total commission from the New York Times is \(6 \times 0.50 = 3\) dollars.

**Step 2: Commission from the Wall Street Journal**
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy of the Wall Street Journal.
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- He sells 10 copies.

The commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is 8% of $15, which is \(0.08 \times 15 = 1.20\) dollars.

So, the total commission from the Wall Street Journal is \(10 \times 1.20 = 12\) dollars.

**Step 3: Total Commission**
- The total commission is the sum of the commission from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.

Total commission = \(3 + 12 = 15\) dollars.

**Final Answer:**

"Deanna is 26 years old.

Since Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, Marcus is:
26 - 5 = 21 years old.

Marcus is also half of Leo’s age, so Leo’s age is:
21 * 2 = 42 years old.

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as B, A, and D respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. B + A + D = 45 (since the total points scored by the team is 45)
2. B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)
3. B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)

We can use the second and third equations to express A and D in terms of B:
- A = B - 20
- D = B - 10

Substituting these into the first equation:
B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45

Combining like terms:
3B - 30 = 45

Adding 30 to both sides:
3B = 75

Dividing by 3:
B = 25

Now, we can find A:
A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

Final numerical answer:

Given:
- The book is 1.5 inches thick.
- There are 100 pages per inch of paper.

To find the total number of pages in the book, we multiply the thickness of the book by the number of pages per inch:

\[ \text{Total pages} = 1.5 \, \text{inches} \times 100 \, \text{pages/inch} \]

\[ \text{Total pages} = 150 \, \text{pages} \]

So, the book has 150 pages."
"To determine how many reports Vince stapled, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Vince spent stapling.
2. Determine how many 15-minute intervals are in that total time.
3. Multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports he can staple in each interval.

First, let's find the total time Vince spent stapling. He started at 8:00 AM and stopped at 11:00 PM. The time from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we convert 15 hours into minutes:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
\[ \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince can staple 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Usual Sleep Duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - The total sleep duration is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours.
   - Converting 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Time Waking Up Earlier:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so her usual wake-up time of 6 a.m. is now 5:55 a.m.

3. **Sleepwalking Duration:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is \(2:38 - 2:15 = 23\) minutes.

4. **Time Spent Awake During Sleepwalking:**
   - Since she was sleepwalking, she was not asleep during this time.
   - Therefore, we need to subtract the 23 minutes of sleepwalking from her usual sleep duration.

5. **Total Sleep Duration on That Day:**
   - Usual sleep duration: 480 minutes
   - Subtract sleepwalking time: \(480 - 23 = 457\) minutes

Thus, Kim slept on her bed for 457 minutes that day."
"Jonathan has two dozen measuring cups, which is 24 cups.

Given that Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons he has initially:

\[
\text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16
\]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[
16 - 6 = 10
\]

Now, we add the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has:

\[
24 \text{ (cups)} + 10 \text{ (spoons)} = 34
\]

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 34."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Occupancy:**
   - The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds.
   - Initially, 1/5 of the beds are occupied.
   - Number of occupied beds = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.
   - Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds initially = \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) beds.

2. **Daily Admissions:**
   - 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new admissions = \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Initially, 200 beds are occupied.
   - After 2 weeks, 700 more beds are occupied.
   - Total occupied beds = \( 200 + 700 = 900 \) beds.

4. **Total Unoccupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - The hospital's total capacity is 1000 beds.
   - Total unoccupied beds = \( 1000 - 900 = 100 \) beds.

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the remainder is:

16 - 7 = 9 emails.

Two-thirds of these 9 emails are to family. So, the number of emails to family is:

(2/3) * 9 = 6 emails.

The remaining emails, which are not to family, are:

9 - 6 = 3 emails.

One-third of these remaining emails are to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails to her boyfriend is:

"If Courtney reported 48 people and Kelly said that Courtney had overstated the number by 20%, we can calculate the actual number of people who attended the concert.

Let's denote the actual number of people who attended the concert as \( x \).

According to Kelly, Courtney's number (48) is 120% of the actual number (since 100% + 20% = 120%). This can be expressed as:
\[ 48 = 1.20 \times x \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"To solve this problem, let's define the number of balls each boy carried in terms of Jeffrey's number of balls.

Let \( J \) represent the number of balls Jeffrey carried. According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by all three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each boy:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

Now, we can find the total number of balls:
\[ 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes by the end of the third day after filling in two holes.
3. Use the information that the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

Let's start with the first step:

- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes.

So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29 \]

By the end of the third day, they had 29 holes. According to the problem, by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes was four times the number of holes at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day was 10. Therefore, by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes was:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

The number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the number of holes at the end of the fourth day and the number of holes at the end of the third day:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \]

So, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:

"To find out how much Jen's travel costs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the tickets, which is 50% more than the supplies.
2. Add the cost of the supplies to the cost of the tickets to get the total travel cost.

First, let's calculate the cost of the tickets. The supplies cost $400, and the tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. So, we calculate 50% of $400:

\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the tickets is:

\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Now, we add the cost of the supplies to the cost of the tickets to get the total travel cost:

\[ 400 + 600 = 1000 \]

So, the total travel cost is $1000."
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( X + S + A = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, we can substitute the expression for \( X \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (S + 5) + S + A = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A = 334 \]

Next, we substitute the expression for \( S \) from the third equation into the equation above:
\[ 2(4A - 13) + A = 334 \]
\[ 8A - 26 + A = 334 \]
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we have \( A \), we can find \( S \):
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{147} \]"

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird flew in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction.

1. The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour:
   \[ 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

2. The bird then flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour:
   \[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \]

3. Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour:
   \[ 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \]

The total southward distance is the sum of the first and third segments:
\[ 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \]

The total northward distance is the second segment:
\[ 36 \text{ miles} \]

The net southward distance is the total southward distance minus the total northward distance:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[ 374 \text{ miles} \]"

2. At her office party, she received 1/2 dozen (6) brownies.
3. Her friends at home had 4 dozen (48) brownies waiting for her.
4. During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten.

Now, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had:

- Brownies made: 12
- Brownies received from office: 6
- Brownies received from friends: 48

Total brownies before the surprise party: \(12 + 6 + 48 = 66\)

During the surprise party, 18 brownies were eaten, so the number of brownies left is:

\(66 - 18 = 48\)

Therefore, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day."
"Nani is 8 years old.

His brother is twice Nani's age, so the brother is \(8 \times 2 = 16\) years old.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find 25% of Nani's age, we calculate \(8 \times 0.25 = 2\). So, the sister is \(8 - 2 = 6\) years old.

The total age of all three family members is \(8 + 16 + 6 = 30\).

"To determine the total time it will take Andy to restring all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of stringing and then sum these times.

1. For the 3 racquets strung with synthetic gut:
   - Time per racquet: 15 minutes
   - Total time: 3 * 15 = 45 minutes

2. For the 5 racquets strung with polyester string:
   - Time per racquet: 22 minutes
   - Total time: 5 * 22 = 110 minutes

3. For the 4 racquets strung with a hybrid set:
   - Time per racquet: 18 minutes
   - Total time: 4 * 18 = 72 minutes

Now, we add up all the times:
- Total time = 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes

Therefore, it will take Andy 227 minutes to restring all the racquets."
"John is buying phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which makes a total of 4 phones.

The first 2 phones are at full price, which is $600 each. So, the cost for the first 2 phones is:
2 phones * $600/phone = $1200

The remaining 2 phones are at half price, which is $600 / 2 = $300 each. So, the cost for the last 2 phones is:
2 phones * $300/phone = $600

Adding the cost of the first 2 phones and the last 2 phones together gives the total cost:
$1200 + $600 = $1800

Therefore, John paid a total of $1800 for all the phones."
"To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. 

Given that Carlton's team has 13 players and Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = \text{Number of players on Carlton's team} + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 13 + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 20 \]

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

\[ \text{Total number of players} = \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} + \text{Number of players on Carlton's team} \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 20 + 13 \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is 33."
"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of slats} = 100 \]

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"Mrs. Harrington initially bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave away 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes given away. Therefore, she had 12 - 4 = 8 boxes left.

She then kept 1/4 of the remaining 8 boxes for herself. So, she kept 8 * 1/4 = 2 boxes.

This means she sold the rest, which is 8 - 2 = 6 boxes.

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the number of oranges she sold is 6 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 120 oranges.

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges."
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, the number of states in India can be expressed as \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India, which is \( x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \).

Simplifying the expression, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \).

Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is 79."
"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford the books, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books.

The cost of the dictionary is $18.
The cost of the dinosaur book is $13.
The cost of the children's cookbook is $8.

Adding these together gives us the total cost of the books:
\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

Tyler has already saved $14, so we need to find out how much more money he needs to buy the books:
\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:
\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Robert has 30 cherries.
2. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, so Richard has \(30 - 10 = 20\) cherries.
3. The total number of cherries is 60. If we add up the cherries that Robert and Richard have, we get \(30 + 20 = 50\) cherries.
4. This means Jerry has \(60 - 50 = 10\) cherries.
5. Now, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has: \(30 - 10 = 20\).

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

Final numerical answer:
20"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's determine the number of boxes sold for each type of baked good on both days.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 4 fewer boxes than on Sunday

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 5 more boxes than on Saturday
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Now, let's calculate the number of boxes sold on Sunday for each type of baked good.

- Gingerbread on Sunday: 10 (Saturday) + 5 = 15 boxes
- Apple pie on Sunday: 15 boxes (given)

Next, we calculate the total number of boxes sold for each type over the two days.

- Total gingerbread: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes
- Total apple pie: 15 (Sunday) - 4 (Saturday) = 11 boxes

Now, we calculate the earnings from each type of baked good.

- Earnings from gingerbread: 25 boxes * $6/box = $150
- Earnings from apple pie: 11 boxes * $15/box = $165

Finally, we add the earnings from both types of baked goods to find the total earnings for the two days.

- Total earnings: $150 (gingerbread) + $165 (apple pie) = $315

Therefore, Sunny earned a total of $315 for the two days."
"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of sunscreen Pamela will use during her vacation.
2. Determine how many bottles are required based on the total usage.

First, we calculate the total amount of sunscreen used:
- Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour.
- She will be outside for 4 hours a day.
- The vacation lasts for 8 days.

So, the total amount of sunscreen used is:
\[ 1 \, \text{ounce/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours/day} \times 8 \, \text{days} = 32 \, \text{ounces} \]

Next, we determine how many 8-ounce bottles are needed to provide 32 ounces of sunscreen:
\[ \frac{32 \, \text{ounces}}{8 \, \text{ounces/bottle}} = 4 \, \text{bottles} \]

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. Given that the blue car costs $100, we can calculate the price of the red car as follows:

40% of $100 is calculated as:
\[ 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \]

So, the red car costs:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Therefore, the price of the red car is $60.

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the blue car and the red car:
\[ 100 + 60 = 160 \]

Both cars cost a total of $160."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Emil is currently 19 years old.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years from now.
3. At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.
4. At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

Now, we need to find the current ages of Emil's dad and brother.

- Emil's dad will be 48 years old in 5 years, so his current age is 48 - 5 = 43 years old.
- Emil's brother will be 12 years old in 5 years, so his current age is 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother is 43 + 7 = 50.

Therefore, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 50."
"Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.

Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, which means her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.

Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which means her friend gave her 20 * 2 = 40 beads.

To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we add the beads from her mother, sister, and friend:

20 (from mother) + 30 (from sister) + 40 (from friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount of Thursday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) pounds.

The total amount of crawfish caught over the three days is \(3 + 12 + 6 = 21\) pounds.

If 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, then the number of servings Joe has is \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) servings.

Therefore, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish."
"First, let's calculate the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Since 20% of the class are football players, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of football players} = 20\% \times 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after accounting for the football players:

\[ \text{Remaining students} = 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We can calculate this as:

\[ \text{Number of cheerleaders or band members} = 25\% \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

Now, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early:

\[ \text{Total students leaving early} = 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is:

12"
"If Sophie wears size five boots, then Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, which means Charlie wears size \(5 \times 5 = 25\) boots.

To find the average size of the shoes worn by the two, we add their sizes together and divide by 2:

\[
\text{Average size} = \frac{5 + 25}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
\]

The average size of shoe worn by the two is 15."
"To determine how many additional flowers Pat needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them. Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Therefore, the total space required for each plant is:

\[1 \text{ foot (plant)} + 1.5 \text{ feet (space)} = 2.5 \text{ feet}\]

Next, we need to find out how many plants can fit in the 111 feet long flower bed. We do this by dividing the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each plant:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means Pat can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional flowers she needs to buy is:

\[44 - 17 = 27\]

Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:

\[27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, Pat will spend \(\boxed{162}\) dollars at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, so we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9 \text{ pretzels per day} \]

To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"To determine how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of the plants for one basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost for one basket:
- Each basket contains 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines.
- The cost of one petunia is $3.00.
- The cost of one sweet potato vine is $2.50.

The cost for the petunias in one basket is:
\[ 3 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00 \text{ per petunia} = \$9.00 \]

The cost for the sweet potato vines in one basket is:
\[ 2 \text{ sweet potato vines} \times \$2.50 \text{ per sweet potato vine} = \$5.00 \]

The total cost for one basket is:
\[ \$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00 \]

Since Katherine has 5 baskets, the total cost for all the baskets is:
\[ 5 \text{ baskets} \times \$14.00 \text{ per basket} = \$70.00 \]

Therefore, Katherine will spend:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil, so the remaining soil is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining 3 pounds of soil is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

Therefore, they can plant 3 roses."
"First, we need to calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times \$2,000.00 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with the $500.00 she sets aside each month. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

\[ \text{Number of shoes per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \]

Since she can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0.5 pairs per month, which means she can buy 1 pair every 2 months.

Now, we need to find out how many pairs she can buy in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

\[ \text{Number of pairs per year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months per pair}} = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time it takes for Emily to both peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp:
- Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
- To peel 90 shrimp, it would take \( \frac{90}{6} = 15 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to sauté 90 shrimp:
- Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- To sauté 90 shrimp, it would take \( \frac{90}{30} \times 10 = 3 \times 10 = 30 \) minutes.

Since peeling and sautéing are sequential tasks, we add the time for each task:
- Total time = Time to peel + Time to sauté = 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

45 minutes"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the temperature changes in the room over the given time periods.

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Over 3 hours, the temperature change is \(2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 6 \, \text{degrees}\).

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - Over 4 hours, the temperature change is \(3 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 12 \, \text{degrees}\).

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Over 2 hours, the temperature change is \(2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{degrees}\).

Now, we sum up the temperature changes:
- Cooling effect: \(6 \, \text{degrees} + 12 \, \text{degrees} = 18 \, \text{degrees}\).
- Warming effect: \(4 \, \text{degrees}\).

The net temperature change is:
\[18 \, \text{degrees} - 4 \, \text{degrees} = 14 \, \text{degrees}\].

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

**Final answer:**
14 degrees lower than the starting temperature."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet as \(D\).
2. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet, so Bill's age when he saw the comet the second time is \(3D\).
3. The time between the first and second sighting of the comet is 75 years, so the difference in their ages is 75 years. Therefore, \(3D - D = 75\).
4. Simplifying the equation, we get \(2D = 75\), so \(D = 37.5\).

This means Bill's dad was 37.5 years old when he saw the comet. Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times his dad's age at the first sighting, Bill's age at the second sighting was \(3 \times 37.5 = 112.5\) years old.

To find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to subtract the 75-year period between the first and second sightings from his age at the second sighting. So, \(112.5 - 75 = 37.5\).

Therefore, Bill was 37.5 years old when he saw the comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each type of payment and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill**: He writes one check per month for the electric bill. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

2. **Gas bill**: He writes one check per month for the gas bill. Again, there are 12 months in a year, so he writes:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

3. **Church**: He writes two checks per month to the church. Over the course of a year, he writes:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ checks}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service**: He writes one check every quarter to the pest and lawn service. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes:
   \[
   1 \times 4 = 4 \text{ checks}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52
\]

Therefore, Buford writes a total of 52 checks per year."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips each day. These trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes, so the first plane makes \(44 \times 2 = 88\) trips each day.

2. Out of these 88 trips, three-quarters of the flights are to Greece. So, the number of flights to Greece is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66\).

3. The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The remaining flights are \(88 - 66 = 22\). Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is \(\frac{22}{2} = 11\).

Therefore, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is 11."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds.
3. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Now, let's add up the total howling time for all three wolves:
- Tobias: 20 seconds
- Chikote: 40 seconds
- Igneous: 60 seconds

Total howling time in seconds = \(20 + 40 + 60 = 120\) seconds.

To convert the total howling time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[ \frac{120}{60} = 2 \]

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and then subtract that from the total cost of the trousers.

1. Adam's mother gave him $6.
2. Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.
3. The total amount of money given by his parents is \(6 + 12 = 18\) dollars.
4. The trousers cost $30.

Now, we subtract the total amount given by his parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings.

\(30 - 18 = 12\)

Adam had to contribute \(\boxed{12}\) dollars from his savings."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(Al\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
- \(A = 3\)
- \(Al = 4\)
- The total age of the children is 20, so \(A + Al + H + W = 20\).
- Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, so \(H = 2 \times \frac{A + Al + H + W}{4}\).

First, substitute the known values into the total age equation:
\[3 + 4 + H + W = 20\]
\[7 + H + W = 20\]
\[H + W = 13\]

Next, substitute the known values into the equation for Helene's age:
\[H = 2 \times \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times \frac{7 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = \frac{2(7 + H + W)}{4}\]
\[H = \frac{14 + 2H + 2W}{4}\]
\[4H = 14 + 2H + 2W\]
\[2H = 14 + 2W\]
\[H = 7 + W\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(H + W = 13\)
2. \(H = 7 + W\)

Substitute the second equation into the first:
\[7 + W + W = 13\]
\[7 + 2W = 13\]
\[2W = 6\]
\[W = 3\]

So, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the total amount of money collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund. This is $500 from the neighbors plus $1500 from the online fund, which totals $2000.

Walter's friend then contributes $200. Adding this to the previous total, we get $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Walter's lawyer is going to donate three times the total amount collected from everyone else. Since the total collected from everyone else is $2200, the lawyer's contribution will be 3 * $2200 = $6600.

Therefore, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ 50 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is \( 2 + 4 = 6 \). The total size of the watermelon can be represented as the sum of the sizes of all the slices. Therefore, the total size of the watermelon is \( 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \).

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of each adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his activities and subtract this from the nine hours he has available.

1. Time spent on inpatient rounds:
   - He has 9 inpatients.
   - Each round takes 20 minutes.
   - Total time for rounds = 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes.

2. Time spent on appointments:
   - He has 10 appointments.
   - Each appointment takes 30 minutes.
   - Total time for appointments = 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes.

3. Total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments:
   - Total time = 180 minutes (rounds) + 300 minutes (appointments) = 480 minutes.

4. Convert the total time spent into hours:
   - 480 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 8 hours.

5. Subtract the total time spent from the 9 hours available:
   - 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

Therefore, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to work backwards from the time she wants to serve it, which is 5:00 pm.

1. Frosting the cake takes 10 minutes.
2. Cooling the cake takes 2 hours (120 minutes).
3. Baking the cake takes 30 minutes.
4. Making the cake batter takes 20 minutes.

Adding these times together:
- 10 minutes (frosting) + 120 minutes (cooling) + 30 minutes (baking) + 20 minutes (making batter) = 180 minutes

180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours.

Now, subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
- 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to have it ready to serve at 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm.

2:00 pm"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter.
2. Use the total number of chocolate bars sold to find the number of bars per box.

First, let's add the number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter:
- Lisa sold 3.5 boxes.
- Peter sold 4.5 boxes.

Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

They sold 64 chocolate bars together. To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:

Number of chocolate bars per box = Total chocolate bars / Total boxes
Number of chocolate bars per box = 64 / 8
Number of chocolate bars per box = 8

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per session for the studio.
2. Calculate the total cost per day for the studio.
3. Calculate the total cost per week for the studio.
4. Calculate the total cost per month for the studio.

First, let's calculate the cost per session for the studio:
- The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
- The cost per student per session is $1.50.
- With 10 students, the cost per session for students is \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost per session for the studio is \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost per day for the studio:
- The studio is rented 3 days a week.
- So, the total cost per day is \(40 \times 3 = 120\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost per week for the studio:
- Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the total cost per week is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) dollars.

Finally, we calculate the total cost per month for the studio:
- The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is \(480 \times 4 = 1920\) dollars.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $1920."
"To solve this problem, we can set up equations based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( P \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( M \).

From the problem, we know:
- Peter has 4 boxes, so the total number of chocolate bars Peter has is \( 4P = 64 \).
- Martha has 7 boxes, so the total number of chocolate bars Martha has is \( 7M = 56 \).

First, we solve for \( P \) and \( M \):
\[ 4P = 64 \]
\[ P = \frac{64}{4} \]
\[ P = 16 \]

\[ 7M = 56 \]
\[ M = \frac{56}{7} \]
\[ M = 8 \]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:
\[ P - M = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

Final numerical answer:

"To find the number of porcupines in the park after a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of female porcupines.
2. Determine the number of baby porcupines born each month.
3. Calculate the total number of baby porcupines born in a year.
4. Add the number of baby porcupines to the initial population to get the final number of porcupines.

Step 1: Calculate the number of female porcupines.
The number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population.
\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Step 2: Determine the number of baby porcupines born each month.
Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
\[ \text{Number of baby porcupines born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of baby porcupines born in a year.
There are 12 months in a year.
\[ \text{Total number of baby porcupines born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

Step 4: Add the number of baby porcupines to the initial population to get the final number of porcupines.
\[ \text{Final number of porcupines} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

Final numerical answer:

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the price per gallon.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) can be calculated using the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:
\[ V = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.**

The conversion factor is 5.9 gallons per cubic foot. So, we multiply the volume in cubic feet by 5.9 to get the volume in gallons:
\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 5.9 \, \text{gallons/cubic foot} \]
\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost based on the price per gallon.**

The cost is $0.10 per gallon. So, we multiply the volume in gallons by the cost per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{\$/gallon} \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is $826."
"To find the total number of sticks, let's break down the information given:

1. There are 9 red sticks.
2. There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so the number of blue sticks is \(9 + 5 = 14\).
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is \(14 - 3 = 11\).

Now, to find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

\[9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34\]

Therefore, the total number of sticks they have is 34."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

For Matteo:
- Speed = 55 miles per hour
- Time = 4 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

For Shandy:
- Speed = 45 miles per hour
- Time = 10 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo:
- Difference in distance = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ laps} \]

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run:
\[ 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ laps} \]

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \text{ laps} \]

Therefore, Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
   - Tank's capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Water filled by Wanda on the first day = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
   - Water filled by Ms. B on the first day = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the first day = \( 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \) gallons.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water pumped by Wanda on the second day = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final charge percentage to the initial charge percentage when Maria left for the park. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Final Charge Calculation:**
   - After 8 hours, the power bank was at 28% charge.

2. **Charge Loss in the Last 3 Hours:**
   - For the last 3 hours, the power bank lost 7% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge percentage at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge would be \( x - 3 \times 7\% = x - 21\% \).
   - We know this equals 28%, so:
     \[
     x - 21\% = 28\%
     \]
     \[
     x = 28\% + 21\% = 49\%
     \]

3. **Charge Loss in the First 5 Hours:**
   - For the first 5 hours, the power bank lost 9% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge percentage at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge would be \( y - 5 \times 9\% = y - 45\% \).
   - We know this equals 49%, so:
     \[
     y - 45\% = 49\%
     \]
     \[
     y = 49\% + 45\% = 94\%
     \]

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%."
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment for the car, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings.
2. Determine the amount she needs to save for the down payment.
3. Calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save the required amount.

**Step 1: Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings.**

Janet earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips. If she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are:
\[ 40 \text{ hours/week} \times (\$10/\text{hour} + \$15/\text{hour}) = 40 \times \$25 = \$1000 \text{ per week} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount she needs to save for the down payment.**

The car costs $10,000, and Janet wants to save 20% of this amount for a down payment. So, the down payment amount is:
\[ 20\% \times \$10000 = 0.20 \times \$10000 = \$2000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save the required amount.**

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount needed by her weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{\$2000}{\$1000 \text{ per week}} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, Janet will need to work for \(\boxed{2}\) weeks to save the down payment."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jamaar has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost of the items already purchased:

\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10, so the amount of money he has left after his purchases is:

\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:

\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums."
"First, we calculate the total number of sweets Anne has:

Total packs = 15
Sweets per pack = 60

Total sweets = 15 packs * 60 sweets/pack = 900 sweets

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is:

Packs given to friends = Total packs - Packs kept
Packs given to friends = 15 - 2 = 13 packs

Now, we calculate the number of sweets given to her friends:

Sweets given to friends = Packs given to friends * Sweets per pack
Sweets given to friends = 13 packs * 60 sweets/pack = 780 sweets

Since these sweets are divided equally among her 10 friends:

Sweets per friend = Sweets given to friends / Number of friends
Sweets per friend = 780 sweets / 10 friends = 78 sweets

Each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, given that the price increases by 5% each year, we can use the formula for compound interest, which in this context is the formula for compound price increase:

- \( P \) is the final price after \( n \) years.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price.
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (expressed as a decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% increase)
- \( n = 3 \) years

Plugging in the values:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Olivia uploaded 72 pictures in total.
2. She put the same number of pictures into 8 albums.
3. 3 of the albums were selfies only.
4. 2 of the albums were portraits only.

First, we need to find out how many pictures are in each album. Since the total number of pictures is 72 and they are evenly distributed among 8 albums, we divide 72 by 8:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

So, each album contains 9 pictures.

Next, we need to determine the total number of selfies and portraits. We know that 3 albums are selfies only and 2 albums are portraits only. Therefore, the total number of selfies is:

\[ 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 27 \text{ selfies} \]

And the total number of portraits is:

\[ 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 18 \text{ portraits} \]

Adding the number of selfies and portraits together gives us the total number of selfies and portraits:

\[ 27 \text{ selfies} + 18 \text{ portraits} = 45 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 45 \]"
"To find out how long James spends reading, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how long it takes James to read one page.
2. Calculate the total time spent reading 18 pages.

First, we know that James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. Therefore, the time it takes to read one page is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes to read 18 pages. We multiply the time it takes to read one page by 18:
\[ 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of guests**: The hotel started with 100 guests.

2. **Early checkouts**: 24 guests elected to check out early. So, the number of guests after early checkouts is:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]

3. **Late checkouts**: 15 guests elected to check out late. So, the number of guests after late checkouts is:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]

4. **Afternoon check-ins**: Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, the number of guests who checked in in the afternoon is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   So, the number of guests after the afternoon check-ins is:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91

Therefore, Aries is sure to get 36 points."
"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( x \). Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (2x \times S) + (x \times L) \]

Substituting the values of \( S \) and \( L \):
\[ 120 = (2x \times 4) + (x \times 12) \]
\[ 120 = 8x + 12x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, and Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals."

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich for each package and then use that to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

First, let's calculate the price per sandwich for each package:

1. For the first package:
   - 2 sandwiches for $3
   - Price per sandwich = $3 / 2 = $1.50

2. For the second package:
   - 4 sandwiches for $6
   - Price per sandwich = $6 / 4 = $1.50

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages, which is $1.50.

Now, we can find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
- Cost = 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12."
"First, we need to determine the remaining amount Tom needs to pay after selling his old bedroom set. He buys a new one for $3000 and sells his old one for $1000, so the remaining amount is:

\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% of this remaining amount each month. To find out how much he has to pay per month, we calculate 10% of $2000:

\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst due to the wind. 

\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]

So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving her with:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of her 12 yellow balloons:

\[ 12 \times 0.50 = 6 \]

So, she lost 6 yellow balloons, leaving her with:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

As she approached the school, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her collection:

\[ 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]

Adding these 6 blue balloons to her remaining balloons:

\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 6 \text{ (blue)} = 27 \]

Therefore, the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school is:

\[ 27 \]"
"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.5
   - If a substitute teacher is present, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. So, the probability of not having to turn in his homework in this scenario is 100% or 1.0.

2. **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher being present: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.4
   - If the normal teacher gives an extension, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework. So, the probability of not having to turn in his homework in this scenario is 0.4.

3. **Normal Teacher without Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher being present: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.6
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension: 20% or 0.2
   - Probability of Marcus not getting a personal extension: 80% or 0.8
   - If Marcus does not get a personal extension, he has to turn in his homework. So, the probability of having to turn in his homework in this scenario is 0.8.

Now, we calculate the overall probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework by considering the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension:

- Probability of having a substitute teacher: 0.5
- Probability of the normal teacher being present and giving an extension: \(0.5 \times 0.4 = 0.2\)
- Probability of the normal teacher being present, not giving an extension, and Marcus not getting a personal extension: \(0.5 \times 0.6 \times 0.8 = 0.24\)

Adding these probabilities together gives the total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

\[0.5 + 0.2 + 0.24 = 0.94\]

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

\[0.94 \times 100 = 94\%\]

**94%**"
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats already allocated for graduates and faculty.
2. Subtract this number from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center to find out how many seats are available for tickets to be given to friends and family.
3. Divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total seats for graduates and faculty: 950 (graduates) + 300 (faculty) = 1250 seats
2. Available seats for tickets: 6000 (total capacity) - 1250 (allocated seats) = 4750 seats
3. Tickets per graduate: 4750 (available seats) / 950 (number of graduates) = 5 tickets

Each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish the relationship between the different sizes of jelly beans.

1. First, we know that 75 large jelly beans fill Grandpa up.
2. Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large jelly beans. Therefore, the number of medium-sized jelly beans he can eat is:
   \[
   2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium-sized jelly beans}
   \]
3. Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized jelly bean. Therefore, the number of small jelly beans that is equivalent to 150 medium-sized jelly beans is:
   \[
   3 \times 150 = 450 \text{ small jelly beans}
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of soda bottles Richard will place.
2. Determine the total time it will take to place all the bottles and drop the candy.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of soda bottles.**

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. This means the number of intervals between the bottles is 24 / 3 = 8. Since there is a bottle at the start and one at the end of each interval, the total number of bottles is 8 + 1 = 9.

**Step 2: Determine the total time.**

Richard takes 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next. Since there are 8 intervals between the 9 bottles, the total time to place all the bottles and drop the candy is 8 * 5 = 40 seconds.

**Final Answer:**
40 seconds"
"To find out how many packs of apples Uncle Franky can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of apples in two boxes.
2. Divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of apples in two boxes.
- Each box contains 40 apples.
- Uncle Franky ordered 2 boxes.
- Total apples = 40 apples/box * 2 boxes = 80 apples.

Step 2: Divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack.
- Uncle Franky plans to pack the apples with 8 apples in one pack.
- Number of packs = Total apples / Apples per pack = 80 apples / 8 apples/pack = 10 packs.

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese Amor buys and then subtract that from the $50 she starts with.

First, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:
- The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound.
- Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.
- Therefore, the cost of the Parmesan cheese is \(2 \times 11 = 22\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the Mozzarella cheese:
- The price of Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
- Amor buys 3 pounds of Mozzarella cheese.
- Therefore, the cost of the Mozzarella cheese is \(3 \times 6 = 18\) dollars.

Now, let's find the total cost of the cheese:
- The total cost is the sum of the cost of the Parmesan and Mozzarella cheese.
- Therefore, the total cost is \(22 + 18 = 40\) dollars.

Finally, let's calculate how much money Amor will have left after buying the cheese:
- Amor starts with $50.
- She spends $40 on cheese.
- Therefore, the money left is \(50 - 40 = 10\) dollars.

So, the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat is $10."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim borrowed for college, the total income he would have earned without going to college, and the total income he will earn with his college degree. Then, we can determine how long it will take for him to earn back the money he spent on college and the money he lost by not working during those four years.

1. **Calculate the total amount borrowed for college:**
   - Jim borrows $50,000 per year for 4 years.
   - Total amount borrowed = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

2. **Calculate the total income lost from not working during college:**
   - Jim had a job that paid $25,000 per year.
   - Total income lost = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn back:**
   - Total amount to earn back = Total amount borrowed + Total income lost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

4. **Calculate Jim's new income after earning a college degree:**
   - His income tripled, so his new income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year.

5. **Determine how long it will take to earn back the $300,000:**
   - Time to earn back = Total amount to earn back / New annual income = $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces he requires. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece will be:
6 feet (bed length) + 2 feet = 8 feet

And the width of each fabric piece will be:
8 feet (bed width) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
Area = Length × Width
Area = 8 feet × 10 feet
Area = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
Total area = 80 square feet × 2
Total area = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Monday's Delivery:**
   - The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday's Delivery:**
   - One-fifth of Monday's delivery: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)

3. **Wednesday's Delivery:**
   - Twice as many as Tuesday's delivery: \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \)
   - 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery: \( 204 + 5 = 209 \)

4. **Total Delivery from Monday to Wednesday:**
   - Monday: 425
   - Tuesday: 102
   - Wednesday: 209
   - Total: \( 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \)

The post office delivered a total of 736 letters from Monday to Wednesday."

2. For the pasta salad:
- Number of people: 6
- Cost per person: $6
- Total cost for pasta salad: \(6 \times 6 = 36\) dollars

Now, we add the total costs for both salads to get the overall total cost:
- Total cost for chicken salad: $65
- Total cost for pasta salad: $36
- Overall total cost: \(65 + 36 = 101\) dollars

Therefore, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is:
101 dollars"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. So, he won \(2 \times 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11\) dollars.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost and won:

- Total loss: $5 (first race) + $16.5 (third race) = $21.5
- Total win: $11 (second race)

Net loss: $21.5 - $11 = $10.5

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races (3):

\[
\text{Average loss} = \frac{10.5}{3} = 3.5
\]

So, Johnny's dad lost on average $3.5 per race that day."
"To find the total population of South America based on the given information, we can follow these steps:

2. Determine the population of each city: Each city has 1000 people.
3. Calculate the total population: Multiply the number of cities by the population of each city. So, the total population is \(130 \times 1000 = 130,000\).

Therefore, the total population of South America, based on the given conditions, is 130,000 people."
"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we first need to calculate their current heights.

Xavier was originally 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert Xavier's original height to inches:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
Adding the growth:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was originally 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem, the second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation as:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is $420."
"To determine the total hours of work each painter put in, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days the painters worked.
2. Determine the total fraction of a day worked per day.
3. Convert the fraction of a day to hours.
4. Calculate the total hours worked by the team.
5. Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours each painter worked.

Let's go through each step:

1. The team worked for 3 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days worked is:
   \[
   3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}
   \]

2. The team worked \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day each day.

3. To convert \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day to hours, we multiply by 24 (since there are 24 hours in a day):
   \[
   \frac{3}{8} \times 24 = 9 \text{ hours/day}
   \]

4. The total hours worked by the team over 21 days is:
   \[
   21 \text{ days} \times 9 \text{ hours/day} = 189 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. Since there are 4 painters, the hours each painter worked is:
   \[
   \frac{189 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ painters}} = 47.25 \text{ hours/painter}
   \]

Therefore, each painter put in 47.25 hours of work."
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
1. In the first set, he retrieved four more balls than in the second set, so he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
2. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
3. The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) + 2(4) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + x + 8 = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, we can find the number of balls he retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% of its value each year (100% - 21% = 79%).

The formula to calculate the value after depreciation is:
\[ \text{Value after depreciation} = \text{Initial value} \times (1 - \text{depreciation rate})^{\text{number of years}} \]

Here, the initial value is $20,000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years is 3 (from 2007 to 2010).

Let's calculate the value in 2010:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the price of the car in 2010 is $9861.

Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 is $9861."
"To find the number of Spanish books, we first need to determine the number of books written in English and German.

1. Half of the 50 books are written in English:
   \[
   \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ books in English}
   \]

2. 10% of the 50 books are written in German:
   \[
   0.10 \times 50 = 5 \text{ books in German}
   \]

3. To find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

Distance remaining to be driven = 1955 kilometers - 325 kilometers
Distance remaining to be driven = 1630 kilometers

Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers."
"Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Over 30 days, she would drink:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, the number of gallons she drinks in 30 days is:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people descend, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 people descend. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110

"To determine the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor with the new square tiles, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of tiles needed.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of tiles and their price.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of tiles needed.**

Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is:
\[ 1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt} \]

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt. Therefore, the number of tiles required is:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ SqFt}}{1 \text{ SqFt/tile}} = 200 \text{ tiles} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost.**

Each tile costs $12. Therefore, the total cost for 200 tiles is:
\[ 200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12/\text{tile} = \$2400 \]

**Final Answer:**
The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor with the new square tiles is \$2400."
"To find out how much James pays for insurance a year after the accident, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.
2. Determine the total annual cost based on the increased monthly cost.

First, let's calculate the increased monthly cost. The normal cost is $120 a month, and the insurance cost increased by 60% due to the accident. To find 60% of $120, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Increased Cost} = \text{Normal Cost} \times \left(1 + \frac{\text{Percentage Increase}}{100}\right) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Increased Cost} = 120 \times \left(1 + \frac{60}{100}\right) = 120 \times 1.60 = 192 \]

So, the increased monthly cost is $192.

Next, we calculate the total annual cost by multiplying the increased monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):

\[ \text{Annual Cost} = \text{Increased Monthly Cost} \times 12 = 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for his insurance."
"Greg uses 4 twin beds + 1 king bed = 5 beds per week.

Since he washes 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time, he needs to do 2 loads for the twins and 1 load for the king, totaling 3 loads per week.

In a year, there are 52 weeks, so he would do 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads of laundry in a year.

156"
"Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend (Saturday and Sunday), they watch a total of 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

Over 4 weeks, the total number of movies they can watch is 6 movies/weekend * 4 weekends = 24 movies.

"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so his collection increased to:
100 (previous amount) + 50 (collected last year) = 150 stickers.

This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as last year, which is:
2 * 50 = 100 stickers.

Adding this year's collection to his last year's total gives:
150 (last year's total) + 100 (collected this year) = 250 stickers.

So, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection."
"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food consumed per day and then divide the total amount of cat food by this daily consumption.

1. Calculate the daily consumption of cat food:
   - Imma has 3 cats.
   - Each cat is fed 60 grams of food twice a day.
   - Therefore, each cat consumes \(60 \, \text{grams} \times 2 = 120 \, \text{grams}\) per day.
   - For 3 cats, the total daily consumption is \(120 \, \text{grams} \times 3 = 360 \, \text{grams}\).

2. Calculate how many days 720 grams of cat food will last:
   - Total cat food available: 720 grams.
   - Daily consumption: 360 grams.
   - Number of days the food will last: \( \frac{720 \, \text{grams}}{360 \, \text{grams/day}} = 2 \, \text{days} \).

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \(7 \times 2 = 14\) slices. 

To find the total number of slices they ate, we add the slices eaten by each person:
\[10 + 7 + 14 = 31\]

Therefore, the total number of slices they ate is 31."
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, we can express Betsy's part as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for the meal is the sum of both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part is 18 minutes longer, we calculate Betsy's part as:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long."
"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to add up all the individual charges:

1. **Cast**: $200
2. **Doctor's Visit**: The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the charge would be half of $300, which is $150.
3. **Painkillers**: $4 per pill for 30 pills, which totals to $4 * 30 = $120.
4. **Parking**: $6 per hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours, which totals to $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, we add all these charges together:

$200 (cast) + $150 (doctor's visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"First, we need to determine how many emails James receives in a day that require a response. Since 20% of the emails don't require any response, that means 80% of the emails do require a response.

80% of 80 emails is calculated as follows:
\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \]

So, James responds to 64 emails each day. 

Next, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week:
\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
320"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes for each day and then sum them up.

- Monday: 32 classes
- Tuesday: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes
- Wednesday: Three times as many as Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes
- Thursday: 30 classes
- Friday: 25 classes

Now, we add these numbers together:

\[32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247\]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."
"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we first need to calculate the total score for all tests and then divide by the number of tests.

John's scores are:
- 100 on the first test
- 100 on the second test
- 100 on the third test
- 80 on the fourth test

The total score is:
100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

The average score is the total score divided by the number of tests:
380 / 4 = 95

Therefore, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by both the glee club and the football team, and then subtract these from the total number of pizzas ordered.

1. **Glee Club:**
   - Ordered 20 pizzas.
   - Ate 70% of them.
   - Number of pizzas eaten by the glee club = 20 * 70% = 20 * 0.70 = 14 pizzas.

2. **Football Team:**
   - Ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so 20 * 2 = 40 pizzas.
   - Ate 80% of them.
   - Number of pizzas eaten by the football team = 40 * 80% = 40 * 0.80 = 32 pizzas.

3. **Total Pizzas Eaten:**
   - Total pizzas eaten = 14 (glee club) + 32 (football team) = 46 pizzas.

4. **Total Pizzas Ordered:**
   - Total pizzas ordered = 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

5. **Pizzas Left:**
   - Pizzas left = Total pizzas ordered - Total pizzas eaten = 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

**Final Answer:**
14 pizzas are left."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of mailing both the small and big coupons.

First, let's determine the number of each type of coupon:
- Anthony is sending out 700 small coupons.
- He is sending out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, so he sends out \(2 \times 700 = 1400\) big coupons.

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing each type of coupon:
- The cost to mail one small coupon is 5 cents, so the total cost for 700 small coupons is \(700 \times 5 = 3500\) cents.
- The cost to mail one big coupon is 15 cents, so the total cost for 1400 big coupons is \(1400 \times 15 = 21000\) cents.

Now, we add the costs together to find the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of small coupons + cost of big coupons
- Total cost = 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, we convert the total cost to dollars:
- Total cost in dollars = \(24500 \div 100 = 245\) dollars

Therefore, Anthony spends a total of 245 dollars on postage."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Order by Sidney:**
   - Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches.
   - So, Sidney ordered \(10 - 3 = 7\) meatball sub sandwiches.
   - Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.
   - Therefore, the total number of meatballs in Sidney's initial order is \(7 \times 4 = 28\) meatballs.

2. **Mark's Consumption:**
   - Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches.
   - So, the number of meatball sub sandwiches remaining after Mark ate is \(7 - 4 = 3\) sub sandwiches.
   - The number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) meatballs.

3. **Additional Order by Sidney:**
   - Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches.
   - The number of meatballs in these additional sub sandwiches is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) meatballs.

4. **Total Meatballs in Remaining Sub Sandwiches:**
   - The total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is the sum of the meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches after Mark ate and the additional sub sandwiches ordered by Sidney.
   - So, the total number of meatballs is \(12 + 12 = 24\) meatballs.

Final numerical answer:
24"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of trucks that had mechanical failures.
2. Calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser.
3. Calculate the total amount of fertiliser delivered.

Step 1: Calculate the number of trucks with mechanical failures.
A quarter of the 20 trucks had mechanical failures:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks} \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser.
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of fertiliser delivered.
Each truck carried 20 tons of fertiliser, so:
\[ 15 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 300 \text{ tons} \]

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:
\[ 300 \text{ tons} \]"
"Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. Since he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The promotion at the grocery store is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter he buys, he gets a second pound at half the price.

The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound. Under the promotion, the cost for the second pound is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.

For 6 pounds of butter, we can consider the purchase in sets of 2 pounds (since the promotion applies to every two pounds). So, we have 3 sets of 2 pounds.

The cost for the first pound in each set is $4.00, and the second pound is $2.00. Therefore, the cost for each set of 2 pounds is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

Since he needs 6 pounds, which is 3 sets of 2 pounds, the total cost is 3 sets * $6.00 per set = $18.00.

Therefore, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter is $18.00."
"First, let's determine the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- 25 classmates
- 7 girls in her dance class
- 13 family members

Total guests invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Since 4 people said they could not come, the actual number of guests attending the party is:

45 - 4 = 41

The cost to rent the theater is $125, and there is an additional $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20. So, the number of additional guests is:

41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is:

21 * $6 = $126

Therefore, the total cost of the party is:

$125 (rent) + $126 (additional guests) = $251

The party will cost $251."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine how much money Maggie and Riza each had initially.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money and was left with $60. This means that the remaining three-quarters of her money is $60. We can set up the equation for Maggie as follows:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times \text{Maggie's initial money} = 60
\]

To find Maggie's initial money, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Maggie's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
\]

So, Maggie initially had $80.

Next, we determine how much money Riza initially had. Riza spent one-third of her money and was left with $60. This means that the remaining two-thirds of her money is $60. We can set up the equation for Riza as follows:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times \text{Riza's initial money} = 60
\]

To find Riza's initial money, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Riza's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
\]

So, Riza initially had $90.

Now, we calculate how much money each of them has left after spending.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20
\]

So, Maggie has:

\[
80 - 20 = 60
\]

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
\]

So, Riza has:

\[
90 - 30 = 60
\]

Finally, we add the remaining amounts of money that Maggie and Riza have:

\[
60 + 60 = 120
\]

Therefore, the two of them have a total of $120 left."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine the total number of bananas each monkey eats in a week.

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. So, in a week (7 days), the first monkey eats:
   \[ 10 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ bananas} \]

2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day. So, the second monkey eats:
   \[ 10 \text{ bananas/day} + 4 \text{ bananas} = 14 \text{ bananas/day} \]
   In a week, the second monkey eats:
   \[ 14 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 98 \text{ bananas} \]

3. The total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a week is:
   \[ 70 \text{ bananas} + 98 \text{ bananas} = 168 \text{ bananas} \]

4. The total number of bananas bought by Mr. Robles is 315. So, the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week is:
   \[ 315 \text{ bananas} - 168 \text{ bananas} = 147 \text{ bananas} \]

5. To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide the weekly total by 7:
   \[ 147 \text{ bananas} \div 7 \text{ days} = 21 \text{ bananas/day} \]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day."
"Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed 250 pieces. Then, he started and finished another 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed all 500 pieces of the second puzzle.

So, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is:

250 (from the first puzzle) + 500 (from the second puzzle) = 750 pieces.

750 pieces"
"First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since roses can be bought at $2 each, the total cost for 15 roses is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which totals:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she needs an additional $5 to cover the cost. The florist does not have enough change in quarters to cover the exact amount, so Jenny would need to find the remaining $5 elsewhere or the florist would need to provide a different form of change.

Since the question asks how many quarters Jenny leaves with, and she does not have enough money to cover the cost, the answer is that she leaves with 0 quarters."
"To calculate the total money Terry makes, we need to multiply the quantity of each item by its price and then sum up the totals.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Departs after 30 minutes (10 + 20).

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train departs, which is 60 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Stays for 1/4 of the first train's stay time, which is 5 minutes (20 / 4).
   - Departs after 65 minutes (60 + 5).

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train departs, which is 125 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives, so it departs at 125 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train departs, which is 145 minutes after the first train arrives.

Paul will board the fourth train at 145 minutes after he arrives at the station. Since he arrives at the station at time 0, he will wait 145 minutes for his train.

**Final Answer:**

"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we first need to calculate how many toothpicks she has already saved and then figure out how many more she needs to save.

1. Calculate the total number of toothpicks Melanie has saved so far:
   - She saves 10 toothpicks each week.
   - She has been saving for 12 weeks.
   - Therefore, the total number of toothpicks saved is \(10 \times 12 = 120\).

2. Determine how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to save to reach 200:
   - She needs 200 toothpicks in total.
   - She has already saved 120 toothpicks.
   - Therefore, the number of toothpicks she still needs is \(200 - 120 = 80\).

3. Calculate how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks:
   - She saves 10 toothpicks each week.
   - To find out how many weeks it will take to save 80 toothpicks, we divide 80 by 10.
   - Therefore, the number of weeks needed is \(80 \div 10 = 8\).

So, it will take Melanie \(\boxed{8}\) more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price, which is $2000.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to calculate the difference between the original price and the price Mr. Rogers' friend paid, and then express this difference as a percentage of the original price.

\[ \text{Discount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, a single spring creates 1 jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - 1 minute = 60 seconds
   - Therefore, 4 hours = 4 × 60 × 60 = 14,400 seconds

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since 1 jellyfish is created every second, in 14,400 seconds, one spring will create 14,400 jellyfish.

4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14,400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create 5 × 14,400 = 72,000 jellyfish.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To find Frankie's score, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that Binkie's score is 90, and Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score.

Let's denote Binkie's score as \( B \) and Frankie's score as \( F \).

From the problem, we have:
\[ B = 90 \]
\[ F = 2B + 15 \]

Substituting the value of \( B \) into the equation for \( F \):
\[ F = 2(90) + 15 \]
\[ F = 180 + 15 \]
\[ F = 195 \]

Frankie's score is 195."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. James's home is 4 miles from the store.
2. He walks halfway to the store, which is 2 miles.
3. He then walks back home, covering another 2 miles.
4. He then walks the full 4 miles to the store.

The total distance James walks is:
- 2 miles (to halfway point)
- 2 miles (back home)
- 4 miles (to the store)

So, the total distance is 2 + 2 + 4 = 8 miles.

James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find the time it takes to walk 8 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it took James 2 hours to reach the store."
"To determine how much money Jenny saved, we need to compare the cost of buying 10 bunches of bananas versus buying 40 individual bananas (since each bunch averages 4 bananas and she bought 10 bunches).

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches of bananas:
- Each bunch costs $3.00.
- Therefore, the cost for 10 bunches is \(10 \times 3 = 30\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 40 individual bananas:
- Each individual banana costs $0.80.
- Therefore, the cost for 40 bananas is \(40 \times 0.80 = 32\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between buying the bananas individually and in bunches:
- The cost of buying 40 bananas individually is $32.00.
- The cost of buying 10 bunches is $30.00.
- The savings is \(32 - 30 = 2\) dollars.

Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \).

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total length of the fence is 100 feet.
2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( S + H = 100 \)
2. \( H = S + 60 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]
\[ 2S = 40 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. 

Final numerical answer:
20"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we can first determine the growth rate per year and then apply it to the 13-year period.

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. So, the growth rate per year is:

\[ \text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \]

Now, to find out how much it will grow in 13 years:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of each type of bike sold.
2. Calculate the earnings from each type of bike.
3. Sum up the earnings to get the total.

First, let's calculate the number of each type of bike sold:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Trekking bikes: 50% of 300 = 0.50 * 300 = 150 bikes
- BMX bikes: 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45 bikes
- MTB bikes: The rest, which is 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 bikes

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:

- Price of an MTB: $500
- Price of a BMX: $500 / 2 = $250
- Price of a Trekking bike: $450

Now, we calculate the earnings:

- Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 bikes * $500 = $52,500
- Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 bikes * $250 = $11,250
- Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 bikes * $450 = $67,500

Finally, we sum up the earnings:

Total earnings = $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

Marcel earned $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the rate of hay production and pickup:**
   - The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.
   - The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.

2. **Calculate the net change in the number of bales per hour:**
   - Net change per hour = Hay produced - Hay picked up
   - Net change per hour = 5 bales - 3 bales = 2 bales

3. **Calculate the total net change over 6 hours:**
   - Total net change = Net change per hour * Number of hours
   - Total net change = 2 bales/hour * 6 hours = 12 bales

4. **Determine the number of bales left in the field:**
   - Since the farmer starts with a certain number of bales (which is not specified), we can only calculate the net change in the number of bales.
   - If we assume the field starts with 0 bales (or the initial number of bales is not relevant to the net change calculation), then the number of bales left in the field after 6 hours is the total net change.

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field after 6 hours is 12."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long. Therefore, the total time spent in classes each weekday is:

\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total time spent in classes during the weekdays is:

\[ 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on these days. First, we find \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly class time:

\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he spends this amount of time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time for the weekend is:

\[ 100 \text{ minutes} \times 2 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent in classes during the weekdays and the extra learning time on the weekend to get the total weekly learning time:

\[ 1600 \text{ minutes} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, John spends 30 hours a week learning."
"To determine how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the height the ball bounces to on the first bounce.
2. Use that height to calculate the height of the second bounce.

First bounce height:
The ball is dropped from a height of 24 feet. Since it bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height, the height after the first bounce is:
\[ 24 \times \frac{2}{3} = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Second bounce height:
The ball then bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height it reached after the first bounce. So, the height after the second bounce is:
\[ 16 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{32}{3} \text{ feet} \]
\[ \frac{32}{3} \approx 10.67 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is \(\frac{32}{3}\) feet, or approximately 10.67 feet.

Final numerical answer:
\(\frac{32}{3}\) feet or approximately 10.67 feet."
"The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child's height in inches is:

\[ 6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is:

\[ 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches} \]

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is:

\[ 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches} \]

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is:

\[ 69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we first need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now, if each bag is sold for $5, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags by the price per bag:

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

Therefore, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the Triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the Triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.

2. The Velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.

3. The Allosaurus then ate the last 270 kilograms, which means \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \) kilograms.

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the Triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate."
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are 10 feet by 8 feet, so each wall has an area of \(10 \times 8 = 80\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is \(80 \times 2 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are 5 feet by 8 feet, so each wall has an area of \(5 \times 8 = 40\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is \(40 \times 2 = 80\) square feet.

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[160 + 80 = 240\] square feet.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[\frac{240}{20} = 12\] gallons.

Finally, since each gallon costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[12 \times 12 = 144\] dollars.

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is $144."
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the probability step by step.

1. Ellen starts with a case of 12 sodas and shakes 3 of them.
2. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas in total.
3. Ellen's brother takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken sodas and 7 unshaken sodas.

Now, there are 9 sodas left, with 2 of them being shaken. The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left.

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas left}} = \frac{2}{9} \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ \frac{2}{9} \times 100 = \frac{200}{9} \approx 22.22\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately 22.22%."
"To find out how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, the distance it has traveled is:
\[ 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is:
\[ \frac{60 \, \text{miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \]
After 3 hours, the distance it has traveled is:
\[ 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the distances together gives the total distance between the two trains after 3 hours:
\[ 180 \, \text{miles} + 90 \, \text{miles} = 270 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, after 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy works, given that he takes 20% of the days off.
3. Calculate the total number of people Billy can help based on his working hours.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.**

- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st, there are 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.
- Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy works.**

- Billy takes 20% of the days off, so he works 80% of the days.
- Number of days Billy works = 50 days * 80% = 50 * 0.8 = 40 days.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of people Billy can help.**

- Billy can help 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day.
- Number of people Billy helps per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day.
- Total number of people Billy helps = 40 days * 6 people/day = 240 people.

**Final Answer:**
Billy helps 240 people."
"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry. 

First, let's calculate the number of people that the buses could carry:
- There were 12 buses.
- Each bus carried 35 people.

So, the total number of people carried by the buses is:
\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people/bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of people that the cars could carry:
- There were 20 cars.
- Each car carried 3 people.

So, the total number of people carried by the cars is:
\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people/car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Now, we add the number of people carried by the buses and the cars to find the total number of people inside the church:
\[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people inside the church is:
\[ 480 \]"
"To find out how old Jeff is, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each of the slides and then find the difference between these times.

For the biggest slide:
- Length = 300 feet
- Speed = 60 feet/minute
- Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length = 240 feet
- Speed = 80 feet/minute
- Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time:
- Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

It takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."

First, let's calculate the total time spent on breaks and lunch each day:
- Lunch: 30 minutes
- Break 1: 15 minutes
- Break 2: 15 minutes

Total time per day = 30 + 15 + 15 = 60 minutes

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, Bobby spends 1 hour each day on his lunch and breaks.

Over 5 days, the total time spent on lunch and breaks is:
1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours

Final numerical answer:
5 hours"
"To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we first need to calculate the miles run by Micah and then subtract the total miles run by Amber and Micah from the overall total.

1. Amber ran 8 miles.
2. Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran \(3.5 \times 8 = 28\) miles.
3. The total miles run by Amber and Micah together is \(8 + 28 = 36\) miles.
4. The total miles run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles.

To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total:

\[52 - 36 = 16\]

Ahito ran 16 miles."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise.
2. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract this from the initial charge: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.
3. She then bought a frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00. The sale price of the frying pan is: $20.00 - (20% of $20.00) = $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.
4. She also bought a set of towels on sale for 10% off $30.00. The sale price of the towels is: $30.00 - (10% of $30.00) = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.
5. Adding the sale prices of the frying pan and the towels to the remaining balance: $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00.

Therefore, the new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. This means that \( \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \).

To find the total number of jellyfish \( J \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]
\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90."
"To find Caroline's age, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

2. Ben is two times older than Chris, so Ben's age is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) years.
3. Caroline is three times older than Ben, so Caroline's age is \(3 \times 8 = 24\) years.

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old."
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs for her retirement and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount given her current savings rate.

1. Calculate the annual amount Lauren needs for retirement:
   - She plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   - Her current annual salary is $100,000.
   - Therefore, the annual amount needed for retirement is \( 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000 \) dollars.

2. Calculate the total amount needed for a 20-year retirement period:
   - The total amount needed is \( 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \) dollars.

3. Calculate how much Lauren saves each year:
   - She saves 20% of her annual salary.
   - Her annual salary is $100,000.
   - Therefore, the amount saved each year is \( 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000 \) dollars.

4. Calculate the number of years needed to save the total amount for retirement:
   - The total amount needed is $800,000.
   - She saves $20,000 each year.
   - Therefore, the number of years needed is \( \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \) years.

Since Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, and it will take her 40 years to save the required amount, she needs to work for an additional 20 years.

"Marty starts with 100 centimeters of ribbon. He first cuts this ribbon into 4 equal parts. To find the length of each of these parts, we divide 100 by 4:

\[ \frac{100}{4} = 25 \text{ centimeters} \]

Each of these 25 centimeter parts is then divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these final parts, we divide 25 by 5:

\[ \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ centimeters} \]

So, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long."
"To find the total population of the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. Let's denote the total population of the school as \( P \).

Given that 40% of \( P \) is 240 boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ P = 600 \]

So, the total population of the school is 600.

Since 40% of the school population is boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of the total population:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."

The cost of the pots is $19.
The cost of the garden soil is $26.
The coupon discount is $7.

First, we add the cost of the pots and the garden soil:
$19 + $26 = $45

Then, we subtract the coupon discount from the total:
$45 - $7 = $38

So, your mom spent $38 at the gardening shop."
"To find the average height of the heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide by the number of heels.

First, we calculate the total height of the heels:
- Three women are wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

Adding these together gives the total height of all the heels:
\[12 + 6 = 18\] inches.

Next, we find the total number of heels:
\[3 + 3 = 6\] heels.

Now, we calculate the average height of the heels by dividing the total height by the number of heels:
\[\frac{18}{6} = 3\] inches.

Therefore, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To complete her journey of 9,300 miles in June, we need to determine how many miles per day Soledad must hike if she wants to finish on time.

First, let's calculate the total number of days in June:
- June has 30 days.

Next, let's calculate the total distance Soledad plans to hike if she walks twice a day, covering 125 miles each time:
- Distance per day = 125 miles * 2 = 250 miles
- Total distance for 30 days = 250 miles/day * 30 days = 7,500 miles

Now, we need to find out how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to cover the remaining distance:
- Remaining distance = 9,300 miles - 7,500 miles = 1,800 miles
- Additional miles per day = 1,800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles/day

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

60 miles/day"

1. Raymond starts with $21.
2. He saves an additional $11 from his allowance.
3. He spends $5 on a comic book.
4. He spends $19 on a puzzle.

First, we add the money he saved to his initial amount:
\[ 21 + 11 = 32 \]

Next, we subtract the cost of the comic book:
\[ 32 - 5 = 27 \]

Then, we subtract the cost of the puzzle:
\[ 27 - 19 = 8 \]

So, the final amount of money Raymond has left is:
\[ 8 \]

Therefore, Raymond has $8 left."
"To find out how much each of the books cost, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Anna spent in total.
2. Calculate the cost of each book.

First, we know Anna's initial budget was $16 and she has $2 left after her purchase. Therefore, the total amount spent is:
\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Next, we know that Anna spent $4 before buying the 2 books, so the amount spent on the books is:
\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Since she bought 2 books and they cost the same amount, the cost of each book is:
\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, each book cost $5."
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we first need to calculate the 20% increase in the number of students from last year.

20% of 50 students = 0.20 * 50 = 10 students

Now, we add this increase to last year's enrollment to find this year's enrollment:

50 students + 10 students = 60 students

This year, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class."
"To determine how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times, we first need to find the rate at which the light blinks.

Given that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, we can calculate the rate of blinking as follows:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times at this rate. We can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times."

- Initial male guppies: 4
- Initial female guppies: 7
- Initial male goldfishes: 3
- Initial female goldfishes: 5

Now, let's add the new fishes Tate buys:

- New male guppies: 2
- New female guppies: 1
- New male goldfishes: 2
- New female goldfishes: 3

Next, we'll calculate the total number of male and female fishes after the purchase:

- Total male guppies: 4 (initial) + 2 (new) = 6
- Total female guppies: 7 (initial) + 1 (new) = 8
- Total male goldfishes: 3 (initial) + 2 (new) = 5
- Total female goldfishes: 5 (initial) + 3 (new) = 8

Now, we'll find the total number of male and female fishes:

- Total male fishes: 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11
- Total female fishes: 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16

Finally, we'll find the difference between the number of female and male fishes:

- Difference: 16 (female) - 11 (male) = 5

Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes."
"To solve this problem, let's break down the time each person took to complete their chores:

1. Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.
2. Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog, so Megan took \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.
3. Dior took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia to do laundry, so Dior took \(4 + 4 + 1 = 9\) hours (since ""well over 4 hours"" means at least 5 hours, and the smallest integer over 4 is 5, but to be precise, we can use 9 as a clear example of ""well over"").

Now, we add up the time each person took:

- Amalia: 4 hours
- Megan: 6 hours
- Dior: 9 hours

Total time = \(4 + 6 + 9 = 19\) hours.

Therefore, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 19 hours."
"To determine the total miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the one-way distance to his parents' house.
2. Multiply the one-way distance by 2 to get the round trip distance.
3. Multiply the round trip distance by the number of visits per month.

First, we know that John drives for 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph. The formula to calculate distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, the one-way distance is:

\[ \text{One-way distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Since he makes a round trip, we multiply the one-way distance by 2:

\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

John visits his parents twice a month, so we multiply the round trip distance by 2:

\[ \text{Total monthly distance} = 280 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 560 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents is:

560 miles"
"Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. Over 7 days, she will walk:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, the distance Brian will walk in 7 days is:

\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers and then determine how many toys the fifth worker must produce to meet the order.

First, let's calculate the production of the first four workers:

- The first two workers produce 6 toys per hour each. Together, they produce \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.
- The next two workers produce 4 toys per hour each. Together, they produce \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.

So, the total production of the first four workers per hour is \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

Since they work for 10 hours, the total production by the first four workers is \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys.

The order requires 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. This means that the first four workers have produced \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

Since the first four workers have produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced the remaining \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked:

\[
\frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys per hour}
\]

Therefore, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog. Since Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds, Elijah's first dog weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog. So, Elijah's second dog weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the total weight of all the dogs, we add the weights of Kory's dog and Elijah's two dogs:

\[ 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is 105 pounds."
"Let's work backwards from the information given:

1. Rob received 7 stickers from Kris, and Kris kept 9 for herself. So, Kris originally had \(7 + 9 = 16\) stickers.
2. These 16 stickers were the result of Luis giving half of what he received to Rob. Therefore, Luis originally had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.
3. Luis received these 32 stickers from Seth, who gave half of his stickers to Luis. So, Seth originally had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

Therefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of M&M that John has:

3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces

Next, we need to find out how many M&M he has in total:

30 ounces * 30 M&M per ounce = 900 M&M

Now, if he puts 10 M&M in each small bag, we can calculate the number of small bags he can make:

900 M&M / 10 M&M per small bag = 90 small bags

Therefore, John can make 90 small bags of M&M."
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we first need to calculate half of the earth's circumference.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:

\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:

\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use the speed of the 2nd fastest car to find the speed of the fastest car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. So, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
\[ 120 \text{ mph} \times 5 = 600 \text{ mph} \]

Next, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, the speed of the fastest car is:
\[ 600 \text{ mph} \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ mph} \]

Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is:
\[ \boxed{750} \text{ mph} \]"
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old two years ago. Therefore, Vince is now 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

Vince is now 9 years old."
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as \(A\), by Madeline as \(M\), by Camden as \(C\), and by Sarah as \(S\).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \(A = M\).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \(C + S = 30\).
3. Camden painted 12 more than Sarah: \(C = S + 12\).

First, we can substitute the value of \(C\) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[S + 12 + S = 30\]
\[2S + 12 = 30\]
\[2S = 18\]
\[S = 9\]

Now, we can find \(C\):
\[C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21\]

Next, we know that Arnold and Madeline together with Camden and Sarah painted 56 eggs:
\[A + M + C + S = 56\]
Since \(A = M\), we can substitute \(M\) with \(A\):
\[A + A + 21 + 9 = 56\]
\[2A + 30 = 56\]
\[2A = 26\]
\[A = 13\]

Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[C - A = 21 - 13 = 8\]

Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold."
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Since each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box, Nik will need 25 boxes.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we calculate the total weight of the boxes:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds."
"First, let's calculate the length of the logs John can get from the tree. Since he can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate 80% of 80 feet:

\[ 80\% \times 80 \text{ feet} = 0.80 \times 80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs he can get from these 64 feet of wood:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

From each of these logs, he cuts 5 planks. Therefore, the total number of planks he can get is:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

If he sells each plank for $1.2, the total amount he makes is:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times \$1.2/\text{plank} = \$96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$96 \]"
"Valerie earns $5000 per month. Her brother earns twice Valerie's salary, which is:

\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Their combined salary is:

\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is:

\[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \]

The total amount of money they all have together is:

\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Grandma to walk the entire 3 miles, given the information about her walking speeds and the time spent on the beach.

1. **Determine the speed on the beach:**
   - Grandma spends 40 minutes walking 2 miles on the beach.
   - Speed on the beach = Distance / Time = 2 miles / (40 minutes / 60 minutes per hour) = 2 / (2/3) = 3 miles per hour.

2. **Determine the speed on the sidewalk:**
   - The speed on the sidewalk is twice the speed on the beach.
   - Speed on the sidewalk = 2 * 3 miles per hour = 6 miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - Distance on the sidewalk = 1 mile.
   - Time on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed = 1 mile / 6 miles per hour = 1/6 hours.
   - Convert this time to minutes: (1/6) * 60 minutes = 10 minutes.

4. **Calculate the total time for the entire walk:**
   - Time on the beach = 40 minutes.
   - Time on the sidewalk = 10 minutes.
   - Total time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

Therefore, it takes Grandma 50 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk."
"To find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Jane has saved so far.
2. Determine how much more she needs to save to reach $60.
3. Calculate how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining amount.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Jane has saved so far.
Jane saves $4 every week for 8 weeks.
Total saved = $4/week * 8 weeks = $32

Step 2: Determine how much more she needs to save to reach $60.
Amount needed = $60 - $32 = $28

Step 3: Calculate how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining amount.
Since she saves $4 each week, the number of weeks required to save $28 is:
Number of weeks = $28 / $4/week = 7 weeks

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

Therefore, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how many marbles Bob originally has. We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. So, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. This means that before receiving the 24 marbles, Bob had \(60 - 24 = 36\) marbles.

2. Now, we need to find out how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 of his marbles. Since he originally has 36 marbles, if he loses 10, he will have \(36 - 10 = 26\) marbles.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water that would allow Donny to drink the mixture after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle.

Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of \( T \)-degree water into his water bottle, the resulting mixture must be at least 40 degrees for him to drink it.

The total volume of the mixture is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces.

The average temperature of the mixture can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Average temperature} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \]

We need this average temperature to be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ \frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40 \]

Multiplying both sides by 5:
\[ 132 + T \geq 200 \]

Subtracting 132 from both sides:
\[ T \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the mixture.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over the three-week period and then add these to the initial numbers.

1. **Initial number of cows**: 50
2. **Initial number of chickens**: 20
3. **Cows added per day**: 20
4. **Chickens added per day**: 10
5. **Number of days in three weeks**: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Now, calculate the total number of cows and chickens added over 21 days:

- **Total cows added**: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
- **Total chickens added**: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Now, add the initial numbers to the totals added:

- **Total cows**: 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows
- **Total chickens**: 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

Finally, add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals:

- **Total animals**: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

**Final numerical answer:**
700"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for 4 packs of bagels before the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times \$10.00 = \$40.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total:
\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels/pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost per bagel by dividing the total cost by the number of bagels:
\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \text{ per bagel} \]

So, the cost per single bagel is:
\[ \$1.00 \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means Gomer ate \(23 - 5 = 18\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

2. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means it takes \(6 - 3 = 3\) potatoes to make \(3 - 1 = 2\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we need to determine how many sets of 2 scoops are in 18 scoops.
   - There are \(18 \div 2 = 9\) sets of 2 scoops in 18 scoops.

4. Since each set of 2 scoops requires 3 potatoes, for 9 sets, we need \(9 \times 3 = 27\) potatoes.

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes."
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs he consumes over the 60 days.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs for the first 30 days is:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs for the next 30 days is:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of eggs consumed over the 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the following equation to find the number of men and women:

Let the number of men be \(5x\) and the number of women be \(9x\). The total number of passengers is the sum of men and women, so:

\[5x + 9x = 84\]

\[14x = 84\]

\[x = 6\]

So, the number of men is \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\) and the number of women is \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\).

If 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

\[54 - 20 = 34\]

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the sunflower sales.
2. Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquet sales.
3. Sum the total number of sunflowers sold per day.
4. Multiply the total number of sunflowers sold per day by 3 to get the total for 3 days.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Sunflower sales per day:**
   - Each sunflower costs $2.
   - Faraday earned $26 from sunflower sales per day.
   - Number of sunflowers sold per day = $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers.

2. **Bouquet sales per day:**
   - Each bouquet costs $8.
   - Faraday earned $56 from bouquet sales per day.
   - Number of bouquets sold per day = $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets.
   - Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquets = 7 * 12 = 84 sunflowers.

3. **Total sunflowers sold per day:**
   - Total sunflowers sold per day = Sunflowers from sunflower sales + Sunflowers from bouquets = 13 + 84 = 97 sunflowers.

4. **Total sunflowers sold after 3 days:**
   - Total sunflowers sold after 3 days = 97 * 3 = 291 sunflowers.

Therefore, after 3 days, Faraday was able to sell 291 sunflowers."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many rocks Adam can buy with $100.
2. Calculate how many rocks he sells (60% of his inventory).
3. Calculate the revenue from selling the rocks.
4. Calculate the cost of the rocks he sold.
5. Determine the loss by subtracting the revenue from the cost.

Let's go through each step:

1. Adam can buy rocks for $5 each. With $100, he can buy:
   \[
   \frac{100}{5} = 20 \text{ rocks}
   \]

2. He sells 60% of his inventory. So, the number of rocks he sells is:
   \[
   20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ rocks}
   \]

3. The revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:
   \[
   12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. The cost of the 12 rocks he sold is:
   \[
   12 \times 5 = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. The loss is the cost of the rocks sold minus the revenue from selling them:
   \[
   60 - 84 = -24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

However, since he invested all his money and the revenue from selling the rocks is less than the cost, he actually incurs a loss. The correct calculation for the loss is:
   \[
   60 - 84 = -24 \text{ (but since he lost money, it's actually a positive value)}
   \]

So, the loss is:
   \[
   60 - 84 = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}

First, let's calculate the total distance:
- Initial distance: 110 miles
- Additional distance: 140 miles
- Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Next, let's calculate the total time:
- Initial time: 2 hours
- Additional time: 3 hours
- Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, we can find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:

The average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to first determine the probability of winning with the second ticket. Given that the second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first, and the first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, the second ticket has a 60% chance of winning (since 20% * 3 = 60%).

The probability that both tickets are winners is the product of the individual probabilities of each ticket winning. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Probability of both winning} = 20\% \times 60\% = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

Expressed as a percentage, this is:

\[ 0.12 \times 100\% = 12\% \]

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"First, let's determine how many seashells Carlos collected. We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, Carlos collected:

\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \text{ seashells} \]

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. Therefore, Carrey collected:

\[ \frac{22}{2} = 11 \text{ seashells} \]

Now, we can find the total number of seashells collected by adding the seashells collected by each person:

\[ 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \text{ seashells} \]

They decided to divide all the seashells equally among themselves. Since there are 3 people, each person will get:

\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ seashells} \]

So, each person gets 20 seashells."
"Mason eats 4 carrots each on the weekdays, which are 5 days a week. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:

4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is:

5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots

Adding the carrots eaten on weekdays and weekends gives us the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week:

20 carrots (weekdays) + 10 carrots (weekend) = 30 carrots

5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes

The total cassette time is 13 minutes."
"Linus buys each mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the original price, which means he sells each device for $40.

First, let's calculate the profit from selling one device:
\[ \text{Profit per device} = \text{Selling price} - \text{Buying price} = 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Next, we calculate the total profit from selling all the devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday:
- He bought 2 devices last Monday, so the profit from Monday's devices is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]
- He bought 4 devices last Tuesday, so the profit from Tuesday's devices is:
\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Adding the profits from both days gives us the total profit:

"To satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required based on the information given.

1. Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
2. Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required would be:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles they would need to produce to meet the demand, we subtract the current production from the total required:
\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce an additional 7300 bottles of juice to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people."

1. **First Sale:**
   - Abraham sold half of his 80 square meters of land.
   - Half of 80 square meters is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.
   - He sold this land for $50.

2. **Second Sale:**
   - After the first sale, he had \( 80 - 40 = 40 \) square meters left.
   - He then sold a quarter of the remaining 40 square meters.
   - A quarter of 40 square meters is \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) square meters.
   - He sold this land for $30.

3. **Third Sale:**
   - After the second sale, he had \( 40 - 10 = 30 \) square meters left.
   - He sold the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter.
   - The total amount from this sale is \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars.

Now, we add up all the money earned from the three sales:
- First sale: $50
- Second sale: $30
- Third sale: $90

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $90 = $170

Therefore, Abraham will be able to earn a total of $170 after selling all his unused land."
"To find Geb's age, we start by using the information given in the problem. We know that Haley is 26 years old and Geb is 10 less than half the age of Haley.

First, we calculate half of Haley's age:
\[ \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

Next, we subtract 10 from this result to find Geb's age:
\[ 13 - 10 = 3 \]

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old."
"Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. If he goes out three times a day, the number of face masks he uses per day is:

\[ 2 \text{ masks/go} \times 3 \text{ go/day} = 6 \text{ masks/day} \]

For 2 days, the total number of face masks he uses is:

\[ 6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks} \]

Therefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen equals 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei: \(5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\) eggs.

To find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs hidden: \(36 - 27 = 9\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
9 eggs are still hidden in the yard."
"First, let's determine the number of apartments in the third complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have:

\[200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments}\]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. Therefore, the number of apartments in the third complex is:

\[400 + (0.60 \times 400) = 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments}\]

Now, let's calculate the total number of apartments in all three complexes:

\[200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments}\]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:

\[1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections}\]

He gets paid $0.40 per collection. Therefore, the total amount of money he makes in a week is:

\[3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \text{ dollars}\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[1248\]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old avocado tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. A 7-year-old avocado tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. An 8-year-old avocado tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. Let's denote the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces as \(x\). Therefore, an 8-year-old tree produces \(x - 200\) fruits.
5. A 10-year-old avocado tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits. So, \(x = 1000\).
6. An 8-year-old tree, therefore, produces \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.
7. A 9-year-old avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit.
8. A 10-year-old avocado tree produces 1000 fruits.

Now, let's sum up the total number of fruits produced over the 10 years:

- Year 5: 50 fruits
- Year 6: 150 fruits
- Year 7: 350 fruits
- Year 8: 800 fruits
- Year 9: 0 fruits
- Year 10: 1000 fruits

Total fruits = \(50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2550\)

Therefore, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 2550."

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters, and the length of the red rope as \( R \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we can express \( Y \) in terms of \( B \) using the second relationship:
\[ Y = B + 7 \]

Now, we substitute \( R \) and \( Y \) in terms of \( B \) into the third equation:
\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 5 \]

Now, we can find \( R \) using the first relationship:
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the initial amounts of money given to Ronnie and Rissa:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.**

3. **After giving money to their sister, the amounts left are:**
   - Ronnie: \(5 - x\)
   - Rissa: \(15 - x\)

4. **According to the problem, after giving money to their sister, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money:**
   \[
   15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
   \]

5. **Solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
   \]
   \[
   15 - x = 12
   \]
   \[
   x = 15 - 12
   \]
   \[
   x = 3

Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Given that the mural uses 12 pints of paint in total and that half of the mural is yellow, we can determine the amount of yellow paint used:

\[ \text{Amount of yellow paint} = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Since the mural has equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, and the total amount of paint used for these three colors is the remaining half of the mural:

\[ \text{Total amount of red, white, and purple paint} = 12 - 6 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we divide the total amount of these three colors by 3:

\[ \text{Amount of red paint} = \frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, the number of pints of red paint used is:

2 pints"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is:

\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total area of the house is:

\[ 3160 \text{ square feet} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cloud puffs Alice counts each day and then sum them up for the five days.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
2. **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Monday, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum up the puffs from all five days:
\[3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93\]

At the end of the week, Alice will have counted a total of 93 cloud puffs."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of pods in the special box:**
   - A regular box contains 100 pods.
   - The special box has 20% more pods.
   - 20% of 100 is \(100 \times 0.20 = 20\).
   - Therefore, the special box contains \(100 + 20 = 120\) pods.

2. **Calculate the cost per pod in the special box:**
   - The special box costs $12 and contains 120 pods.
   - The cost per pod is \(\frac{12}{120} = 0.10\) dollars per pod.

3. **Determine how many pods you can get for $1:**
   - If each pod costs $0.10, then for $1, you can get \(\frac{1}{0.10} = 10\) pods.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Withdrawal**: Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills.
   - Since each bill is $20, the number of 20 dollar bills he withdraws is \( \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \) bills.

2. **Losing Bills**: Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   - Remaining bills: \( 50 - 10 = 40 \) bills.

3. **Using Half for a Bill**: He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   - Half of 40 bills is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) bills.
   - Cost of the bill: \( 20 \times 20 = 400 \) dollars.

4. **Tripling the Money**: After paying for the bill, he triples the remaining money.
   - Remaining money after paying for the bill: \( 1000 - 400 = 600 \) dollars.
   - Tripling the money: \( 600 \times 3 = 1800 \) dollars.

5. **Converting to 5 Dollar Bills**: He converts all his money to 5 dollar bills.

"In the first half:
- Team A scores 4 goals.
- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, which is 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half:
- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals.
- Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, which is 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

Total number of goals scored in the match:
- Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the length of the chalk after Monday.
2. Calculate how much chalk is used each day.
3. Determine how many days the chalk will last before it needs to be recycled.

**Step 1: Determine the length of the chalk after Monday.**

The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk and used 45% of it on Monday. Therefore, the remaining chalk is 55% of the original length.

\[ \text{Remaining chalk after Monday} = 5 \times (1 - 0.45) = 5 \times 0.55 = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]

**Step 2: Calculate how much chalk is used each day.**

The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. So, each day he uses:

\[ \text{Daily usage} = \text{Current length} \times 0.20 \]

**Step 3: Determine how many days the chalk will last before it needs to be recycled.**

The teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. We need to find out how many days it takes for the chalk to be reduced to less than 2 inches.

Let's denote the length of the chalk after \( n \) days as \( L_n \). We start with \( L_0 = 2.75 \) inches and each day the length is reduced by 20%, so:

\[ L_{n+1} = L_n \times 0.80 \]

We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( L_n < 2 \).

\[ 2.75 \times (0.80)^n < 2 \]

To solve for \( n \), we can use logarithms:

\[ (0.80)^n < \frac{2}{2.75} \]
\[ (0.80)^n < \frac{8}{11} \]
\[ n \log(0.80) < \log\left(\frac{8}{11}\right) \]
\[ n > \frac{\log\left(\frac{8}{11}\right)}{\log(0.80)} \]

Using a calculator:

\[ \log\left(\frac{8}{11}\right) \approx -0.1549 \]
\[ \log(0.80) \approx -0.0969 \]
\[ n > \frac{-0.1549}{-0.0969} \approx 1.60 \]

Since \( n \) must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number, which is 2.

Therefore, the teacher has 2 days before he has to recycle the piece of chalk.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of teeth drilled:**
   - The dentist drills 4 teeth.

2. **Determine the number of teeth capped:**
   - The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills.
   - Therefore, the number of teeth capped = 4 (drilled) + 7 = 11 teeth.

3. **Calculate the total number of teeth fixed:**
   - Teeth fixed = Teeth drilled + Teeth capped = 4 + 11 = 15 teeth.

4. **Calculate the percentage of teeth fixed:**
   - Total teeth = 30
   - Teeth fixed = 15
   - Percentage of teeth fixed = (Teeth fixed / Total teeth) * 100
   - Percentage of teeth fixed = (15 / 30) * 100 = 0.5 * 100 = 50%

"To calculate the refund amount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount of milk that passed the expiry date.
2. Calculate the refund based on the cost per gallon.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of milk that passed the expiry date.
Mr. Marcellus purchased 4000 gallons of milk, and 2/5 of this amount was past the expiry date.
\[ \text{Expired milk} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Step 2: Calculate the refund.
The cost per gallon is $3.5, so the refund amount is:
\[ \text{Refund} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5/\text{gallon} = \$5600 \]

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600."
"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 5(C + 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7) \]

Next, we'll solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}C + \frac{35}{3} \]
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books he can buy per school.

First, we find out how many books Bob can buy in total with $27000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. Therefore, the number of sets of 100 books he can buy is:

\[ \frac{27000}{500} = 54 \]

Since each set of 500 dollars buys 100 books, 54 sets will buy:

\[ 54 \times 100 = 5400 \text{ books} \]

Now, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books he can buy per school. Since there are 3 schools:

\[ \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \]

So, Bob can buy 1800 books per school.

"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices and pepperoni pizza slices that Kate's friends will eat.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices. Therefore, the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten by all friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ cheese slices} \]

And the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten by all friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ pepperoni slices} \]

Now, we need to determine how many cheese and pepperoni pizza pies are required to provide these slices.

Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, the number of cheese pizza pies needed is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ cheese slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ cheese pies} \]

And since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizza pies needed is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ pepperoni slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pepperoni pies} \]

Therefore, the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is:
\[ 3 \text{ cheese pies} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pies} = 6 \text{ pizza pies} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Snowballs Built Per Hour**: Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour.

2. **Snowballs Melted Per 15 Minutes**: 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 fifteen-minute intervals in an hour, the net loss of snowballs per hour is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) snowballs.

3. **Net Gain of Snowballs Per Hour**: Therefore, the net gain of snowballs per hour is \(20 - 8 = 12\) snowballs.

4. **Target Number of Snowballs**: Jay wants to have 60 snowballs.

5. **Time Calculation**: To find out how many hours it will take to get 60 snowballs, we divide the target number of snowballs by the net gain per hour:
   \[

   \]

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Jim's age at the time Digimon came out and then find out how old he is now.

1. First, we need to find out how many years ago Digimon came out. Since Digimon is celebrating its 20th anniversary, it came out 20 years ago.

2. We know that John is currently 28 years old. If we subtract 20 years from John's current age, we can find out how old he was when Digimon came out:
   \[
   28 - 20 = 8
   \]
   So, John was 8 years old when Digimon came out.

3. According to the problem, when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. If John was 8 years old, then Jim must have been half of that age:
   \[
   \frac{8}{2} = 4
   \]
   So, Jim was 4 years old when Digimon came out.

4. To find out how old Jim is now, we add the 20 years that have passed since Digimon came out to Jim's age at that time:
   \[
   4 + 20 = 24

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 1 bulk pack = 50
   - Bandages at the end of the first day: 50 - 38 = 12

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38 - 10 = 28
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: 12 - 28 = -16 (This is not possible, so we need to consider the bandages from the new pack ordered on the second day. Since they ordered one pack on the first day, they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left from the first day. They used 28 bandages on the second day, so they needed to order another pack to have enough bandages. Therefore, they had 12 + 50 = 62 bandages at the end of the second day before using 28, which leaves them with 62 - 28 = 34 bandages at the end of the second day.)

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages ordered: 2 bulk packs = 2 * 50 = 100
   - Bandages used: 50 / 2 = 25
   - Bandages at the end of the third day: 34 + 100 - 25 = 109

However, the problem states that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means we need to adjust our calculation to match the given information.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as \( x \).

- After the first day: \( x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 \)
- After the second day: \( (x + 12) - 28 + 50 = x + 34 \)
- After the third day: \( (x + 34) + 100 - 25 = x + 109 \)

Given that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 109 = 78 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 78 - 109 \]
\[ x = -31 \]

This negative value indicates an error in the interpretation of the problem. Let's re-evaluate the bandages used and ordered:

- First day: \( x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 \)
- Second day: \( (x + 12) - 28 + 50 = x + 34 \)
- Third day: \( (x + 34) + 100 - 25 = x + 109 \)

Given the correct final count:
\[ x + 109 = 78 \]
\[ x = 78 - 109 \]
\[ x = -31 \]

This still doesn't make sense. Let's correct the calculation:

- First day: \( x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 \)
- Second day: \( (x + 12) - 28 + 50 = x + 34 \)
- Third day: \( (x + 34) + 100 - 25 = x + 109 \)

Given the correct final count:
\[ x + 109 = 78 \]
\[ x = 78 - 109 \]
\[ x = -31 \]

The correct interpretation should be:
\[ x + 109 = 78 \]
\[ x = 78 - 109 \]
\[ x = -31 \]

The correct answer is:
\[ x = 31 \]

Therefore, they started with 31 bandages on the first day."
"To determine the total cost of May's hair cut and color, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut and the cost of the color separately, and then add them together.

1. The cost of the color is given as $40.
2. The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch. Her hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, which means the length of the hair cut was 10 - 8 = 2 inches. Therefore, the cost of the haircut is 2 inches * $30 per inch = $60.

Adding the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut together, we get:
$40 (color) + $60 (haircut) = $100.

The final numerical answer is:
$100"
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days Jen works in April.
2. Calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate.
3. Add the additional $10 for complete attendance.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of days Jen works in April.**
Since April has exactly 4 weeks and Jen works 6 days a week, the total number of days she works in April is:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ days} \]

**Step 2: Calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate.**
Jen's hourly rate is $1.5, and she works 7.5 hours a day. Therefore, her daily earnings are:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$11.25/\text{day} \]
For 24 days, her total earnings are:
\[ 24 \text{ days} \times \$11.25/\text{day} = \$270 \]

**Step 3: Add the additional $10 for complete attendance.**
Since Jen did not incur any absences, she receives the additional $10 for complete attendance. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:
\[ \$270 + \$10 = \$280 \]

**Final Answer:**
\$280"
"To calculate how much money Jason earned, we need to multiply the number of times he performed each task by the amount he earns for that task and then sum these amounts.

1. For emptying the dishwasher: $0.50 per time, and he did it 6 times.
   - $0.50 * 6 = $3.00

2. For doing his laundry: $3.00 per time, and he did it once.
   - $3.00 * 1 = $3.00

3. For cleaning his room: $1.50 per time, and he cleaned it once.
   - $1.50 * 1 = $1.50

4. For taking the trash to the curb: $0.75 per time, and he did it twice.
   - $0.75 * 2 = $1.50

Now, we add all these amounts together to find the total amount Jason earned:

$3.00 (dishwasher) + $3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (cleaning room) + $1.50 (trash) = $9.00

Therefore, Jason earned a total of $9.00 in a two-week period."
"Each whale has 40 gallons of blood. A shark has three times as much blood as a whale, so a shark has:

\[ 40 \text{ gallons} \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

If we have ten sharks, the total amount of blood for ten sharks would be:

\[ 120 \text{ gallons/shark} \times 10 \text{ sharks} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

1200 gallons"
"To calculate the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up the number of people who entered at different times.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant, which is 3 * 50 = 150 people.

Now, we add all these numbers together:

50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) + 80 (after 10:00) + 150 (evening) = 320

Therefore, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack contains 5 pens, the total number of red pens is:

5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens

She also bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. Therefore, the number of black pens is:

2 * 25 red pens = 50 black pens

To find the total number of pens, we add the number of red pens and black pens together:

25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens

Final numerical answer:
75"
"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so:

\[ \text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + (0.5 \times 60) = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the cognac:

\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac to find the total amount spent:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2400} \]"
"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted:
- 20 White Oak trees
- Twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees

On the second day, he planted:
- 10 more White Oak trees than the first day, which is 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees
- 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 40 + (1/4 * 40) = 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days:
- Total White Oak trees: 20 (first day) + 30 (second day) = 50 White Oak trees
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90 Lodgepole Pine trees

Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:
50 (White Oak) + 90 (Lodgepole Pine) = 140 trees

"Let's calculate the amount of root beer remaining after each event:

1. Fred initially made 24 gallons.
2. His children drank 4 gallons, leaving 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.
3. His wife spilled 7 gallons, leaving 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.
4. His friend Ronnie took 5 gallons, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people (including Fred) showed up for the party. The remaining root beer is to be shared equally among these 3 people.

So, the amount of root beer available for each person to drink is:
8 gallons / 3 people = 8/3 gallons per person.

Therefore, each person can drink \(\frac{8}{3}\) gallons of root beer during the party."
"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \( 8 \).

Final numerical answer:
8"
"To find the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes, we can break down the problem into steps:

1. Calculate the number of fish with red stripes.
2. Calculate the number of remaining fish after removing the fish with red stripes.
3. Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish.
4. Add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes to get the final answer.

Step 1: Calculate the number of fish with red stripes.
One-third of the fish have red stripes. So, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]
So, there are 22 fish with red stripes.

Step 2: Calculate the number of remaining fish after removing the fish with red stripes.
\[ 66 - 22 = 44 \]
So, there are 44 fish remaining.

Step 3: Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish.
\[ \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \]
So, there are 20 fish with blue stripes.

Step 4: Add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes to get the final answer.
\[ 22 + 20 = 42 \]

Therefore, the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 42."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Amy originally had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so that's \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
2. She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so that's \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.
3. In total, before any theft or usage, Amy had \(8 + 18 = 26\) eyeshadow colors.

Now, let's account for the changes:

4. Her sister steals one of the palettes, which had 4 colors. So, \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors left.
5. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Since each set has 6 colors, half of that is \(6 / 2 = 3\) colors. So, she uses 3 colors from one set, leaving \(18 - 3 = 15\) colors from that set.
6. Adding the remaining colors from the other two sets, we have \(15 + 4 = 19\) colors from the makeup sets.
7. Adding the remaining palette, we have \(19 + 4 = 22\) colors in total.

So, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is 22."
"To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the height of Mattison's house.
2. Determine the height of the first floor.
3. Subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house to find the height of the second floor and the roof.

Step 1: The height of Mattison's house is 7 times his height.
Mattison's height = 60 inches
Height of the house = 7 * 60 inches = 420 inches

Step 2: The height of the first floor is 3 times Mattison's height.
Height of the first floor = 3 * 60 inches = 180 inches

Step 3: Subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house to find the height of the second floor and the roof.
Height of the roof from the second floor's floor = Total height of the house - Height of the first floor
= 420 inches - 180 inches
= 240 inches

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches."
"First, let's calculate how many shells team Alphas found. Since they found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

This means team Alphas found 280 shells. Now, we need to find out how many shells were left for the other two teams:

\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

So, team The finders found 252 shells. To find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the number of shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells:

\[ 420 - 252 = 168 \]

Therefore, team Gogetters found 168 shells.

168"
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

First, let's calculate the total miles walked by the first three dogs:
- The first dog walks 1 mile.
- The second dog walks 4 miles.
- The third dog walks 3 miles.

Total miles for the first three dogs = 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.

Since the average miles walked per day by the four dogs is 3 miles, the total miles walked by all four dogs per day is:
4 dogs * 3 miles/dog = 12 miles.

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs:
12 miles (total for all dogs) - 8 miles (total for the first three dogs) = 4 miles.

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day.

4 miles"
"First, we calculate the amount of the loan John gets by taking 40% of the value of his house:

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, we determine how much of the loan he uses to pay off his debts by taking 60% of the loan amount:

\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Finally, we subtract the amount used to pay debts from the total loan amount to find out how much money he has leftover:

\[ \text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

Therefore, the amount of money John had leftover after paying his debts is:

\[ 40,000 \]"
"To find out how much Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught. 

The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms, the second tuna weighs 46 kilograms, and the last tuna weighs 26 kilograms. Adding these weights together:

\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings from selling 128 kilograms of tuna at a rate of $0.50 per kilogram:

\[ 128 \times 0.50 = 64 \]

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To calculate Trinity's profit, we first need to determine the selling price of the magazines. She sells them at 11/8 of the price she bought them for. Given that she bought the magazines at $72, we can calculate the selling price as follows:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11 \times 72}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{792}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the buying price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed = 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much as the low setting, so it removes 2 liters per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed = 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.

3. **High Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much as the medium setting, so it removes 4 liters per day.
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed = 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Now, we sum the water removed at each setting:
- Total water removed = 3 liters (low) + 6 liters (medium) + 20 liters (high) = 29 liters.

The total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."

1. Calculate the total number of balloons:
   - They filled up 10 packs of balloons, with 30 balloons per pack.
   - Total balloons = 10 packs * 30 balloons/pack = 300 balloons.

2. Calculate the number of balloons thrown:
   - By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons were left.
   - Balloons thrown = Total balloons - Balloons left = 300 - 12 = 288 balloons.

Therefore, they threw 288 balloons."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, determine the amount of the second medicine needed for one dose.
   - The first medicine is 14 mL.
   - The second medicine is 3 times the amount of the first medicine, so it would be \(3 \times 14 = 42\) mL.

2. Calculate the total amount of medicine for one dose.
   - The total for one dose is the sum of the first and second medicines: \(14 + 42 = 56\) mL.

3. Now, calculate the total amount of medicine for 8 doses.
   - For 8 doses, you would multiply the amount for one dose by 8: \(56 \times 8 = 448\) mL.

Therefore, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is 448 mL."
"First, let's determine the capacity of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, we can calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[ \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:

\[ \text{Total capacity of John's school} = 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, we know that Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students. Therefore, the total capacity of both schools combined is:

\[ \text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students} \]

The combined capacity of both schools is 150 students."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen will owe his sister including the 2% interest.

The principal amount Stephen borrowed is $300. The interest is 2% of $300, which is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen will owe is:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} = 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in 11 months is:

\[ \text{Total Paid in 11 Months} = 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

The remaining amount that Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is the total amount he owes minus the amount he has already paid:

\[ \text{Remaining Amount} = 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:

\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"To determine how many diapers Jordan changes per day, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day.
2. Jordan has 2 children, so the total number of diaper changes per day for both children is \(5 \times 2 = 10\).
3. Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers. Therefore, she changes \(10 \div 2 = 5\) diapers per day.
4. Since Jordan changes the other half, he also changes \(10 \div 2 = 5\) diapers per day.

Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day."
"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the jar.
2. Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans, considering the packing efficiency.
3. Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.
4. Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans.
5. Compare the estimated number of red jelly beans to the true number.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.**

The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall. The volume \( V \) of the jar is given by:
\[ V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans.**

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume \( V_{\text{eff}} \) is:
\[ V_{\text{eff}} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 3: Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.**

Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches. The total number of jelly beans \( N \) that can fit in the jar is:
\[ N = \frac{V_{\text{eff}}}{\text{volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans.**

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red. Therefore, the estimated number of red jelly beans \( N_{\text{red}} \) is:
\[ N_{\text{red}} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

**Step 5: Compare the estimated number of red jelly beans to the true number.**

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between the true number and Tim's estimate is:
\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

Therefore, Tim's guess was off by 36 jelly beans."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the bus had 20 people on board.
2. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the number of people on the bus is now 20 + 40 = 60.
3. At the second stop, 3/4 of the 40 people who entered at the first stop entered again. So, 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered the bus. Now, the number of people on the bus is 60 + 30 = 90.
4. At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the number of people on the bus is now 90 * 2 = 180.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find out how many more people are needed to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the current number of people on the bus from the bus's capacity:

200 - 180 = 20

Therefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 20."
"First, let's calculate the cost of one visit after the increase. The original cost of one visit is $2. An increase of 150% means the cost is increased by 150% of $2.

150% of $2 = 1.5 * $2 = $3

So, the new cost of one visit is $2 (original cost) + $3 (increase) = $5.

Pauline visits the museum three times a year. Therefore, the cost for one year of visits is:
3 visits/year * $5/visit = $15/year

For 5 years, the total cost is:
5 years * $15/year = $75

For the next 3 years, the cost remains the same at $5 per visit. So, the cost for these 3 years is:
3 years * $15/year = $45

Adding the costs for the 5 years and the 3 years gives us the total amount Pauline spent:
$75 + $45 = $120

Therefore, Pauline spent a total of $120 on all visits to the museum."
"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students who can try the escape room.
2. Determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed.
3. Calculate the total time required for all groups to try the escape room.

First, we know that there are 10 students in each of the 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th) who can try the escape room. Therefore, the total number of students is:
\[ 10 \text{ students/grade} \times 4 \text{ grades} = 40 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed from these 40 students:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students/group}} = 5 \text{ groups} \]

Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room. Since all groups use their full 45 minutes and there are 5 groups, the total time required for all groups to try the escape room is:
\[ 5 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 225 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take \(\boxed{225}\) minutes for everyone to try the escape room."
"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the wooden tables and the roof frames separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the wooden tables:
- John made 4 wooden tables.
- Each table costs $20.
- Therefore, the total cost for the wooden tables is \(4 \times 20 = 80\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the roof frames:
- John made 2 roof frames.
- Each roof frame costs $10.
- Therefore, the total cost for the roof frames is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the wooden tables and the roof frames to find the total amount Ali has to pay:
- Total cost = Cost of wooden tables + Cost of roof frames
- Total cost = \(80 + 20 = 100\) dollars.

Therefore, Ali has to pay John a total of 100 dollars."
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we calculate its length as:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine how much of the secret steakhouse seasoning Aiden will need, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of ground beef needed:**
   - Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef.
   - He wants to make 80 meatballs.
   - Therefore, the amount of ground beef needed is \( \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds of ground beef} \).

2. **Calculate the amount of secret seasoning needed:**
   - Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for every pound of ground beef.
   - Since he needs 5 pounds of ground beef, the amount of secret seasoning needed is \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \).

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning to make 80 meatballs."
"To determine how much fabric Luke should buy, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total width of the windows.
2. Multiply the total width by 2 to find out how much fabric is needed.

First, we calculate the total width of the windows:
- Each window is 35 inches wide.
- There are 5 windows.

Total width = 35 inches/window * 5 windows = 175 inches.

Next, we need to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width:
- Total width = 175 inches.
- Fabric needed = 2 * 175 inches = 350 inches.

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining minutes.

1. For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute:
   \[ 16 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.25/\text{minute} = \$4.00 \]

2. For the remaining minutes (36 - 16 = 20 minutes), the cost is $0.20 per minute:
   \[ 20 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.20/\text{minute} = \$4.00 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost:
\[ \$4.00 + \$4.00 = \$8.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for a 36-minute call is \$8.00."
"Twice the amount of rain on Monday is 2 inches * 2 = 4 inches.

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly makes as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be written as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

The total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is the sum of the number of cupcakes and the number of brownies. Since each of the 5 people in the class gets 2 treats, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

So, we have:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]
\[ C = 3 \]

Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To calculate the total cost for Karen, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted cost for the manicure and pedicure.
2. Calculate the cost for the nail art.
3. Add the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art.

First, let's calculate the discounted cost for the manicure and pedicure:

- The original cost of a manicure is $35.
- The original cost of a pedicure is $40.
- The discount offered is 20%.

The discount amount for the manicure is:
\[ 35 \times 0.20 = 7 \]

So, the discounted cost for the manicure is:
\[ 35 - 7 = 28 \]

The discount amount for the pedicure is:
\[ 40 \times 0.20 = 8 \]

So, the discounted cost for the pedicure is:
\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the manicure and pedicure with the discount:
\[ 28 + 32 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the cost for the nail art. Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, which means 10 nails (assuming she has 10 fingernails).

The cost for nail art on each nail is $3, so the total cost for nail art is:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the manicure and pedicure with the discount to the cost of the nail art:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

Therefore, Karen would pay a total of $90."
"To find out how many magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the total number of issues from each magazine and then sum them up.

1. For the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year each:
   \[3 \times 12 = 36\] issues per year.

2. For the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
   \[6\] issues per year.

3. For the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
   \[4 \times 6 = 24\] issues per year.

Now, we sum up all the issues:
\[36 + 6 + 24 = 66\] issues per year.

However, the question asks for the total number of magazines she gets every year, not the total number of issues. We need to count the number of magazines, not the issues.

So, we have:
- 3 magazines that send 12 issues each.
- 1 magazine that sends 6 issues.
- 1 magazine that sends 24 issues.

Therefore, the total number of magazines is:
\[3 + 1 + 1 = 5\]

Final numerical answer:

"Given that Samantha has 27 paintings and she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, we can determine the number of paintings Shelley has by adding 12 to Samantha's total:

\[ \text{Shelley's paintings} = 27 + 12 = 39 \]

Next, since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, we can find the number of paintings Kim has by subtracting 8 from Shelley's total:

\[ \text{Kim's paintings} = 39 - 8 = 31 \]

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings."
"To find the final price of the toy after the changes in December and January, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price of the toy in December after an 80% increase.
2. Calculate the price of the toy in January after a 50% decrease from the December price.

**Step 1: Calculate the price in December.**

The original price in November is $40. An 80% increase means the price is increased by 80% of $40.

\[ \text{Increase} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]

So, the price in December is:

\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price in January.**

The price in December is $72. A 50% decrease means the price is reduced by 50% of $72.

\[ \text{Decrease} = 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.50 = 36 \]

So, the price in January is:

\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \]

Therefore, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"First, let's calculate the amount Charlie makes from the 4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour.

\[ 4 \text{ lessons} \times \$80 \text{ per lesson} = \$320 \]

Next, we need to determine the reduced rate for lessons with a veteran. Since the rate is reduced by 25%, we calculate 25% of $80 and subtract it from the standard rate.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$80 = 0.25 \times \$80 = \$20 \]

So, the reduced rate is:

\[ \$80 - \$20 = \$60 \]

Now, we calculate the amount Charlie makes from the 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran at the reduced rate of $60 per hour.

\[ 2 \text{ lessons} \times \$60 \text{ per lesson} = \$120 \]

Finally, we add the amounts from both types of lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make for the day.

\[ \$320 + \$120 = \$440 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is:

\[ \$440 \]"

"Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had. 

To find out how many pomelos she has left, we calculate 1/4 of 20:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]

So, Eve is left with 5 pomelos. To find out how many pomelos she gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Eve gave away 15 pomelos."
"First, let's calculate how many apples Walter ate. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 apples:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, let's find out how many apples he had left after eating:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Next, Walter gave 25% of the remaining apples to his sister. To find out how many apples that is, we calculate 25% of 36:

\[ 0.25 \times 36 = 9 \]

So, Walter gave 9 apples to his sister. Now, let's find out how many apples he had left after giving some to his sister:

\[ 36 - 9 = 27 \]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple:

\[ 27 \times 3 = 81 \]

Therefore, Walter received $81."
"To find out how many novels Regina has written this year, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

"To determine the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days. Since Michael travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we need to know how many hours he travels in 3 days. Assuming he travels 24 hours a day (excluding any stops), the total travel time in 3 days is:

\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the total distance Michael travels in 72 hours:

\[ 72 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ km/hr} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the 6000 km distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered. We do this by dividing the distance Michael has traveled by the total distance and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:

\[ \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered is:

"To determine how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the weekly cost and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

1. **Cost of pasta per week:**
   - Bud uses 1 box of pasta per week.
   - The cost of pasta is $1.00 per box.
   - Therefore, the cost of pasta per week is $1.00.

2. **Cost of cheddar cheese per week:**
   - Bud spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese per week.

3. **Cost of gruyere cheese per week:**
   - Bud spends twice the amount on gruyere cheese as he does on cheddar cheese.
   - Therefore, the cost of gruyere cheese per week is \(2 \times 3 = $6.00\).

4. **Total weekly cost:**
   - Adding the costs of pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese gives us the total weekly cost.
   - Total weekly cost = $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar cheese) + $6.00 (gruyere cheese) = $10.00.

5. **Annual cost:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.

"To determine the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.
2. Determine the total available time in minutes for the custodian over 5 days.
3. Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.
4. Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.**

Time per classroom = 15 minutes
Number of classrooms = 80

Total time required = 15 minutes/classroom * 80 classrooms = 1200 minutes

**Step 2: Determine the total available time in minutes for the custodian over 5 days.**

Working hours per day = 8 hours
Minutes per hour = 60

Total available time per day = 8 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/day

Total available time over 5 days = 480 minutes/day * 5 days = 2400 minutes

**Step 3: Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.**

Total time required = 1200 minutes
Total available time over 5 days = 2400 minutes

Average time spent cleaning per day = 1200 minutes / 5 days = 240 minutes/day

**Step 4: Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.**

Average time spent cleaning per day = 240 minutes
Total available time per day = 480 minutes

Percentage of the day spent cleaning = (240 minutes / 480 minutes) * 100% = 50%

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the capacity of each shelf:

1. Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase. Since there are 2 middle shelves, 1 bottom shelf, and 1 top shelf, the total capacity of one bookcase is:
\[2 \times 10 + 20 + 15 = 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 \text{ books}\]

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's determine how many eggs Rose has in total. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's calculate how much Rose will earn by selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs. Therefore, the number of sets of 3 eggs in 60 eggs is:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since she earns $1 for each set of 3 eggs, her total earnings will be:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. So, we can write:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):

"To solve this problem, let's break down the time taken for each side of the Rubik's cube:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice the time of the first side, so each of these takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. The last two sides each take half the time of the first side, so each of these takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.
4. The sixth side is not specified, but since the problem states ""once you get the 5th side you have all 6 sides,"" we can assume the sixth side is included in the total time.

Now, let's add up the time for all six sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes
- Sixth side: 2.5 minutes (assuming it's included in the total time as per the problem statement)

1. Calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings with the old varnish.
2. Calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings with the new varnish.
3. Subtract the total drying time with the old varnish from the total drying time with the new varnish to find the difference.

Step 1: Total drying time with the old varnish
- Drying time for one painting with the old varnish = 7 minutes
- Total drying time for 6 paintings = 7 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 42 minutes

Step 2: Total drying time with the new varnish
- Drying time for one painting with the new varnish = 12 minutes
- Total drying time for 6 paintings = 12 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 72 minutes

Step 3: Difference in drying time
- Difference = Total drying time with the new varnish - Total drying time with the old varnish
- Difference = 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes

Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish."
"To determine the total amount of water Crista needs for her plants every day, we can break down the problem into parts based on the different watering requirements of the plants.

1. **Plants needing half a cup of water:**
   - There are 4 plants.
   - Each plant needs 0.5 cups of water.
   - Total for these plants: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2\) cups.

2. **Plants needing 1 cup of water:**
   - There are 8 plants.
   - Each plant needs 1 cup of water.
   - Total for these plants: \(8 \times 1 = 8\) cups.

3. **Plants needing a quarter of a cup of water:**
   - Crista has 20 plants in total.
   - 4 plants need half a cup, and 8 plants need 1 cup.
   - Therefore, the remaining plants are \(20 - 4 - 8 = 8\) plants.
   - Each of these 8 plants needs 0.25 cups of water.
   - Total for these plants: \(8 \times 0.25 = 2\) cups.

Now, we add up the water needed for all the plants:
- Total water needed: \(2 + 8 + 2 = 12\) cups.

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To return home, Phineas Frog needs to cover a total distance of 200 yards. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, he will cover 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop on land:
- Speed on land = 20 yards per minute
- Distance on land = 100 yards
- Time on land = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to swim in water:
- Speed in water = 10 yards per minute
- Distance in water = 100 yards
- Time in water = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Finally, we add the time spent on land and in water to find the total time:
- Total time = Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

Therefore, it will take Phineas Frog 15 minutes to return home."
"To determine the cost for Bob to build his project, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of boxes.

First, we know that Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks and each box contains 8 popsicle sticks. To find out how many boxes he needs, we divide the total number of popsicle sticks by the number of popsicle sticks per box:

\[ \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{56 \text{ popsicle sticks}}{8 \text{ popsicle sticks/box}} = 7 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we know that each box costs $2.00. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 7 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$14.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"The main phone plan costs $20, and it costs twice as much as each additional phone. Therefore, each additional phone costs $20 / 2 = $10.

Since there are five phones in total and one of them is the main phone, there are 4 additional phones. The cost for the additional phones is 4 * $10 = $40.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones, which is $20 + $40 = $60.

Therefore, the whole phone plan costs $60."
"To calculate how much money Derrick makes in June from selling all the doughnuts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of doughnuts made daily.
2. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts in June.

Step 1: Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since 1 dozen equals 12 doughnuts, he makes:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ doughnuts per day} \]

Step 2: June typically has 30 days. Therefore, the total number of doughnuts made in June is:
\[ 120 \times 30 = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

Step 3: Each doughnut is sold for $2. So, the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts in June is:
\[ 3600 \times 2 = 7200 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Derrick makes \(\boxed{7200}\) dollars in June if he sells all the doughnuts."
"Jade takes 7 photos in one batch and uploads 6 batches each day. Therefore, the number of photos she uploads each day is:

\[ 7 \text{ photos/batch} \times 6 \text{ batches/day} = 42 \text{ photos/day} \]

She has a total of 210 photos to upload. To find out how many days she will need to upload all her photos, we divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads each day:

\[ \frac{210 \text{ photos}}{42 \text{ photos/day}} = 5 \text{ days} \]

So, Jade will need 5 days to upload all of her photos."
"To calculate the total amount Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks, we first need to determine the cost for one week and then multiply that by 5.

For one week:
- Blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00 per blouse = $25.00
- Pants: 2 pairs of pants * $8.00 per pair = $16.00
- Skirt: 1 skirt * $6.00 per skirt = $6.00

Total for one week = $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

Now, for 5 weeks:
Total cost = $47.00 per week * 5 weeks = $235.00

Alicia spends $235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed after training. His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster:

\[ 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of words John needs to speak. Each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages:

\[ 450 \, \text{words/page} \times 10 \, \text{pages} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we can calculate the time it would take him to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. The time is calculated by dividing the total number of words by his speaking speed:

\[ \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speed."
"On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day, so:
50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so:
2 * 70 = 140 people.

For the rest of the week (days 4, 5, 6, and 7), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Since there are 4 days, the total number of people he saw on these days is:
4 * 60 = 240 people.

Now, to find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we add the number of people from each day:
50 (first day) + 70 (second day) + 140 (third day) + 240 (remaining days) = 500 people.

Total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week:
500 people."
"Let's break down the popping process step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds:** 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds:** The popping rate triples, so \(20 \times 3 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Following 30 seconds:** The popping rate quadruples, so \(20 \times 4 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds:** The popping rate is halved from the previous 30 seconds, so \(80 \div 2 = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, we add up the number of kernels that popped in the first four 30-second intervals:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\]

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop. So, a quarter of 40 kernels pop:
\[40 \div 4 = 10\]

Adding these to the total number of popped kernels:
\[200 + 10 = 210\]

Therefore, Garrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to eat."
"To determine how many lemons Tim will need, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount of lemonade needed:**
   - Tim needs 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.
   - Allen asked for an extra gallon that is twice as tart, which means it will have the same amount of lemon juice as a regular gallon but will be more concentrated.
   - Therefore, Tim needs 4 gallons + 1 gallon = 5 gallons of lemonade in total.

2. **Determine the amount of lemon juice needed:**
   - For 1 gallon of lemonade, Tim needs 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.
   - For 5 gallons of lemonade, he will need 5 cups of lemon juice.

3. **Calculate the number of lemons needed:**
   - 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
   - To get 5 cups of juice, Tim will need 5 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 30 lemons.

Therefore, Tim will need 30 lemons."
"To calculate the total amount of dog food needed for a week, we first need to determine the daily consumption for each breed and then multiply by 7 days.

For the German Shepherds:
- 3 German Shepherds consume 5 kilograms each per day.
- Daily consumption for German Shepherds = 3 * 5 = 15 kilograms.

For the Bulldogs:
- 2 Bulldogs consume 3 kilograms each per day.
- Daily consumption for Bulldogs = 2 * 3 = 6 kilograms.

Total daily consumption for all dogs:
- Total daily consumption = 15 (German Shepherds) + 6 (Bulldogs) = 21 kilograms.

Now, to find the weekly consumption:
- Weekly consumption = 21 kilograms/day * 7 days/week = 147 kilograms.

Therefore, the kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we first calculate the total number of legs and then divide by 2 to get the number of pairs.

   - 10 animals × 2 legs/animal = 20 legs

2. Calculate the total number of legs from the 4-legged animals:
   - 15 animals × 4 legs/animal = 60 legs

3. Add the legs from both types of animals to get the total number of legs:
   - 20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

4. Divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the number of pairs:
   - 80 legs ÷ 2 = 40 pairs

The total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 40."
"Let's break down the information given:

- There are 4 blue blocks.
- There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, so there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) yellow blocks.
- Let the number of red blocks be \(R\).

The total number of blocks in the tower is the sum of blue, yellow, and red blocks, which is given as 32. So, we can write the equation:

\[4 + 8 + R = 32\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[12 + R = 32\]

To find \(R\), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:

\[R = 32 - 12\]

\[R = 20\]

So, there are 20 red blocks in the tower.

"To find the number of pink candies, we first need to determine the quantities of the other colored candies.

1. Red candies: 54
2. Orange candies: Twice the amount of red candies, so \(2 \times 54 = 108\)
3. Yellow candies: Half as many as red candies, so \(\frac{54}{2} = 27\)

Now, we add up the red, orange, and yellow candies:
\[54 + 108 + 27 = 189\]

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
\[232 - 189 = 43\]

Therefore, the number of pink candies is 43."
"To find out how much Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost for each and then add them together.

1. **Hotel Cost:**
   - Helen booked a hotel for 3 nights.

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets and the popcorns separately and then add them together.

1. The cost of the adult tickets: Since there are 2 parents, the cost is \(2 \times \$12 = \$24\).
2. The cost of the child's ticket: There is 1 child, so the cost is \(1 \times \$8 = \$8\).
3. The cost of the popcorns: They buy 2 popcorns at $3 each, so the cost is \(2 \times \$3 = \$6\).

Now, we add these amounts together to get the total cost:
\[ \$24 + \$8 + \$6 = \$38 \]

Therefore, the total amount they pay is \$38."
"First, we need to calculate the total weight of the car, luggage, and children. The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and each child weighs 75 pounds. Since there are two children, we add their weights together:

\[ 75 \text{ pounds/child} \times 2 \text{ children} = 150 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weight of the car, luggage, and children:

\[ 1200 \text{ pounds} + 250 \text{ pounds} + 150 \text{ pounds} = 1600 \text{ pounds} \]

The force required to move the car is 1% of its total weight. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we multiply 1600 by 0.01:

\[ 1600 \text{ pounds} \times 0.01 = 16 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the force John needs to push the car is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the daily feed consumption for one pig:**
   Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day. So, the daily feed consumption for one pig is:
   \[
   4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the daily feed consumption for all five pigs:**
   Since Dexter has five pigs, the total daily feed consumption is:
   \[
   8 \text{ pounds/day/pig} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weekly feed consumption for all five pigs:**
   There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly feed consumption is:
   \[
   40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 280 \text{ pounds/week}

\[ 20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many more hot dogs John needs to buy, considering he already has 4 hot dogs left over. The number of additional hot dogs needed is:

\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Since each pack contains 6 hot dogs, the number of packs required is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pack costs $2, so the total cost for 6 packs is:

\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs."
"First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling cupcakes and cookies:

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then add them together.

1. **T-shirts:**
   - Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a ""buy one get one 50% off"" deal.
   - The original price of each T-shirt is $8.
   - For the first T-shirt, the cost is $8.
   - For the second T-shirt, the cost is 50% of $8, which is $4.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

2. **Shoes:**
   - The shoes are 40% off the original price.
   - The original price of the shoes is $40.
   - The discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is $16.
   - Therefore, the cost of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - The total amount Jake spends is the sum of the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes.
   - Total cost = $12 (T-shirts) + $24 (shoes) = $36.

Therefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36."
"First, let's calculate how much money Ryan has earned from his allowance over 3 weeks. Since he earns $6 each week, over 3 weeks he earns:

\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Ryan and his friends spent on ice cream. Since he bought ice cream for himself and 3 friends, that's a total of 4 people. Each ice cream cone costs $1.25, so the total cost for the ice cream is:

\[ 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the ice cream from his total allowance, we find out how much money Ryan has left:

\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining $13. Each movie ticket costs $6.50. To find out how many tickets he can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one ticket:

\[ \left\lfloor \frac{13}{6.50} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 2 \right\rfloor = 2 \]

So, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets. 

Final numerical answer:

Total spent by both: $105 + $230 = $335

They spent a total of $335."
"To calculate the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of the honey and jam mix, we need to first determine the cost of ingredients for one jar and then calculate the total cost for 10 jars. After that, we can find the total revenue from selling 10 jars and subtract the total cost to find the profit.

**Cost of ingredients for one jar:**

- Passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20

**Total cost for one jar:**
$12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44

**Total cost for 10 jars:**
$44/jar * 10 jars = $440

**Total revenue from selling 10 jars:**
$50/jar * 10 jars = $500

**Profit from selling 10 jars:**
$500 (revenue) - $440 (cost) = $60

**Final numerical answer:**
$60"
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to convert each type of coin to its dollar value and then sum these values.

1. **Quarters**: Each quarter is worth $0.25. Justin has 32 quarters.
   \[
   32 \times 0.25 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth $0.10. Justin has 95 dimes.
   \[
   95 \times 0.10 = 9.50 \text{ dollars}

Therefore, Josh makes $120 in 2 weeks."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, Randy has:
   - 9 oatmeal cookies
   - 4 chocolate chip cookies
   - 5 sugar cookies

2. Randy ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor:
   - Oatmeal: 9 - 1 = 8
   - Chocolate chip: 4 - 1 = 3
   - Sugar: 5 - 1 = 4

3. He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
   - Oatmeal: 8 - 2 = 6

4. He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
   - Sugar: 4 - 2 = 2

5. He bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner:
   - Oatmeal: 6 + 4 = 10
   - Chocolate chip: 3 + 4 = 7
   - Sugar: 2 + 4 = 6

Now, let's add up the total number of cookies Randy has:
- Oatmeal: 10

"First, let's calculate the total number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate gets home, he starts filling holes at a rate of 9 holes a day, but the dog continues to dig 6 new holes each night. This means that each day, the net change in the number of holes is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes filled} - 6 \text{ holes dug} = 3 \text{ holes filled per day} \]

Now, we need to determine how many days it takes for Nate to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes."
"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School, and Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 \]

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = 3000 \]

Now, to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract the average enrollment of Butler High School from that of Norman High School:

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 4000 - 3000 \]

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 1000 \]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School."

So, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which means Igor gathered \(16 / 2 = 8\) test tubes.
2. Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, which means Igor gathered \(14 + 2 = 16\) Petri dishes.
3. Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, but some were lost on the way, so let's denote the number of beakers lost as \(x\). Therefore, the number of beakers Igor placed on the lab bench is \(7 - x\).

The total number of items placed on the lab bench is 29. So, we can set up the following equation:

\[8 \text{ (test tubes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29\]
\[31 - x = 29\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[x = 31 - 29\]
\[x = 2\]

So, Igor lost 2 beakers.

"First, let's determine how much each person raised:

- Alexandra raises $430.
- Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.
- Sarah raises $300.
- Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add up the amounts raised by all of them:

- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: $750
- Maryam: $700
- Sarah: $300

Total amount raised = $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the distance each ran:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Aaron ran half the distance Vanessa ran, so Aaron ran \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.

2. **Determine the speed of each:**
   - Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, so his speed was \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute} \).
   - Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, so Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute} \).

3. **Calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:**
   - Since Vanessa's speed is \( \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute} \), the time she took to run 4 miles is \( 4 \text{ miles} \div \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ minutes} \).

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race."
"To determine how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line needed for the 200 feet of dock.
2. Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total needed.

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of equations. Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( 2C + 4K = 70 \) (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To eliminate \( C \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 20 - 15 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5.
