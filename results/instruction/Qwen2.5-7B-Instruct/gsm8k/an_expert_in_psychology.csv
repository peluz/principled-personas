"First, let's determine how many eggs Janet has left after using some for breakfast and baking muffins.

1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
2. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
3. She uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends.

So, the total number of eggs used is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Next, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, the total amount she makes from selling the eggs is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, Janet makes \(\boxed{18}\) dollars every day at the farmers' market."

"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repairs) from the new value to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The value increased by 150%, so we need to find 150% of the original purchase price and add it to the original purchase price.

The original purchase price of the house is $80,000. A 150% increase means the value increased by \(1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000\).

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost Josh incurred, which is the purchase price plus the repair cost:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Now, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, Josh's profit is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. He does this 3 times a week. 

First, calculate the total distance he runs in one session:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints/session} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters/session} \]

Next, calculate the total distance he runs in a week:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

So, the total meters James runs in a week is:
\[ 540 \text{ meters} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of feed each chicken consumes in a day. Since each chicken is given 3 cups of feed per meal and there are 3 meals a day, each chicken consumes:

\[ 3 \text{ cups/meal} \times 3 \text{ meals/day} = 9 \text{ cups/day} \]

Given that Wendi has 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement for the entire flock is:

\[ 9 \text{ cups/chicken/day} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 180 \text{ cups/day} \]

Next, we know the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:

- Morning: 15 cups
- Afternoon: 25 cups

The total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:

\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:

\[ 180 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 140 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens \(\boxed{140}\) cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5.

First, calculate the cost of the second glass:
\[ 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how many glasses cost $5 and how many cost $3. Since every second glass is at the reduced price, for 16 glasses, 8 glasses will cost $5 and 8 glasses will cost $3.

Now, calculate the total cost for the glasses that cost $5:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, calculate the total cost for the glasses that cost $3:
\[ 8 \times 3 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, add the two amounts together to find the total cost:
\[ 40 + 24 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay \(\boxed{64}\) dollars for the 16 glasses."

"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he has traveled and then subtract the distance he has covered from his home.

1. **Initial Drive to the Turnaround Point:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John drives for 4 hours in total to get back home.
   - First 2 hours in standstill traffic: 0 miles.
   - Next 30 minutes (0.5 hours) at 30 mph: Distance = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - Remaining time: 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours at 80 mph: Distance = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Traveled on the Return Trip:**
   - Total distance = 0 miles (standstill) + 15 miles (30 mph) + 120 miles (80 mph) = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - John initially drove 180 miles away from home.
   - He then drove 135 miles back towards home.
   - Distance from home = Initial distance - Distance traveled back = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

**Final Answer:**
John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her work hours into regular and overtime hours.

1. **Regular Hours:**
   - Eliza works 40 hours at her regular rate of $10 per hour.
   - Regular earnings = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Hours:**
   - Eliza worked a total of 45 hours, so the overtime hours are 45 - 40 = 5 hours.
   - Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - Overtime earnings = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings
   - Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460.

**Final Answer:**
Eliza's earnings for this week are $460."

Therefore, the total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit becomes positive.

1. **Initial Cost**: The tree costs $90 to plant.
2. **Annual Growth and Revenue**: Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Costs**: The annual cost to water and feed the tree is $3.

The net profit each year is the revenue from selling lemons minus the annual cost:
\[
\text{Net profit per year} = \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5
\]

To find out how many years it will take for the net profit to cover the initial cost of $90, we set up the following equation:
\[
\text{Net profit per year} \times \text{number of years} = \text{Initial cost}
\]
\[
\$7.5 \times \text{number of years} = \$90
\]

Solving for the number of years:
\[
\text{number of years} = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5} = 12
\]

Therefore, it will take **12 years** before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree."
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners at the green house. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. So, she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house. This means she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. According to the problem, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
   To clear the fraction, multiply both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 3:
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners."
"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after the contemporary dance enrollment:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Of these remaining 16 students, 25% enrolled in jazz dance. So, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Now, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students to find out how many are left for hip-hop dance:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the following calculation:

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the value of each purchase after the speculated market increase.

1. **Jewelry Calculation:**
   - Initial value of jewelry: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value after increase: $5,000 + ($5,000 * 2.5%) = $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

2. **Electronic Gadgets Calculation:**
   - Initial value of electronic gadgets: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value after increase: $8,000 + ($8,000 * 1.2%) = $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Now, we compare the final values:
- Jewelry: $5,125
- Electronic gadgets: $8,096

The electronic gadgets will yield a higher value after the market increase. The profit from the electronic gadgets is the final value minus the initial value:
\[ \text{Profit} = \$8,096 - \$8,000 = \$96 \]

Therefore, the profit from choosing the electronic gadgets is:
\[ \boxed{96} \]"

"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance and the total time required for the hike:**
   - Total distance = 12 miles
   - Desired average speed = 4 miles per hour
   - Total time required = Total distance / Desired average speed = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours

2. **Calculate the time already spent:**
   - Time spent on the first 4 miles = 1 hour
   - Time spent on the next 2 miles = 1 hour
   - Total time spent so far = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

3. **Determine the remaining time needed to complete the hike:**
   - Remaining time = Total time required - Time already spent = 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   - Total distance = 12 miles
   - Distance already covered = 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles
   - Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance already covered = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles

5. **Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance:**

**Final numerical answer:**
6 miles per hour"
"First, let's determine the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink before any is spilled. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, we calculate the water content as follows:

\[ \text{Water in orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters} \]

After spilling one liter of the orange drink, the remaining volume of the orange drink is:

\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:

\[ \text{Water in remaining orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, we have:

\[ \text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the water from the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink to find the total amount of water in the 24 liters of mixed drink:

\[ \text{Total water} = 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:

"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total cost of the two pairs of high heels as:
\[ 33 + 2 \times 33 = B - 5 \]

First, calculate the cost of the two pairs of high heels:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Therefore, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and their total age.

Given:
- The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11.
- The sum of their ages is 162.

Let's denote Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The sum of their ages can be expressed as:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we can find the current ages of Darrell and Allen:
- Darrell's age = \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)
- Allen's age = \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"First, let's determine the guesses of each friend:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add these guesses together and divide by the number of guesses (which is 3):

\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]

\[ \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

The average guess is 80."
"To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of his dogs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the daily care time for one dog.
2. Calculate the daily care time for all 10 dogs.
3. Calculate the weekly care time for all 10 dogs.

Step 1: Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business.

Step 2: Since John has 10 dogs, the total daily care time is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Step 3: There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly care time is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of his dogs."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

According to the problem, Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + G = 110 \]

We are also told that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, which gives us another equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

70"
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Raymond has 40 jewels. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Then, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, we subtract 2 from this number to find out how many jewels Siobhan has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points.

25% of 4 points is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{25}{100} = 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Adding the points from both halves of the game:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total points Mike scored is:
\[ 9 \]"
"First, let's determine how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days. Since he eats 2 yogurts a day, over 30 days he will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts. This can be calculated by dividing 60 by 4:

\[ 60 \text{ yogurts} \div 4 \text{ yogurts/set} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, Terry spends \(\boxed{75}\) dollars on yogurt over 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his lego sets. He sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, so:

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 8 video games he buys. Each video game costs $20, so:

\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

John has $5 left after buying the video games. This means the money he spent on the video games plus the $5 left equals the total money he had from selling the lego sets. We can confirm this by adding the cost of the video games and the remaining money:

\[ 160 + 5 = 165 \text{ dollars} \]

Since John had $195 from selling the lego sets, and he spent $165, we can check the calculation:

\[ 195 - 165 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

This $30 is the amount of money he would have if he had sold 2 more lego sets (since each lego set is sold for $15):

\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, John still has 2 lego sets. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   - John runs 3 hours on the first day.
   - Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour.
   - Distance on the first day = \( 3v \) miles.

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   - He runs half as much on the other two days as he does on the first day.
   - Distance on each of the other two days = \( \frac{3v}{2} \) miles.
   - Total distance on the other two days = \( 2 \times \frac{3v}{2} = 3v \) miles.

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   - Total distance = Distance on the first day + Distance on the other two days
   - Total distance = \( 3v + 3v = 6v \) miles.

4. **Total time run in a week:**
   - Time on the first day = 3 hours.
   - Time on each of the other two days = \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.
   - Total time = \( 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \) hours.

5. **Average speed:**
   - Average speed = Total distance / Total time
   - Average speed = \( \frac{6v}{6} = v \) miles per hour.

6. **Determine \( v \):**
   - We know the total distance run in a week is 60 miles.
   - Therefore, \( 6v = 60 \).
   - Solving for \( v \), we get \( v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \) miles per hour.

**Final numerical answer:**
John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour."
"First, let's determine Dana's running and walking speeds based on her skipping speed.

Given:
- Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
- Her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed.

So, her running speed is:
\[ 3 \text{ mph} \times 2 = 6 \text{ mph} \]

Next, we know her running speed is four times her walking speed. Therefore, her walking speed is:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ mph}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \]

Now, we need to calculate the time she spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking in a six-hour period.

Time spent running:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Time spent walking:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the distance she covers while running and walking.

Distance covered while running:
\[ 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Distance covered while walking:
\[ 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances to find the total distance she can travel in six hours:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To determine the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Suzy's iPhone age**: We are given that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
   \[
   \text{Age of Suzy's iPhone} = 1 \text{ year}
   \]

2. **Ben's iPhone age**: Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. Therefore, we calculate Ben's iPhone age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 2 \times \text{Age of Suzy's iPhone} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Brandon's iPhone age**: Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. Therefore, we calculate Brandon's iPhone age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Age of Brandon's iPhone} = 4 \times \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years}
   \]

Thus, the age of Brandon's iPhone is \(\boxed{8}\) years."
"When Polly is not holding the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the gold javelin for a distance of 400 feet. When she holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, the throwing distance with the gemstone is:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the throwing distance with the gemstone:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

200 feet"
"First, we need to determine the total number of pie pieces available initially. Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies, and each pie was cut into 8 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pie pieces is:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the initial total:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total calories in the bag of chips:**
   - Each serving has 250 calories.
   - There are 5 servings in a 300g bag.
   - Total calories in the bag = 250 calories/serving * 5 servings = 1250 calories.

2. **Determine the remaining calories you can consume:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Remaining calories = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

3. **Calculate how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining calories:**
   - The bag contains 1250 calories for 300g.
   - Calories per gram = 1250 calories / 300g = 4.17 calories/g.
   - Grams you can eat = 200 calories / 4.17 calories/g ≈ 48 grams.

Therefore, you can eat approximately 48 grams of chips."
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed to make 20 candles:**
   - Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of supplies:**
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
   - Therefore, for 2 pounds of beeswax, the total cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total revenue is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

"First, let's determine the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

- **Monday**: Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday**: She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Next, we calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
\[ 26 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 104 \text{ hours} \]

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially and after her purchases and usage.
2. Calculate the number of Post-it notes in the package.

First, let's establish the initial number of Post-it notes Candice had:
- Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes.

Next, let's account for the Post-it notes she used at work:
- She used 220 Post-it notes at work.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as \( x \).

After purchasing the package, the total number of Post-it notes she had would be:
\[ 80 + x \]

After using 220 Post-it notes at work, the number of Post-it notes remaining would be:
\[ 80 + x - 220 \]

We know that after all this, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is \( 163 \).

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{163} \]"
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost per blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties and the total cost of the red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{800}

2. **Determine the number of occupied units:**
   - \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the building is occupied.
   - Therefore, the number of occupied units is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \).

3. **Calculate the number of unoccupied units:**
   - The total number of units is 120.
   - The number of occupied units is 90.
   - Therefore, the number of unoccupied units is \( 120 - 90 = 30 \).

**Final Answer:**
The total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"First, let's calculate how many dozens of eggs Lloyd produces per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we calculate how much Lloyd makes per day by selling these dozens of eggs at $2 per dozen:

\[ 21 \text{ dozen} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$42 \]

To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7):

\[ \$42 \times 7 = \$294 \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\$294\) per week from selling eggs."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM and then calculate the time it takes for him to travel back at 6 mph.

1. **Calculate the distance traveled from 1 to 4 PM:**
   - Tom's ship travels at 10 miles per hour.
   - He travels from 1 PM to 4 PM, which is a total of 3 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 10 mph × 3 hours = 30 miles

2. **Calculate the time it takes to travel back:**
   - The distance back is the same, 30 miles.
   - Tom's ship travels back at 6 miles per hour.
   - Time = Distance / Speed
   - Time = 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound, and he removes 30 comic books. Therefore, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more weight needs to be removed to reach the total of 15 pounds. This can be calculated by subtracting the weight of the comic books from the total weight:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys need to be removed to remove the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"

"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to consider both the fixed annual pension and the additional 5% of the value of the pension she becomes entitled to starting after 20 years.

1. **Fixed Annual Pension**: Marcy receives a fixed annual pension of $50,000 per year for the first 20 years.

2. **Additional Pension After 20 Years**: Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to an additional 5% of the value of the pension per year. Since the fixed annual pension is $50,000, 5% of this amount is:
   \[
   0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500
   \]

3. **Total Annual Pension After 20 Years**: After 20 years, Marcy's total annual pension will be the sum of the fixed annual pension and the additional 5% pension:
   \[
   50,000 + 2,500 = 52,500
   \]

Since Marcy quits after 30 years, she will receive the total annual pension of $52,500 for the remaining 10 years.

**Final Answer**:
\[
52,500
\]"
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payments into two halves of the year and apply the given conditions.

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - The monthly charge is $140.
   - Total for the first half: \( 6 \times 140 = 840 \) dollars.

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - There are 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - The monthly charge is 10% less than the initial amount.
   - 10% of $140 is \( 0.10 \times 140 = 14 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the reduced monthly charge is \( 140 - 14 = 126 \) dollars.
   - Total for the second half: \( 6 \times 126 = 756 \) dollars.

3. **Total Amount Paid by the End of the Year:**
   - Sum of the amounts for the first and second halves: \( 840 + 756 = 1596 \) dollars.

The total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is **1596** dollars."
"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate her car's miles per gallon (mpg) based on the information provided.

1. Sophia has traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas.
2. To find the miles per gallon, we divide the miles traveled by the gallons of gas used:
   \[
   \text{mpg} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ mpg}
   \]

3. Now, we know that her car gets 25 miles per gallon. The tank holds 12 gallons of gas.
4. To find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank, we multiply the mpg by the tank capacity:
   \[
   \text{miles on a full tank} = 25 \text{ mpg} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles}
   \]

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"First, let's break down the time Jim spends on TV and reading each time he does this activity.

1. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
2. He then reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is \(2 \div 2 = 1\) hour.

So, each time he does this, he spends a total of \(2 + 1 = 3\) hours on TV and reading.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent each week is:
\[3 \text{ hours/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week}\]

To find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:
\[9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours}\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to consider the number of players and coaches for both the girls' and boys' teams from each school.

1. Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys').
2. Each team has 5 players.
3. Each school also sends 1 coach for each team.

So, for each school:
- Number of players = 5 (girls) + 5 (boys) = 10 players
- Number of coaches = 1 (girls) + 1 (boys) = 2 coaches

Therefore, for each school:
- Total number of people = 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people

Since there are 4 schools:
- Total number of people = 12 people/school * 4 schools = 48 people

"To find the total number of gems in the chest, we need to determine the number of each type of gem and then sum them up.

1. **Diamonds**: The treasure chest contains 175 diamonds.
2. **Rubies**: There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. Therefore, the number of rubies is:
   \[
   175 - 35 = 140
   \]
3. **Emeralds**: There are twice the number of emeralds as the rubies. Therefore, the number of emeralds is:
   \[
   2 \times 140 = 280
   \]

Now, we sum the number of each type of gem to find the total number of gems in the chest:
\[
175 \text{ (diamonds)} + 140 \text{ (rubies)} + 280 \text{ (emeralds)} = 595

"First, let's determine the number of boys at Dr. Wertz's school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

\[ \text{Number of boys} = 2 \times \text{Number of girls} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of students at the school. This is the sum of the number of boys and the number of girls:

\[ \text{Total number of students} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} = 120 + 60 = 180 \]

We know that there are 5 students for every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher:

\[ \text{Number of teachers} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Number of students per teacher}} = \frac{180}{5} = 36 \]

Therefore, the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school is:

Therefore, Tommy raises a total of $221."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones without interest:

\[ 5 \text{ cell phones} \times \$150 \text{ per cell phone} = \$750 \]

Next, we calculate the total interest for the 3-month installment. The interest rate is 2% per unit, and since there are five units, the total interest is:

\[ 5 \times 2\% \times \$150 = 5 \times 0.02 \times 150 = 5 \times 3 = \$15 \]

So, the total amount Shiela will pay is the sum of the original cost and the interest:

\[ \$750 + \$15 = \$765 \]

Since Shiela will pay this amount over 3 months, we divide the total amount by 3 to find the monthly payment:

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can express these as equations:
\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find the number of games they won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ 120 - 80 = 40 \]

So, the number of girls not in the girl scout is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"First, we need to calculate how many hours James slept. Since James slept \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept, and Harry slept 9 hours, we can calculate James's sleep as follows:

\[ \text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James. We do this by subtracting the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the volume loss**: Each can of tomatoes loses half its volume when turned into sauce. Therefore, the 16 ounces of tomatoes in each can result in 8 ounces of sauce.

2. **Calculate the number of cans used**: Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces. Since each can produces 8 ounces of sauce, we can find the number of cans used by dividing the total volume of sauce by the volume of sauce per can:
   \[
   \text{Number of cans} = \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of tomatoes per can**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes.

4. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes**: Since Freda used 4 cans and each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:
   \[
   \text{Total number of tomatoes} = 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total cars originally on the motorway**: 30 cars.
2. **Cars that took an exit**: 5 cars.
3. **Cars that remained in the traffic jam**: \(30 - 5 = 25\) cars.
4. **Cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes**: 20 cars.

Since the total number of cars that remained in the traffic jam is 25, and 20 of them drove through in the last 15 minutes, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes} = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

**Final numerical answer:**

"First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary already has:

Mary has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, the total number of potted plants she already has is:
\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, we need to determine how many potted plants she will give away:

Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. So, the total number of potted plants she will give away is:
\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Now, we can calculate the number of potted plants Mary will remain with after giving some away:

The number of potted plants she will have left is the total she already has minus the number she will give away:
\[ 80 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Finally, we add the 18 new potted plants she received:
\[ 40 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To determine the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and then sum these values.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. This means the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we sum the number of doorbell rings from all four friends:
\[20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175\]

Thus, the total number of doorbell rings is \(\boxed{175}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:

- Science textbook: 4 pages
- Social Studies textbook: 20 pages
- History textbook: 7 pages
- Geography textbook: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages per day

So, Solo needs to read an average of 6 pages per day for the next 4 days.

6 pages per day"
"John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner every weekday, which is 5 days a week. Additionally, he drinks a glass of water before bed every weekday. So, for the weekdays, he drinks:

- 3 glasses of water per meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner) = 3 glasses/meal × 3 meals = 9 glasses
- 1 glass of water before bed = 1 glass

Total for weekdays = 9 glasses + 1 glass = 10 glasses

On weekends, he drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but not before bed. So, for the weekends, he drinks:

- 3 glasses of water per meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner) = 3 glasses/meal × 3 meals = 9 glasses

Total for weekends = 9 glasses

Therefore, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is:

10 glasses (weekdays) + 9 glasses (weekends) = 19 glasses

19 glasses"
"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the information given about the rate at which the fog bank covers the city.

The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. We need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles.

First, we calculate the time it takes to cover 1 mile:
\[ \text{Time per mile} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes to cover 42 miles:
\[ \text{Total time} = 42 \text{ miles} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"First, we need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each dimension to get the inner dimensions (subtracting 1 inch from each side of the length, width, and height).

The inner dimensions of one box are:
- Length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
- Width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

Next, we calculate the inner volume of one box using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is length × width × height.

The inner volume of one box is:
\[3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches}\]

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume of all 3 boxes.

The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[24 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic inches}\]

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is \(\boxed{72}\)."

   - Total for Thursday: \(1 \text{ hour} + 0.5 \text{ hour} = 1.5 \text{ hours}\).

3. **Friday:**
   - Frankie watched two 1-hour episodes.
   - Total for Friday: \(2 \times 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}\).

4. **Total hours watched from Monday to Friday:**
   - Sum of hours from Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday: \(2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 5.5 \text{ hours}\).

5. **Total hours of TV watched in the week:**
   - Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV in the week.

6. **Hours watched on Wednesday:**
   - Let \(x\) be the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday.
   - Total hours for Wednesday: \(x \times 0.5 \text{ hours}\).

7. **Setting up the equation:**
   - Total hours from Monday to Friday plus Wednesday equals 7 hours.
   - \(5.5 \text{ hours} + 0.5x = 7 \text{ hours}\).

8. **Solving for \(x\):**
   \[
   0.5x = 7 \text{ hours} - 5.5 \text{ hours}
   \]
   \[
   0.5x = 1.5 \text{ hours}
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{1.5 \text{ hours}}{0.5 \text{ hours/episode}}

Therefore, Frankie watched \(\boxed{3}\) 30-minute episodes on Wednesday."
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies. However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Next, isolate \( 2x \) by subtracting 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\)."

   - Each board originally cost $10.
   - Sasha has 10 boards.
   - Total cost for 2x4x10 boards = \( 10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100 \).

2. **Cost of 4x4x10 boards:**
   - Each board originally cost $16.
   - Sasha has 5 boards.
   - Total cost for 4x4x10 boards = \( 5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80 \).

3. **Total original cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of 2x4x10 boards + Cost of 4x4x10 boards
   - Total cost = \$100 + \$80 = \$180.

Next, let's calculate the total selling price of the lumber.

1. **Selling price of 2x4x10 boards:**
   - Since prices have increased by 50%, the new price per board is \( \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15 \).
   - Sasha has 10 boards.
   - Total selling price for 2x4x10 boards = \( 10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150 \).

2. **Selling price of 4x4x10 boards:**
   - Since prices have increased by 50%, the new price per board is \( \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24 \).
   - Sasha has 5 boards.
   - Total selling price for 4x4x10 boards = \( 5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120 \).

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of \(\boxed{90}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, given the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13 and the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons.

First, let's denote the amount of sugar as \( S \) and the amount of water as \( W \). According to the problem, the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, which can be written as:
\[ \frac{S}{W} = \frac{7}{13} \]

This ratio tells us that for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. Therefore, the total parts of the mixture (sugar + water) is:
\[ 7 + 13 = 20 \]

We know the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons. This total can be represented as:
\[ S + W = 120 \]

Since the ratio of sugar to the total mixture is 7 out of 20, we can express the amount of sugar \( S \) as:
\[ S = \frac{7}{20} \times 120 \]

Now, we perform the multiplication:
\[ S = \frac{7 \times 120}{20} = \frac{840}{20} = 42 \]

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is:
\[ \boxed{42} \]"

"On the first day, the customs officer counted 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles on the first day is:

\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day:

\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles/container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4."
"First, let's determine Lylah's initial salary. Adrien's total salary four years ago was $40,000, which was 30% higher than Lylah's salary. Let's denote Lylah's initial salary as \( L \).

Given that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can write the equation:
\[ 40000 = L + 0.3L \]
\[ 40000 = 1.3L \]
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.3} \]
\[ L = 30769.23 \]

So, Lylah's initial salary was approximately $30,769.23.

Next, we need to calculate Adrien's salary four years later. Adrien's salary increased by 40% from his initial salary of $40,000. Therefore, his new salary is:
\[ 40000 + 0.4 \times 40000 = 40000 \times 1.4 = 56000 \]

Now, we need to determine Lylah's salary four years later. Since both salaries increased simultaneously by the same percentage, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. Therefore, her new salary is:
\[ 30769.23 + 0.4 \times 30769.23 = 30769.23 \times 1.4 = 43076.92 \]

Finally, we add Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries to find the total salary they were receiving four years later:
\[ 56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92 \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:
\[ \boxed{99076.92} \]"

Therefore, Rosie can run a total of 50 miles in 7 hours."
"Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps. To find out how many letters she stamped, we calculate one-third of 60:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]

So, Jennie stamped 20 letters. These 20 letters are now added to the pile of already-stamped letters. We know that after adding these 20 letters, there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. Therefore, the number of letters that were already in the pile of already-stamped letters before Jennie added the 20 new ones is:

\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \]

So, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began was 10.

1. Determine how many friends Amy has.
2. Add the number of friends Amy has to the number of friends Lily has.

First, we know that Lily made 50 friends. According to the problem, Amy made 20 more friends than Lily. Therefore, we can calculate the number of friends Amy has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of friends Amy has} = \text{Number of friends Lily has} + 20 = 50 + 20 = 70 \]

Next, we add the number of friends Amy has to the number of friends Lily has to find the total number of friends they have together:

\[ \text{Total number of friends} = \text{Number of friends Amy has} + \text{Number of friends Lily has} = 70 + 50 = 120 \]

Therefore, the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of each item based on the given information:

1. Each pepper costs $15.
2. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, so:
   \[
   \text{Cost of a watermelon} = 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so:
   \[
   \text{Cost of an orange} = 45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the items Dillon is buying:

1. The cost for 4 watermelons:
   \[
   4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ dollars}
   \]
2. The cost for 20 peppers:
   \[
   20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The cost for 10 oranges:
   \[
   10 \times 40 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Finally, we add up all these costs to find the total amount of money Dillon will spend:
\[
180 + 300 + 400 = 880 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is:
\[
\boxed{880}

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of elves who quit after children vomit on them.
2. Subtract the number of elves who quit from the initial number to find the remaining number of elves.
3. Subtract the number of elves who quit after kids kick their shins from the remaining number.

Let's start with the first step:

1. A third of the 60 elves quit after children vomit on them:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]
   So, 20 elves quit.

2. Subtract the 20 elves who quit from the initial 60 elves:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
   So, 40 elves remain.

3. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins:
   \[
   40 - 10 = 30
   \]

"To find Joseph's total expenditure for May and June, we first need to determine his expenditure for June. Given that his expenditure in May was $500 and in June it was $60 less, we can calculate June's expenditure as follows:

\[ \text{Expenditure in June} = \text{Expenditure in May} - 60 = 500 - 60 = 440 \]

Next, we add the expenditures of both months to find the total expenditure:

\[ \text{Total Expenditure} = \text{Expenditure in May} + \text{Expenditure in June} = 500 + 440 = 940 \]

Therefore, Joseph's total expenditure for May and June is $940."
"First, let's calculate the total number of rides each person took:

- Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she took a total of \(2 + 2 = 4\) rides.
- Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he took a total of \(4 + 2 = 6\) rides.

Next, we calculate the total number of rides for both Pam and Fred combined:

- Total rides = Pam's rides + Fred's rides = \(4 + 6 = 10\) rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is:

- Total tickets = Total rides \(\times\) Tickets per ride = \(10 \times 6 = 60\) tickets.

Therefore, they used 60 tickets that day."
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many miles Walt walked on Tuesday.
2. Calculate the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday.
3. Subtract the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday through Wednesday to find the miles walked on Wednesday.

First, we know that on Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday. Therefore, the miles walked on Tuesday are:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday:
\[ 4 + 24 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

We know that the total miles walked from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. Therefore, the miles walked on Wednesday can be found by subtracting the total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday through Wednesday:
\[ 41 - 28 = 13 \text{ miles} \]

"First, let's calculate the cost of the items before any additional fees or tips:

- Cost of 2 subs at $7.50 each: \(2 \times 7.50 = 15.00\)
- Cost of 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each: \(2 \times 1.50 = 3.00\)
- Cost of 2 cookies at $1.00 each: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)

Adding these together gives the total cost of the items:
\[15.00 + 3.00 + 2.00 = 20.00\]

Next, we need to calculate the 20% delivery fee:
\[20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00\]

Adding the delivery fee to the total cost of the items:
\[20.00 + 4.00 = 24.00\]

"To determine how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the number of questions he was able to complete in each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions in each test.

First, let's calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the first test:
- The test had 75 questions.
- Mark's rate is 5 questions per hour.
- He had 8 hours to complete the test.

The number of questions he completed in the first test is:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ questions} \]

Since the test had 75 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete in the first test is:
\[ 75 - 40 = 35 \text{ questions} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the second test:
- The test had 100 questions.
- Mark's rate is 5 questions per hour.
- He had 6 hours to complete the test.

The number of questions he completed in the second test is:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ questions} \]

Since the test had 100 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete in the second test is:
\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \text{ questions} \]

Finally, to find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete, we add the incomplete questions from both tests:
\[ 35 + 70 = 105 \]

Therefore, the total number of questions Mark left incomplete is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as \( B \) and the number of pink gumballs as \( P \).

According to the problem, the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs. This can be written as:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

We are given that there are 12 blue gumballs, so \( B = 12 \).

Substituting \( B = 12 \) into the equation:
\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

Therefore, there are 70 pink gumballs.

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many cars are semi-automatic. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. 

The number of semi-automatic cars can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total number of cars} - (\text{Number of automatic cars} + \text{Number of manual cars}) \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - (12 + 4) = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

Therefore, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic."
"Let's define the variables for the different types of bees:
- Let \( Q \) be the number of queen bees.
- Let \( B \) be the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) be the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \).

We also know the total number of bees in the hive is 700:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

First, substitute \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q \]
\[ B = 2Q \]

Now substitute these into the total number of bees equation:
\[ 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is:
\[ \boxed{400} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many hours Jordan spends playing video games in a week. Since he plays for 2 hours every day, and there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total hours spent playing video games as follows:

\[ 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{hours/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jordan would earn if he spent those 14 hours working instead of playing video games. Since he earns $10 per hour at his part-time job, we can calculate his earnings as follows:

\[ 14 \, \text{hours/week} \times 10 \, \text{\$/hour} = 140 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Therefore, if Jordan spent his video game time working instead, he would earn \(\boxed{140}\) dollars in one week."
"First, let's identify which items are non-food items. In this case, the light bulbs, cups, and roach traps are non-food items. The milk and eggs are food items.

The cost of the non-food items is:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost of non-food items before tax: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Now, we calculate the 10% tax on the non-food items:
10% of $10 = 0.10 * $10 = $1

So, the total cost of the non-food items after tax is:
$10 + $1 = $11

Next, we add the cost of the food items:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3

Total cost of food items: $2 + $3 = $5

Finally, we add the cost of the food items and the non-food items after tax to get the total cost:
$5 (food items) + $11 (non-food items after tax) = $16

Therefore, the total cost of everything is:
$16"
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have. He already has 3 clients and is talking to 5 potential clients, so:

\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ clients} \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of bottles of bleach and packs of cloths required. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths, so for 8 clients:

\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times 2 \text{ bottles of bleach per client} = 16 \text{ bottles of bleach} \]
\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times 1 \text{ pack of cloths per client} = 8 \text{ packs of cloths} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the bleach and cloths. Each bottle of bleach costs $2 and each pack of cloths costs $5, so:

\[ 16 \text{ bottles of bleach} \times \$2 \text{ per bottle} = \$32 \]
\[ 8 \text{ packs of cloths} \times \$5 \text{ per pack} = \$40 \]

Adding these together gives the total expenses:

\[ \$32 + \$40 = \$72 \]

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:

\[ \$92 - \$72 = \$20 \]

Therefore, the profit Kim will make each week is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"

"Johnny has three Lego sets to pick up. The first set has 500 pieces. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, which means it has \(500 \times 3 = 1500\) pieces. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, which means it has \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

To find the total number of pieces Johnny picks up, we add the pieces from all three sets together:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

So, Johnny picks up a total of 2125 pieces."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Bees leaving: 30 bees

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - Bees returning: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) bees

3. **Following 6 hours:**
   - Bees leaving: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Bees returning: All the bees that left in the first 60 bees have now returned.

To find the number of bees that returned in the last 6 hours, we need to account for the bees that left in the first 60 bees and did not return in the previous 6 hours.

- Bees that left in the first 6 hours: 30 bees
- Bees that returned in the next 6 hours: 15 bees
- Bees that left in the following 6 hours: 60 bees

So, the number of bees that left in the first 60 bees and did not return in the previous 6 hours is:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ bees} \]

These 15 bees plus the 60 bees that left in the following 6 hours will return in the last 6 hours:
\[ 15 + 60 = 75 \text{ bees} \]

Therefore, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is:

"First, let's determine how many Facebook friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

Given that Charlie has 12 friends, we can substitute and solve for Dorothy's friends:

\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now, we know Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends. Next, we need to find out how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

Substituting the number of Dorothy's friends:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends.

"To determine how long the winner will wait for the loser, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to reach home:
- Steve's time: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Tim's time: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

Since Steve is the winner, we need to find out how long he will wait for Tim:
- Time difference: \(40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\)

Therefore, the winner (Steve) will wait for the loser (Tim) for 4 minutes.

The final answer is:
4 minutes"
"First, let's calculate the number of tires inflated for each type of vehicle:

- For bicycles, each has 2 tires. Since 5 people came by to get both tires inflated, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- For tricycles, each has 3 tires. Since 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- For unicycles, each has 1 tire. Since 1 person came by to get their unicycle tire inflated, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Next, we add up all the tires inflated:
\[10 \text{ (bicycle tires)} + 9 \text{ (tricycle tires)} + 1 \text{ (unicycle tire)} = 20 \text{ tires}\]

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total amount of money made is:
\[20 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 500 \text{ cents}\]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total amount to dollars:
\[500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 5 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Shawnda made that day is:
\[5 \text{ dollars}\]"

"Let's work through the problem step by step to find out how many french fries were in the pack initially.

1. Let the initial number of french fries be \( x \).

2. Dave ate 14 fries, so the remaining fries are \( x - 14 \).

3. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries. So, the remaining fries are \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \).

4. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so the pigeons ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries. The remaining fries are \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).

5. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, so the remaining fries are \( \frac{1}{3} \) of \( x - 30 \), which is \( \frac{x - 30}{3} \).

6. Ants carried off the final french fry, leaving 5 behind. So, the remaining fries before the ants took the last one were 6. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   \frac{x - 30}{3} = 6
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x - 30 = 18 \implies x = 48
   \]

So, the initial number of french fries in the pack was \(\boxed{48}\)."
"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes on a typical week:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has three 1-hour classes each day. So, for these three days, he spends:
  \[
  3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ hour/day} = 3 \text{ hours}
  \]
- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, for these two days, he spends:
  \[
  2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 4 \text{ hours}
  \]

Adding these together gives the total number of hours he spends in classes in one week:
\[
3 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 7 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many hours he spends in classes over the entire semester. Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, we multiply the weekly total by 16:
\[
7 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 112 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[

"First, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good in inches:

1. **Rolls**: Bill bakes 300 rolls, and each roll is 4 inches long.
   \[
   300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Chocolate Croissants**: Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants, and each croissant is 6 inches long.
   \[
   120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Baguettes**: Bill bakes 60 baguettes, and each baguette is 2 feet long. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, each baguette is 24 inches long.
   \[
   60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches}
   \]

Next, we sum the total length of all the baked goods in inches:
\[
1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches}
\]

Finally, we convert the total length from inches to feet. Since 1 foot = 12 inches:
\[
3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 280 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, if Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they will be 280 feet long."

   - For 2 months: \(200 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 400 \text{ bananas}\).

2. **Gorillas' Requirement:**
   - Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(400 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 800 \text{ bananas}\).

3. **Baboons' Requirement:**
   - Baboons need 100 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(100 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 200 \text{ bananas}\).

Next, we sum the total number of bananas required for all the apes over the 2-month period:

\[
400 \text{ bananas (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ bananas (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ bananas (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas}
\]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Since the football field is 100 yards long, running back and forth once covers a distance of \(100 \times 2 = 200\) yards. Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so the total distance Blake runs is:
\[ 200 \times 15 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is a distance of \(40 \times 2 = 80\) yards. She does this 34 times, so the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[ 80 \times 34 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we need to determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards. The difference in the distances they run is:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, the winner runs \(\boxed{280}\) yards farther than the loser."
"To find out how much Raphael spent on everything, we need to calculate the total cost of the pens, notebooks, and bond paper he bought.

1. **Cost of Pens:**
   - Number of pens: 4
   - Cost per pen: $1.5
   - Total cost for pens: \( 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \) dollars

2. **Cost of Notebooks:**
   - Number of notebooks: 2
   - Cost per notebook: $4
   - Total cost for notebooks: \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) dollars

3. **Cost of Bond Paper:**
   - Cost of bond paper: $20

Now, we add up all these costs to find the total amount Raphael spent:

\[
6 \text{ (pens)} + 8 \text{ (notebooks)} + 20 \text{ (bond paper)} = 34 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Raphael spent a total of $34 on everything."
"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 tadpoles come out from under a lily pad, which doesn't change the total number of tadpoles he sees because they were already part of the 11. After that, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so those 2 are no longer visible to Finn. 

To find out how many tadpoles Finn can see now, we subtract the 2 hidden tadpoles from the initial count:

11 - 2 = 9

Finn can now see 9 tadpoles in the pond."
"To determine the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the water depth on Tuesday:**
   - The water depth on Monday is 17 feet.
   - On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday.
   - Therefore, the water depth on Tuesday is:
     \[
     17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Determine the water depth on Wednesday:**
   - On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday.
   - Therefore, the water depth on Wednesday is:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet} = \frac{2 \times 24}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{48}{3} \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet}
     \]

The tank’s water depth on Wednesday is \(\boxed{16}\) feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin:

- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3

Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Next, let's calculate the number of fish caught by Locsin:

- Starfish: 5 fewer than Anakin = 10 - 5 = 5
- Sea horses: 3 fewer than Anakin = 6 - 3 = 3
- Clownfish: 2 more than Anakin = 3 + 2 = 5

Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Now, let's add the total fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:

Total fish caught by Anakin and Locsin = 19 + 13 = 32

Therefore, the total number of fish they were able to catch is 32."
"To determine the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase step by step, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

1. **Initial Price**: $20
2. **Increase every 2 months**: 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4

Since the price increases every two months, we need to determine how many 2-month periods are in 36 months:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/period}} = 18 \text{ periods} \]

Each period, the price increases by $4. Therefore, the total increase over 36 months is:
\[ 18 \text{ periods} \times \$4/\text{period} = \$72 \]

Adding this total increase to the initial price:
\[ \$20 + \$72 = \$92 \]

Thus, the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months is:
\[ \boxed{92} \]"

   - Total cost = $20 + $15 + $15 = $50

**Final Answer:**
The total value of all the toys is $50."
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant, we need to calculate the financial impact of both options.

1. **Cost of hiring an accountant:**
   - The accountant charges $90.

2. **Missed income from doing taxes herself:**
   - Jackie will lose 3 hours of freelance work.
   - She earns $35 per hour from freelance work.
   - Therefore, the missed income is \(3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105\).

3. **Net financial impact:**
   - If Jackie hires the accountant, she will spend $90.
   - If she does her taxes herself, she will lose $105 in potential income.
   - The difference in financial impact is \( \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \).

Therefore, Jackie will have \$15 more if she hires the accountant."
"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she has chosen and subtract this from her budget.

First, let's list the costs of the items:
- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Next, we add these costs together:
\[ 1090 + 157 + 74 + 157 + 74 + 102 \]

Let's break it down step by step:
\[ 1090 + 157 = 1247 \]
\[ 1247 + 74 = 1321 \]
\[ 1321 + 157 = 1478 \]
\[ 1478 + 74 = 1552 \]
\[ 1552 + 102 = 1654 \]

The total cost of the items is €1654. However, Elvira's budget is only €1500. Since the total cost exceeds her budget, she will not have any money left for clothing. In fact, she will be short by:
\[ 1654 - 1500 = 154 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she will need for 15 Spanish flans.

Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs. Therefore, for 15 flans, Sandra will need:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Sandra's neighbor gives her a basket of 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times."
"Let's define the current ages of Seth and Brooke using variables. Let \( B \) represent Brooke's current age, and \( S \) represent Seth's current age. According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the first equation as:

\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The problem states that the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can write the second equation as:

\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying the second equation, we get:

\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now we substitute the expression for \( S \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age is 8, we can find Seth's current age using the first equation:

\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old. 

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"

"Pancho walks 20 miles each day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, the total miles he walks from Monday to Friday is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles each day. So, the total miles he walks on the weekend is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the miles walked during the weekdays and the weekend gives:
\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week is:

"To determine the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each component and then sum them up.

1. **Hat Cost:**
   The hat costs $25.

2. **Jacket Cost:**
   The jacket costs three times as much as the hat.
   \[
   \text{Jacket Cost} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Pants Cost:**
   The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket.
   \[
   \text{Pants Cost} = \frac{\text{Hat Cost} + \text{Jacket Cost}}{2} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}

"First, let's calculate the total minimum monthly payment Jessica needs to make on all her debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. So, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum monthly payment and add it to the total minimum monthly payment:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

Therefore, the total monthly payment Jessica will make is:

$1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:

$1500 * 12 = $18000

So, Jessica pays $18000 in a year."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel one potato. It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato. Since there are 60 potatoes, the total time to peel all the potatoes is:

\[ 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut one potato. It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut one potato. For 60 potatoes, the total time to cut all the potatoes is:

\[ 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 300 \text{ seconds} \]

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert 300 seconds to minutes:

\[ 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to peel the potatoes and the time it takes to cut the potatoes:

\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."

"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent and car fuel.

1. **Rent**: Zaid spends \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car fuel**: Zaid spends \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we calculate the remaining amount after these expenses.
\[
\text{Remaining after rent and car fuel} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
\]

3. **Donation to charity**: Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation to charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we calculate the remaining amount after the donation.
\[
\text{Remaining after donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
\]

4. **Giving money to daughter and wife**: Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars.
   \[
   \text{Total given to daughter and wife} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the current ages:**
   - Jan's current age is 30 years.
   - Jean is two years older than Mark, so if Mark's current age is \( M \), then Jean's current age is \( M + 2 \).

2. **Formulate the relationship from the past:**
   - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
   - Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \).
   - According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. So, we can write the equation:
     \[
     M - 2 = \frac{28}{2} + 5
     \]
   - Simplify the right side of the equation:
     \[
     M - 2 = 14 + 5
     \]
     \[
     M - 2 = 19

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the Probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The difference in probability is:
\[ 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.25 \times 100 = 25\% \]

### Final Answer
Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts and use the information given to find the number of rats in each cage.

1. **Hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = \(10 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ pieces per hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces}\).

2. **Rabbits:**
   - 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.
   - This is a fixed amount and does not affect the number of rats.

3. **Total straw used:**
   - The total straw distributed among the small rodents (rats and hamsters) is 160 pieces.
   - Straw used for hamsters = 50 pieces.
   - Straw used for rats = \(160 \text{ pieces} - 50 \text{ pieces} = 110 \text{ pieces}\).

4. **Rats:**
   - The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups.
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for rats = 110 pieces.
   - Number of rats = \(\frac{110 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per rat}} = \frac{110}{6} = 18.33\).

Since the number of rats must be a whole number, and we know the rats are distributed equally among 3 cages, we need to find a whole number of rats that, when divided by 3, gives a whole number of rats per cage. The closest whole number that fits is 18 rats (since 18 is divisible by 3).

5. **Rats per cage:**
   - Number of rats per cage = \(\frac{18 \text{ rats}}{3 \text{ cages}} = 6 \text{ rats per cage}\).

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the compounded interest over these months.

1. **Initial Amount**: $100
2. **Monthly Interest Rate**: 2% or 0.02

The formula for the amount after each month with compound interest is:
\[ A = P (1 + r)^n \]
where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n months, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate.
- \( n \) is the number of months the money is invested or borrowed for.

For 3 months, the calculation is:
\[ A = 100 \times (1 + 0.02)^3 \]

First, calculate \( (1 + 0.02)^3 \):
\[ (1 + 0.02)^3 = 1.02^3 \approx 1.061208 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial amount:
\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the amount Mandy should give to Benedict is:
\[ \boxed{106.12} \]"
"To determine the number of bags the trader sold, we need to calculate the total cost per bag, the total revenue, and then use the profit to find the number of bags.

1. **Calculate the total cost per bag:**
   - Cost of wheat per bag: $20
   - Transportation cost per bag: $2
   - Total cost per bag: $20 + $2 = $22

2. **Determine the selling price per bag:**
   - Selling price per bag: $30

3. **Calculate the profit per bag:**
   - Profit per bag: Selling price - Total cost per bag = $30 - $22 = $8

4. **Use the total profit to find the number of bags:**
   - Total profit: $400
   - Number of bags = Total profit / Profit per bag = $400 / $8 = 50

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The tickets cost $20.25 in total. The food cost $4.50 less than the tickets, so the food cost is:

\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the rides. Since each ride costs $33 and they went on 2 rides, the total cost for the rides is:

\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:

\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"To determine how many peaches John collects, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of minutes John spends collecting peaches.
2. Determine how many peaches he collects per minute.
3. Multiply the total number of minutes by the number of peaches collected per minute.

First, we know that John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total number of minutes as follows:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that John collects 2 peaches per minute. Therefore, the total number of peaches collected is:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ peaches/minute} = 360 \text{ peaches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{360} \]"
"To determine how many pounds of insects a flock of ten ducks needs per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weekly requirement for the flock.
2. Convert the weekly requirement into a daily requirement.

First, we know that each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. For a flock of ten ducks, the total weekly requirement is:
\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of insects the flock needs per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the weekly requirement by 7:
\[ \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks needs \(\boxed{5}\) pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year, so the net increase is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees per year.
3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the net increase in trees is \(8 \times 10 = 80\) trees. Adding this to the initial number of trees, we get \(50 + 80 = 130\) trees.
4. **Trees that die**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, the number of trees that die is \(0.30 \times 130 = 39\) trees.
5. **Final number of trees**: Subtracting the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years, we get \(130 - 39 = 91\) trees.

So, the final number of trees Tom has left is \(\boxed{91}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Placement on Friday:**
   - Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Modification on Saturday:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - So, 6 pink flamingos were taken back.
   - The remaining pink flamingos are \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - These 6 pink flamingos were then painted white and put back out.
   - Now, Sue's front yard has 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

3. **Additional Placement on Sunday:**
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos.
   - The total number of pink flamingos is now \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
   - The number of white flamingos remains 6.

4. **Final Count:**
   - Pink flamingos: 30
   - White flamingos: 6

5. **Difference Calculation:**
   - The difference between the number of pink and white flamingos is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

At noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

"First, let's determine the cost of one pen. According to the problem, a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. Given that a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, we can calculate the cost of one pen as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \text{Cost of a pencil} + \text{Cost of an eraser} \]
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \$1.20 + \$0.30 \]
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \$1.50 \]

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \text{Cost of one pen} \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \$1.50 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = \$12.00 \]

Therefore, the cost of 8 pens is \$12.00."

"First, let's break down the information given:

- Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week.
- He edits an equal number of sentences for each of the two publishers.
- Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence.
- Publisher B pays him twice as much as Publisher A per sentence.

Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B each week.

Now, let's calculate the payment from each publisher:

- Payment from Publisher A: \(500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents}\)
- Payment from Publisher B: \(500 \text{ sentences} \times (2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence}) = 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents}\)

Adding the payments from both publishers gives us the total amount Mark makes in a week:

\[2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents}\]

Therefore, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week."

"First, let's determine the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can calculate the weight of each candied apple as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40 \text{g}}{2} = 20 \text{g} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars. There are 25 chocolate bars, each weighing 40g:

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{g} = 1000 \text{g} \]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples. There are 80 candied apples, each weighing 20g:

\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{g} = 1600 \text{g} \]

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000 \text{g} + 1600 \text{g} = 2600 \text{g} \]

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is \(\boxed{76}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates would be 6 plates.
   - Therefore, the cost of half a dozen plates is \(6 \times 6000 = 36000\) dollars.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - The cost of half a dozen plates is $36000.
   - Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is \(36000 - 1200 = 34800\) dollars.

3. **Determine the cost of one dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups cost $34800.
   - Therefore, the cost of one dozen cups is \(\frac{34800}{20} = 1740\) dollars.

4. **Determine the cost of one cup:**
   - One dozen cups is 12 cups.
   - Therefore, the cost of one cup is \(\frac{1740}{12} = 145\) dollars.

The total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{145}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- Sara babysits 4 times, earning $5 each time, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.

Now, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from mowing the lawn:
- Let \(x\) be the number of times Sara mows the lawn.
- Her parents pay her $4 each time, so she earns \(4x\) dollars from mowing the lawn.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the total amount of money Sara has before mowing the lawn is \(10 + 20 = 30\) dollars. To find out how much more money she needs to afford the items, we subtract the amount she already has from the total cost:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

This $40 is the amount she needs to earn from mowing the lawn. Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we can find the number of times she needs to mow the lawn by dividing $40 by $4:
\[ x = \frac{40}{4} = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( r \) be the number of red chickens.
- Let \( w \) be the number of white chickens.

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( w = r + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"

- Width = 1.5 miles

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time Gary spends walking. The formula for time \( t \) is:

\[ t = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \]

Given:
- Distance = 15 miles
- Speed = 3 miles/hour

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we need to subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total.

So, the number of customers on the third day is \(500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\).

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons, and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool now has \( S = 8 \) gallons of water.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Her part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find the number of hours, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase.

44"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She is paying $165 per month for 12 months, so the total payment is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of dahlias in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, and there are 4 roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, to find the total number of flowers in the vase, we add the number of roses and the number of dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

Therefore, there are 15 flowers in the vase in total."
"First, let's determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's current age is given as 21 years old.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's current age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years old.
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years old.

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\) years old.
- Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\) years old.
- Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\) years old.

Now, we find the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

The average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To determine how many points Jojo scored, we need to first calculate the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna, and then subtract their total from the overall total points scored by the four students.

1. **Naomi's Points:**
   Naomi scored 68 points.

2. **Yuri's Points:**
   Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. First, we calculate half of Naomi's points:
   \[
   \frac{68}{2} = 34
   \]
   Then, we add 10 to this value:
   \[
   34 + 10 = 44
   \]
   So, Yuri scored 44 points.

3. **Brianna's Points:**
   Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. Therefore:
   \[
   68 + 17 = 85
   \]
   So, Brianna scored 85 points.

4. **Total Points of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:**
   Adding up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
   \[
   68 + 44 + 85 = 197
   \]

5. **Jojo's Points:**
   The total points scored by all four students is 251. Therefore, Jojo's points can be found by subtracting the total points of the other three students from 251:
   \[
   251 - 197 = 54
   \]

Thus, Jojo scored \(\boxed{54}\) points."
"To determine the total time Carmen spent solving puzzles, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- Carmen takes 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on crossword puzzles is \(10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}\).

Next, let's calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- Carmen takes 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on sudoku puzzles is \(5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes}\).

Now, we add the time spent on both types of puzzles:
- Total time spent on crossword puzzles: 30 minutes
- Total time spent on sudoku puzzles: 40 minutes
- Therefore, the total time spent on both types of puzzles is \(30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}\).

"1. Start with the initial amount of water in the tank: 120 liters.
2. Subtract the amount of water Celine used: \(120 - 90 = 30\) liters.
3. Celine then collects rainwater, which is twice the amount left in the tank: \(2 \times 30 = 60\) liters.
4. Add the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank: \(30 + 60 = 90\) liters.

Therefore, the final amount of water in the tank is 90 liters."
"First, let's determine the number of petunias Andy plants. Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, we subtract 40 from the number of geraniums:

90 (geraniums) - 40 = 50 (petunias)

Next, we add the number of geraniums and petunias to find the total number of flowers:

90 (geraniums) + 50 (petunias) = 140

Therefore, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers."
"The company spends $15000 on advertising for the first year. For the second year, it spends a third of $15000 on advertising, which is:

\[ \frac{15000}{3} = 5000 \]

\[ 15000 + 5000 = 20000 \]

Therefore, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"To find the total cost of the rentals for Carlos and Benji, we need to calculate the cost for each separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for Carlos:
- Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour.
- He uses the canoe for 3 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Carlos is \( 30 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \).

Next, let's calculate the cost for Benji:
- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour.
- He uses the raft for 5 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Benji is \( 18 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \).

Now, we add the costs together to find the total amount they will pay:
- Total cost = Cost for Carlos + Cost for Benji
- Total cost = \( 90 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 180 \text{ dollars} \).

Therefore, the total amount Carlos and Benji will pay for their rentals, altogether, is \( 180 \text{ dollars} \)."

"First, let's determine the total number of cards James has after the changes:

- Initially, James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards.
- After losing 8 water type cards, he has \(40 - 8 = 32\) water type cards.
- After buying 14 grass type cards, he has \(20 + 14 = 34\) grass type cards.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards:
\[ 30 \text{ (fire type)} + 34 \text{ (grass type)} + 32 \text{ (water type)} = 96 \text{ cards} \]

Next, we need to find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type card. The probability is given by the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, then multiplied by 100 to convert it to a percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Now, calculate the percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 33.33 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is:
\[ 33 \]

So, the final answer is:

"To calculate how much Chad still owes, let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Base burrito**: $6.50
2. **Extra meat**: $2.00
3. **Extra cheese**: $1.00
4. **Avocado**: $1.00
5. **2 sauces**: $0.25 each, so $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
6. **Upgrade for chips and a drink**: $3.00

First, we add up all the additional costs:
\[ 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 + 3.00 = 7.50 \]

Now, we add the base burrito cost to the total additional costs:
\[ 6.50 + 7.50 = 14.00 \]

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract this from the total:
\[ 14.00 - 5.00 = 9.00 \]

Therefore, Chad still owes:

"First, let's determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces.

Kalinda's rate is 4 pieces per minute.

Her mom's rate is half of Kalinda's rate, so:
\[ \text{Mom's rate} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Next, we calculate their combined rate:
\[ \text{Combined rate} = \text{Kalinda's rate} + \text{Mom's rate} = 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the 360-piece puzzle:
\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{\text{Total pieces}}{\text{Combined rate}} = \frac{360}{6} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration:

\[ 12 \text{ cars} \times \$20,000 \text{ per car} = \$240,000 \]

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%, so:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$240,000 = 0.10 \times \$240,000 = \$24,000 \]

Now, we add the tax to the cost of the cars:

\[ \$240,000 + \$24,000 = \$264,000 \]

Then, we calculate the registration cost. The registration fee is $1000 per car, so for 12 cars:

\[ 12 \text{ cars} \times \$1000 \text{ per car} = \$12,000 \]

Finally, we add the registration cost to the total cost including tax:

\[ \$264,000 + \$12,000 = \$276,000 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for everything is:

\[ \$276,000 \]"

1. We know that there were 50 ants in the garden.
2. The problem states that Dax found half as many bugs as ants. Therefore, the number of bugs is half the number of ants.

Let's calculate the number of bugs:
\[ \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of ants} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

Now, we add the number of ants and bugs to find the total number of insects in the garden:
\[ \text{Total number of insects} = \text{Number of ants} + \text{Number of bugs} = 50 + 25 = 75 \]

Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens.
2. **First Cycle of Refilling**: After using these 25 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. This process can be repeated as long as he has enough empty pens.

Let's calculate the number of new pens he can make from the 25 pens he initially bought:

- From 25 pens, he can make \( \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) new pens.
- After making these 5 new pens, he now has 5 empty pens from the new pens and 20 empty pens from the original 25 pens, totaling 25 empty pens.
- From these 25 empty pens, he can make \( \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) more new pens.
- After making these 5 new pens, he now has 5 empty pens from the new pens and 20 empty pens from the previous 25 pens, totaling 25 empty pens again.
- This process can be repeated until he no longer has enough empty pens to make a new pen.

Since each cycle of making new pens from 5 empty pens results in 5 new pens, and he starts with 25 pens, he can repeat this process 5 times (since \( 25 \div 5 = 5 \)).

So, the total number of pens he ends up with is the initial 25 pens plus the 5 new pens he makes each time for 5 cycles:

\[ 25 + 5 \times 5 = 25 + 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"

4. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C, which is the remaining students after those who went out through exits A and B.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.**

30% of 1000 students went out through exit A:
\[ 0.30 \times 1000 = 300 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A.**

\[ 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B.**

3/5 of the remaining 700 students went out through exit B:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C.**

The rest of the students went out through exit C:
\[ 700 - 420 = 280 \]

"First, let's determine how many cookies Sue and her sister ate on each day.

**Monday:**
- Sue's sister ate 5 cookies.
- Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

**Tuesday:**
- Sue's sister ate 13 cookies.
- Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

**Total cookies:**
- Sue's sister ate \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies.
- Sue ate \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.

Now, we calculate the total calories consumed by each of them. Since each cookie has 200 calories:

**Calories consumed:**
- Sue's sister consumed \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.
- Sue consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister:

\[9200 - 3600 = 5600\]

So, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of animals killed last night:**
   - Wolves: 10
   - Cougars: 15

2. **Determine the number of animals killed today:**
   - Let \( C \) be the number of cougars killed today.
   - According to the problem, Rick killed three fewer cougars today than he did last night. Therefore, \( C = 15 - 3 = 12 \).
   - Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today. Therefore, the number of wolves killed today is \( 3 \times C = 3 \times 12 = 36 \).

3. **Calculate the total number of animals killed today:**
   - Wolves: 36
   - Cougars: 12
   - Total animals killed today: \( 36 + 12 = 48 \)

4. **Calculate the total number of animals killed over the two days:**
   - Wolves killed last night: 10
   - Cougars killed last night: 15
   - Total animals killed last night: \( 10 + 15 = 25 \)

"First, let's determine how many times Anne went down the water slide. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. Mitchel went down the slide 30 times.

To find 30% of Mitchel's times:
\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, which means:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Anne went down the slide 21 times.

Next, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. Since Anne went down the slide 21 times, Robert went down the slide:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times."
"First, let's determine the initial number of cows in the ten stalls. Since each of the ten stalls has 20 cows, the total number of cows is:

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the twenty stalls. To find out how many new cows go into each stall, we divide the 40 new cows by the 20 stalls:

\[ 40 \text{ cows} \div 20 \text{ stalls} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in each stall after the new cows are added. Initially, each stall has 20 cows, and now each stall gets 2 more cows:

\[ 20 \text{ cows} + 2 \text{ cows} = 22 \text{ cows/stall} \]

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:

\[ 22 \text{ cows/stall} \times 8 \text{ stalls} = 176 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:

\[ \boxed{176} \]"

1. **Pennies:**
   - Brady has 100 pennies.
   - Each penny is worth $0.01.
   - Total value of pennies: \( 100 \times 0.01 = 1.00 \) dollars.

2. **Nickels:**
   - Brady has 40 nickels.
   - Each nickel is worth $0.05.
   - Total value of nickels: \( 40 \times 0.05 = 2.00 \) dollars.

3. **Dimes:**
   - Brady has 20 dimes.
   - Each dime is worth $0.10.
   - Total value of dimes: \( 20 \times 0.10 = 2.00 \) dollars.

"First, let's calculate the total number of 10-foot sections in the 200-foot tall redwood:

\[
\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections}
\]

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any of it is:

\[
20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Termites ate 30% of the redwood, so 70% of the redwood remains. To find the remaining weight, we calculate 70% of 8000 pounds:

\[
0.70 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the weight of the redwood after the termites have eaten is:

\[
5600 \text{ pounds}

"Given that Andrea has 52 apples, we can start by determining how many apples Jamal has. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Andrea's apples} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]

Substituting the number of apples Andrea has:

\[ 52 = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]

Solving for Jamal's apples:

\[ \text{Jamal's apples} = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

Next, we need to find out how many bananas Jamal has. According to the problem, Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples:

\[ \text{Jamal's bananas} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal:

\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{\text{Jamal's bananas}}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits. First, we sum up the fruits for each person:

- Andrea's total fruits: 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76
- Jamal's total fruits: 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92

Adding these together gives the total number of fruits:

\[ 76 + 92 = 168 \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits is:

\[ \boxed{168} \]"

     \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate two thirds of the total number of pennies.
2. Convert the number of pennies to dollars.

First, we calculate two thirds of 9,300 pennies:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200 \text{ pennies}
\]

Next, we convert 6,200 pennies to dollars. Since 100 pennies equal 1 dollar:
\[
6200 \text{ pennies} \div 100 = 62 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is:

"First, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

1. **Brokerage Fee Calculation:**
   - Brokerage fee = 5% of $350,000
   - Brokerage fee = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500

2. **Transfer Fee Calculation:**
   - Transfer fee = 12% of $350,000
   - Transfer fee = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

3. **Total Price Calculation:**
   - Total price = Selling price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
   - Total price = $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500

4. **Comparison with Budget:**
   - Mrs. Cruz's budget = $400,000
   - Difference = Total price - Mrs. Cruz's budget

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Time to heat the oil to 300 degrees:** 20 minutes.
2. **Time to heat the oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees:** It takes 40% longer than the initial 20 minutes. 
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat from 300 to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.
3. **Time to cook the chicken:** 5 minutes less than the time it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - The time to cook the chicken is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

Now, we add up all the times:
- Time to heat to 300 degrees: 20 minutes
- Time to heat from 300 to 400 degrees: 28 minutes
- Time to cook the chicken: 23 minutes

Total time = \(20 + 28 + 23 = 71\) minutes.

"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each part of his performance and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   - Therefore, the first scene has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, Sean's lines in the first scene are \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\).

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
   - Therefore, the second scene has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, Sean's lines in the second scene are \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\).

"First, let's calculate how many cards had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

So, 32 cards had the letter A on them. This leaves us with:

\[ 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 48 cards had the letter B. Since 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

So, 24 cards had the letter B on them. This leaves us with:

\[ 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Now, we need to find out how many of the remaining 24 cards had the letter C. Since 5/8 of the rest had the letter C, we calculate:

\[ \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

So, 15 cards had the letter C on them. This leaves us with:

\[ 24 - 15 = 9 \]

Therefore, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is:

"First, let's calculate the total time Matthew spends digging the small holes. Since it takes him 3 minutes to dig one small hole, for 30 small holes, the total time is:

\[ 30 \text{ holes} \times 3 \text{ minutes/hole} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the large holes. Since it takes him 10 minutes to dig one large hole, for 15 large holes, the total time is:

\[ 15 \text{ holes} \times 10 \text{ minutes/hole} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on both types of holes to get the total time in minutes:

\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes."
"The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 20 + 20 = 40.

Final numerical answer:
40"
"Let's define the current ages of Ruby and Sam with variables. Let \( R \) be Ruby's current age and \( S \) be Sam's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Expanding the right side of the equation:

\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting \( 3S \) from both sides:

\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Then, we subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 3S = 18 \]

Finally, we divide both sides by 3:

"To find out how much Peter paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the popsicles:
- Peter purchased 20 popsicles.
- Each popsicle costs $0.25.
- Therefore, the total cost for the popsicles is \( 20 \times 0.25 = 5 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars:
- Peter purchased 4 ice cream bars.
- Each ice cream bar costs $0.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the ice cream bars is \( 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:
- Total cost = Cost of popsicles + Cost of ice cream bars
- Total cost = \( 5 + 2 = 7 \) dollars.

Therefore, Peter paid a total of 7 dollars."
"First, let's determine the number of spots on a mamba. According to the problem, a cobra has 70 spots and has twice as many spots as a mamba. Therefore, a mamba has:

\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \text{ spots} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \text{ spots} \]

Then, we calculate the total number of spots for all the mambas. There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \text{ spots} \]

Now, we find the combined total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \text{ spots} \]

Finally, we need to find half of this combined total number of spots:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2450 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people at the soccer game:

- There are 12 team members.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so that's \(12 \times 2 = 24\) guests.
- There are also 3 coaches.

Adding these together, the total number of people is:
\[ 12 \text{ (team members)} + 24 \text{ (guests)} + 3 \text{ (coaches)} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3:
\[ \frac{39}{3} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pizza costs $15, so:
\[ 13 \text{ pizzas} \times 15 \text{ dollars per pizza} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Maddy will spend:
\[ \boxed{195} \]"
"To determine how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones:**
   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
   - Total length of topaz gemstones = \( 8 \times 1 = 8 \) inches.

2. **Determine the remaining length for the sterling silver beads:**
   - The total length of each necklace is 25 inches.
   - Length occupied by topaz gemstones = 8 inches.
   - Remaining length for sterling silver beads = \( 25 - 8 = 17 \) inches.

3. **Calculate the number of sterling silver beads needed:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long.
   - Number of sterling silver beads = \( \frac{17}{0.25} \).

4. **Perform the division:**
   - \( \frac{17}{0.25} = 17 \div 0.25 = 17 \times 4 = 68 \).

Therefore, Katerina uses \(\boxed{68}\) sterling silver beads per necklace."
"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. 

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we add the stories from both weeks:
- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Adding these together gives:
\[60 + 120 + 180 = 360\]

Therefore, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is 360."

\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \]

So, in 3 years, Ann's brother will be 21 years old."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents.

Kelly has 5 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the total value of the quarters is:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly also has 2 dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, the total value of the dimes is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the value of the quarters and dimes together gives:
\[ 125 + 20 = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how many cents she has left, we subtract the cost of the pop from her total amount of money:

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 90 \text{ cents} \]"
"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the 76-star flag, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of stars in the three rows of 8 stars and the two rows of 6 stars.
2. Subtract this number from the total number of stars (76) to find out how many stars are in the 5-star rows.
3. Divide the number of stars in the 5-star rows by 5 to find the number of 5-star rows.

Let's start with step 1:
- Three rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars
- Two rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars

Adding these together gives:
\[24 + 12 = 36\] stars

Now, subtract this from the total number of stars (76) to find the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
\[76 - 36 = 40\] stars

So, the number of rows of 5 stars is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, we first need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight for 80 flagstones is:

\[ 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to carry this total weight, given that each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds. We do this by dividing the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks} \]

Therefore, the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip is:

"First, let's determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed. Therefore, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles. The formula to calculate time is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's determine how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, Izzy has:

\[ 22 - 5 = 17 \text{ medals} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ 22 + 17 = 39 \text{ medals} \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

\[ \boxed{390} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars per packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get in total:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars per adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Subtract the chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we need to distribute these 16 chocolate bars equally among the 8 children:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars per child} \]

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"First, let's determine the total time Susan works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she takes a half-hour break, so the actual working time is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we convert the working time from hours to minutes because Susan's earnings are calculated in 10-minute intervals. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 2.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we calculate how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

\[ \frac{150 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 15 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Susan earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, her total earnings are:

\[ 15 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/interval} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Susan earns \(\boxed{75}\) dollars for the online task."
"First, let's determine the points each player has after the first three rounds:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we need to check if each player has over 20 points to see if they get an extra point in the fourth round:

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point, keeping his total at 18 points.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Now, we sum up the points of all three players after the extra points have been distributed:

- Mike: 22 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 43 points

Total points = \(22 + 18 + 43 = 83\).

The final numerical answer is:
83"
"First, let's determine the ages of the sons:
- The oldest son is 8 years old.
- The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so the youngest son is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) years old.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each son washes:
- The oldest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, which is 8 oranges.
- The youngest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, which is 4 oranges.

Now, we add the number of oranges washed by both sons:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Will originally bought 15 oranges. To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges:
\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of oranges left unwashed is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Let's break down the activities Darren did on each day and then sum them up.

**First Day:**
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

**Second Day:**
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's calculate the total for each type of activity over the two days:

**Total Pushups:**
100 (first day) + 120 (second day) = 220

**Total Squats:**
50 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 90

**Total Dumbbell presses:**
20 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 60

Finally, we sum up all the activities:
220 (pushups) + 90 (squats) + 60 (dumbbell presses) = 370

**Total count of activities he's done in the two days:**
370"
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for the household, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the daily rice consumption for the household:**
   - Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
   - Each person eats rice at lunch and dinner, so each person consumes \(0.2 \, \text{kg} \times 2 = 0.4 \, \text{kg}\) of rice per day.
   - There are 5 members in the household, so the total daily consumption is \(0.4 \, \text{kg} \times 5 = 2 \, \text{kg}\).

2. **Calculate the weekly rice consumption for the household:**
   - There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly consumption is \(2 \, \text{kg} \times 7 = 14 \, \text{kg}\).

3. **Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last:**
   - Divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption: \(42 \, \text{kg} \div 14 \, \text{kg/week} = 3 \, \text{weeks}\).

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

1. Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, so he only had 5 days to sell bread.
2. Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates.
3. On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
4. On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
5. On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

Now, let's sum up the crates sold:

- Weekend sales: 20 crates
- Tuesday sales: 15 crates
- Wednesday sales: 12 crates
- Thursday sales: 18 crates

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the total crates sold from the target:

120 - 65 = 55 crates

So, Sam was off by 55 crates from his target for the week."
"To determine the total cost of the antique desk for Carmen, we need to calculate the sequence of bids and sum them up.

1. **Initial Bid**: Carmen accepts the opening bid of $200.
2. **First Other Bidder**: The bid rises by $50, so the first other bidder bids $200 + $50 = $250.
3. **Carmen's First Bid**: Carmen bids $250 + $50 = $300.
4. **Second Other Bidder**: The bid rises by another $50, so the second other bidder bids $300 + $50 = $350.
5. **Carmen's Second Bid**: Carmen bids $350 + $50 = $400.
6. **Third Other Bidder**: The bid rises by another $50, so the third other bidder bids $400 + $50 = $450.
7. **Carmen's Final Bid**: Carmen bids $450 + $50 = $500 and wins the auction.

Now, we sum up all the bids Carmen made:
- First bid: $300
- Second bid: $400
- Final bid: $500

Total cost = $300 + $400 + $500 = $1200

The desk costs Carmen $1200."
"To calculate the total annual cost for John's driving service, we need to break down the costs into several components and then sum them up.

1. **Daily Miles Driven:**
   - John's work is 30 miles away, so he drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, totaling 60 miles per day.

2. **Weekly Miles Driven:**
   - John drives 60 miles per day and works 5 days a week, so he drives \(60 \times 5 = 300\) miles per week.

3. **Annual Miles Driven:**
   - John drives 300 miles per week and works 50 weeks a year, so he drives \(300 \times 50 = 15000\) miles per year.

4. **Cost per Mile:**
   - John is charged $2 per mile. Therefore, the cost for the miles driven in a year is \(15000 \times 2 = 30000\) dollars.

5. **Monthly Bonus:**
   - John gives a $150 bonus per month. There are 50 weeks in a year, which is approximately 12 months (since \(50 \div 4 \approx 12.5\), we can consider 12 months for simplicity in this context). Therefore, the total bonus for the year is \(150 \times 12 = 1800\) dollars.

6. **Total Annual Cost:**
   - Adding the cost for the miles driven and the total bonus, the total annual cost is \(30000 + 1800 = 31800\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount John pays a year for driving is **$31,800**."
"To determine how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

Adding these together:
\[ 23 + 16 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined. Therefore, we need to multiply the total time from Monday and Sunday by 2:
\[ 39 \times 2 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Peter has to exercise for \(\boxed{78}\) minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the structure of the folding process. Each piece of paper, when folded in half, will produce two pages. Therefore, for a 32-page tabloid, we need to calculate how many pieces of paper are required to produce 32 pages.

Since each piece of paper produces 2 pages when folded in half, we can set up the following relationship:

\[ \text{Number of pages} = 2 \times \text{Number of pieces of paper} \]

Given that the tabloid has 32 pages, we can solve for the number of pieces of paper:

\[ 32 = 2 \times \text{Number of pieces of paper} \]

Dividing both sides by 2:

\[ \text{Number of pieces of paper} = \frac{32}{2} = 16 \]

Therefore, 16 pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid.

16"

"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of books sold in the first year:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of books sold in the current year (the third year).
   - According to the problem, \( x = 45 \).
   - The number of books sold in the first year is twice the number sold in the current year, so it is \( 2x = 2 \times 45 = 90 \).

2. **Calculate the number of books sold in the second year:**
   - The total number of books in the collection is 250.
   - The number of unsold books is 50.
   - Therefore, the total number of books sold over the three years is \( 250 - 50 = 200 \).
   - The number of books sold in the second year is the total sold minus the books sold in the first and third years: \( 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 \).

3. **Calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year:**
   - Each book sells for $20.
   - The number of books sold in the second year is 65.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money earned in the second year is \( 65 \times 20 = 1300 \).

The total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is \(\boxed{1300}\)."
"First, let's calculate Watson's weekly earnings from his hourly wage:

- Watson works 10 hours each day.
- He works 5 days a week.
- He earns $10 per hour.

So, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
\[ 10 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$500 \]

Since the company performed well for the whole month of April, Watson also receives a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total weekly earnings are:
\[ \$500 + \$300 = \$800 \]

Next, we need to determine how many weeks are in April. April typically has 4 weeks.

So, Watson's total earnings for April are:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times \$800/\text{week} = \$3200 \]

Therefore, Watson made \(\$3200\) in April."
"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. 

First, calculate how many people he beat:
\[ 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \]

Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total and beat 16 of them, the number of people he lost to is:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, John lost to 4 people."
"First, let's determine how many loaves are sold in the morning. Two-thirds of the 60 loaves are sold in the morning:

\[

"First, let's determine how much weight Joey loses per week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the weekly weight loss for Joey is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight as Joey does in a single week, which is 2 pounds. However, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Therefore, to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds (the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks), we can use the following calculation:

Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, and Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds, we can set up the proportion based on the rate of weight loss:

\[ \text{Sandy's weight loss rate} = \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week} \]

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Total weight to lose}}{\text{Sandy's weekly weight loss rate}} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 16 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

1. **Extra Arms:**
   - The serum causes an extra arm every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra arms grown is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The serum causes an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra legs grown is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

Adding the extra arms and legs together:
- Total new limbs = Extra arms + Extra legs = 5 + 3 = 8.

Therefore, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. The cost of one business suit is $100, so:
\[ 5 \times \$100 = \$500 \]
\[ \text{Flight ticket cost} = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

The total amount Theo has initially is $6000, and he wishes to save $2000. Therefore, the amount he can spend on other items is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

Now, let's sum up the costs of the suits, suitcases, and flight ticket:
\[ \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$2050 \]

The remaining amount for buying gifts is:
\[ \$4000 - \$2050 = \$1950 \]

Therefore, Theo has to spend \(\boxed{1950}\) on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"First, let's break down the daily egg consumption:

- Three people eat 3 eggs each per day, so that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
- The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each per day, so that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.

Adding these together, the total daily egg consumption for the family is \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs.

Since they eat eggs every day, over the course of a week (7 days), the family will consume \(13 \times 7 = 91\) eggs.

Therefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the current population of Chile based on the given information.

1. **Determine Cera's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera.
   - Therefore, Noah was \(\frac{40}{2} = 20\) years old six years ago.

3. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Noah was 20 years old six years ago.
   - Therefore, Noah is now \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

4. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Noah was 20 years old six years ago.
   - Therefore, the population six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

5. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now.
   - Therefore, the current population is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

**Final Answer:**
The population of Chile now is 120000."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) people.

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Finally, to find out how many people showed up, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:

\[24 - 10 = 14\]

So, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.
2. He added these 20 marbles to a store that already had 50 marbles.
3. His father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since he bought 20 marbles, his father gave him \(\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8\) marbles.
4. Now, we need to find the total number of marbles Solomon has. This is the sum of the marbles he bought, the marbles he already had in the store, and the marbles his father gave him. So, the total number of marbles is \(20 + 50 + 8 = 78\).
5. Each marble weighs 2kgs. Therefore, the total weight of the marbles is \(78 \times 2 = 156\) kgs.

The total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is \(\boxed{156}\) kgs."
"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \times 5 \, \text{ft} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

"Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

1. Let the number of electric poles be \( P \) and the number of electric wires be \( W \).
2. According to the ratio, \( P:W = 1:3 \).
3. This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.
4. Given \( W = 45 \), we can set up the proportion: \( \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \).
5. Substituting \( W = 45 \) into the proportion, we get \( \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \).
6. Solving for \( P \), we multiply both sides by 45: \( P = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \).

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15."

   - It is given that 22 men stayed at the party.

5. **Men Who Left:**
   - Number of men who left: 25 - 22 = 3

6. **Women Who Stayed:**
   - Since 10 people in total left and 3 of them were men, the rest must be women.
   - Number of women who left: 10 - 3 = 7
   - Number of women who stayed: 15 - 7 = 8

Therefore, the number of women left at the party is 8."
"First, let's determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as a book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs:

\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{4}{2} = \$2 \]

Next, we need to find out how much the pen costs. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so:

\[ \text{Cost of pen} = 2 - 1 = \$1 \]

Therefore, the pen costs $1."
"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. According to the problem, Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together give a total of 26 pencils. We can confirm this by noting that the 2 loose pencils plus the pencils in the three boxes equal 26 pencils.

Next, we need to find out how many pencils are in the three boxes. Since the total number of pencils is 26 and 2 of those are loose, the number of pencils in the three boxes is:
\[ 26 - 2 = 24 \]

Now, we know that Jam has 26 pencils and Meg has 46 pencils. To find out the total number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together, we add the number of pencils each has:
\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

To store all 72 pencils, we need to determine how many boxes are required. Since each box can hold the same number of pencils as the three boxes Jam has (which is 24 pencils per box), we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:
\[ 72 \div 24 = 3 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 3 boxes to store all their pencils. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the additional liquid (cream) added.

1. **Cooling Effect of Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - Shannon's coffee is cooled by 65 degrees.
   - To find out how many ice cubes are used, we divide the total cooling by the cooling per ice cube:
     \[
     \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Effect of Ice Cubes on Coffee Strength:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - With 5 ice cubes, the total weakening effect is:
     \[
     \text{Total weakening from ice cubes} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

3. **Effect of Added Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream.
   - The cream also weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     \text{Total weakening} = 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
     \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio and apply it to the given scenario.

1. The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record.
2. 5 people leave with 7 new records.

Since each new record is obtained by trading 2 old records, the total number of old records traded for 7 new records is:
\[ 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

Therefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior programmers. Given that the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, and the total number of employees is 100, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

\[
\text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers can be calculated as:

\[
\text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total monthly payment to all junior programmers is:

\[
\text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
\]

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:

\[
2000 + 400 = 2400 \text{ per month}
\]

Thus, the total monthly payment to all senior programmers is:

\[
\text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
\]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:

\[
\text{Total payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000

"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the percentage of charge needed to fully charge the phone.
2. Determine the time required to charge that percentage based on the given rate.

Step 1: Calculate the percentage of charge needed.
The phone is currently at 60% charge, so it needs an additional 40% to be fully charged.

Step 2: Determine the time required to charge 40%.
The phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. Therefore, to find out how long it takes to charge 40 percentage points, we multiply 40 by 3 minutes.

\[ 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Step 3: Convert the time from minutes to hours.
There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 120 minutes by 60 to convert it to hours.

\[ \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the cell phone."

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 43 - 4 - 8 = 31 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A:

1. **Annual Salary**: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
2. **Tax**: 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
3. **Net Pay**: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B:

1. **Annual Salary**: $42,000
2. **Property Tax**: $6,000
3. **Net Income After Property Tax**: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two larger groups as \( x \). Therefore, the smallest group will have \( x - 10 \) students.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of students in the three groups:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, add 10 to both sides:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Then, divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two larger groups has 70 students. The smallest group, which has 10 fewer students than each of the larger groups, will have:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

1. Let \( C \) represent the number of cows.
2. Let \( H \) represent the number of chickens.

From the problem, we know:
- Farmer Brown has a total of 60 animals: \( C + H = 60 \).
- He has twice as many chickens as cows: \( H = 2C \).

First, substitute \( H = 2C \) into the first equation:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now, substitute \( C = 20 \) back into the equation \( H = 2C \):
\[ H = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

So, Farmer Brown has 20 cows and 40 chickens.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each:
- Total legs from cows: \( 20 \times 4 = 80 \)
- Total legs from chickens: \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \)

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:
\[ 80 + 80 = 160 \]

Therefore, the total number of legs the animals have is:

- Juice Box C costs $7 more than Juice Box A, so it costs $4 + $7 = $11.

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:

$11 (Juice Box C) - $9 (Juice Box B) = $2.

So, Juice Box C is $2 more than Juice Box B."
"To calculate the total number of legs from the tables in the restaurant, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs from the 40 tables with 4 legs each.
2. Calculate the total number of legs from the 50 tables with 3 legs each.
3. Add the two totals together to get the overall number of legs.

Step 1: \(40 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ legs per table} = 160 \text{ legs}\)

Step 2: \(50 \text{ tables} \times 3 \text{ legs per table} = 150 \text{ legs}\)

Step 3: \(160 \text{ legs} + 150 \text{ legs} = 310 \text{ legs}\)

The total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Jenny's son takes for his lunch each week. Since he takes 4 cookies 5 days a week, we calculate:

\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cookies Jenny's husband eats in a week. Since he eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, we have:

\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 7 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Now, we add the cookies taken by her son and her husband to find out how many cookies are taken out of the total 36 cookies each week:

\[ 20 \text{ cookies} + 7 \text{ cookies} = 27 \text{ cookies} \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of cookies taken by her son and her husband from the total number of cookies in the bag to find out how many cookies Jenny eats:

\[ 36 \text{ cookies} - 27 \text{ cookies} = 9 \text{ cookies} \]

So, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount. Each shirt costs $30, so for 2 shirts, the cost would be:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount is 40%, so we calculate 40% of $60:

\[ 0.40 \times 60 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the discount from the original total cost to find out how much Davos paid:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Davos paid \(\boxed{36}\) dollars for the 2 shirts."
"First, let's calculate the daily revenue from tractors:

- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.

So, the daily revenue from tractors was:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily revenue from silos:

- They now sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.

So, the daily revenue from silos is:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find the percentage increase in daily revenue from tractors to silos. The formula for percentage increase is:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value}}{\text{Old Value}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100 - \$1000}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 0.1 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 10\% \]

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now."
"To calculate the total amount of money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to break down the costs for each item and then sum them up for a year.

1. **Food Cost:**
   - Food costs $25 per week.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost for food is \( 25 \times 4 = 100 \) dollars.
   - For a year (12 months), the cost for food is \( 100 \times 12 = 1200 \) dollars.

2. **Treats Cost:**
   - Treats cost $20 per month.
   - For a year (12 months), the cost for treats is \( 20 \times 12 = 240 \) dollars.

3. **Medicine Cost:**
   - Medicine costs $100 per month.
   - For a year (12 months), the cost for medicine is \( 100 \times 12 = 1200 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up all the costs for a year:
\[ 1200 \text{ (food)} + 240 \text{ (treats)} + 1200 \text{ (medicine)} = 2640 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Madeline spends \(\boxed{2640}\) dollars on her dog per year."
"To determine the total number of hours Peyton's after-work activities will take, we need to calculate the duration of each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Yoga Class (Monday)**: The yoga class lasts for 1 hour.
2. **Cooking Class (Tuesday)**: The cooking class lasts three times as long as the yoga class. Therefore, the cooking class lasts \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
3. **Cheese-Tasting Event (Wednesday)**: The cheese-tasting event lasts for 0.5 hours (30 minutes).
4. **Museum Tour (Thursday)**: The museum tour takes half as long as the cooking class. Therefore, the museum tour lasts \(\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\) hours.
5. **Errands (Friday)**: The errands take 2 hours.

\[ 1 \text{ (yoga)} + 3 \text{ (cooking)} + 0.5 \text{ (cheese-tasting)} + 1.5 \text{ (museum tour)} + 2 \text{ (errands)} \]

Adding these together:
\[ 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 8 \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Peyton's after-work activities will take is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of plant pots needed for the roses. Since the school asked for twice as many plant pots for the roses as for the daisies, and they asked for 30 plant pots for the daisies, we calculate the number of plant pots for the roses as follows:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we add the number of plant pots needed for the daisies and the roses to find the total number of plant pots required:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \]

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number of plant pots she bought:

4. The result will be the amount she saved.

Let's do the calculations step by step:

1. Andrea initially had $36.
2. She spent $11 on a sweater. So, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   36 - 11 = 25
   \]
3. She then gave her brother $4. So, the remaining amount after giving her brother money is:
   \[
   25 - 4 = 21
   \]

Therefore, the amount Andrea saved is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming. He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Next, he watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is:

\[ 3 \times 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on vacation. Then:

\[ 0.30T = 15 \text{ hours} \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ hours}}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:

\[ 0.40 \times 50 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time John spent sightseeing is:

"First, let's calculate how much money Annabelle earns from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so:

\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much money she earns from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so:

\[ 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, let's add the money she already has in her savings to the money she earns from both jobs:

\[ 80 \, \text{dollars} + 200 \, \text{dollars} + 75 \, \text{dollars} = 355 \, \text{dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so the amount of money Annabelle still needs to save is:

\[ 400 \, \text{dollars} - 355 \, \text{dollars} = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save \(\boxed{45}\) dollars."
"To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the height of the second tree.
2. Calculate the combined height of the shortest and second trees.
3. Find the height of the tallest tree, which is twice the combined height of the shortest and second trees.

Step 1: The height of the second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree. Since the shortest tree is 6 feet tall, the second tree is:
\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet} \]

Step 2: The combined height of the shortest and second trees is:
\[ 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet} \]

Step 3: The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and second trees:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"

1. **Cost of mini-golf for one person:**
   - One round of mini-golf costs $5.

2. **Cost of go-karts for one person:**
   - One ride on the go-karts costs $10.
   - Morgan wants to ride the go-karts twice, so the cost is \(10 \times 2 = 20\) dollars.

3. **Total cost for one person (including mini-golf and go-karts):**
   - Mini-golf: $5
   - Go-karts: $20
   - Total: \(5 + 20 = 25\) dollars.

4. **Total cost for Morgan and her friends:**
   - Let \(n\) be the number of friends.
   - The total cost for Morgan and her friends is \(25(n + 1)\) dollars (including Morgan herself).

5. **Cost for arcade tokens:**
   - Each person gets $5 in arcade tokens.
   - Total cost for arcade tokens for \(n + 1\) people is \(5(n + 1)\) dollars.

6. **Total cost for Morgan and her friends (including mini-golf, go-karts, and arcade tokens):**
   - Total cost: \(25(n + 1) + 5(n + 1) = 30(n + 1)\) dollars.

7. **Morgan's budget:**
   - Morgan has $90 budgeted for the party.

8. **Set up the equation and solve for \(n\):**
   \[
   30(n + 1) \leq 90

"First, let's calculate how much money Marisa spends on lollipops each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops every day. Therefore, the total cost of lollipops per day is:

\[ 4 \text{ lollipops/day} \times 25 \text{ cents/lollipop} = 100 \text{ cents/day} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, Marisa spends $1 each day on lollipops.

Next, we need to determine how much money Marisa has left after buying the lollipops each day. She gets $5 as pocket money every day, so the amount she saves each day is:

\[ \$5 - \$1 = \$4 \]

Now, we need to find out how much she saves over 5 days. Since she saves $4 each day, over 5 days she will save:

\[ \$4 \text{ per day} \times 5 \text{ days} = \$20 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of steps to determine how many pounds of candy Billy bought.

1. **Calculate the total amount spent on gumballs:**
   - Billy bought 40 gumballs.
   - Each gumball costs $0.05.
   - Total cost for gumballs = \( 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the amount of money Billy had before buying gumballs:**
   - Billy spent half of his change on gumballs.
   - Therefore, the total change before buying gumballs is \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the amount of money Billy had after buying candy:**
   - Billy started with $10.
   - He spent $4 on gumballs.
   - Therefore, the amount of money he had after buying candy is \( 10 - 4 = 6 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the amount of money spent on candy:**
   - The amount of money spent on candy is the initial $10 minus the $6 he had after buying candy.
   - Therefore, the amount spent on candy is \( 10 - 6 = 4 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the number of pounds of candy Billy bought:**
   - The cost of candy is $1.5 per pound.
   - Therefore, the number of pounds of candy bought is \( \frac{4}{1.5} = \frac{4 \times 2}{1.5 \times 2} = \frac{8}{3} \approx 2.67 \) pounds.

Thus, Billy bought approximately \( \frac{8}{3} \) pounds of candy. 

**Final numerical answer:**
\[
\boxed{\frac{8}{3}}

"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \).

According to the problem, Carver is 45 years old, which is 5 years less than twice his son's age. We can express this relationship with the following equation:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles.
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles.
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: \(75 + 100 - 50 = 125\) miles.

So, the total distance for one trip is:
\[ 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance traveled is:
\[ 300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles/day} \]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it takes to reach 18,000 miles, we divide 18,000 by the daily distance:
\[ \frac{18000}{900} = 20 \]

Therefore, the train goes between services every 20 days.

"First, let's determine the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed. The problem states that a bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed.

The amount of stuffing for a Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds, and for a chihuahua bed, it is 2 pounds. The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

For 4 chihuahua beds:
\[
4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

For 3 collie beds:
\[
3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}

"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass, we need to ensure that the total points from all three tests sum to at least 42 points.

First, we add the points from the first two tests:
\[ 15 \text{ points (first test)} + 18 \text{ points (second test)} = 33 \text{ points} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more points are required to reach at least 42 points:
\[ 42 \text{ points (total required)} - 33 \text{ points (current total)} = 9 \text{ points} \]

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on her third test to pass.

The minimum number of points she must score on the third test to pass is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of people kicked out for shoplifting. According to the problem, this number is four times the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks minus 5. Since 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, we can calculate the number of shoplifters as follows:

\[ 4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

Next, we need to find the number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. The problem states that this number is three times the number of shoplifters. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we know the total number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence over goods on sale. Adding these together, we get:

\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

The total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is 50. To find the number of people kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the number of people kicked out for the three specific reasons from the total:

\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:

\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"First, let's determine how many points Erin has now. According to the problem, after scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times more points than Sara. Sara has scored 8 points.

If Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can calculate Erin's current points as follows:
\[ \text{Erin's current points} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Since Erin's current points are 24 and she scored 14 points to reach this total, we can find out how many points she had before by subtracting the 14 points she scored from her current total:
\[ \text{Erin's points before} = \text{Erin's current points} - 14 = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

Therefore, Erin had 10 points before."

So, 20 pupils like blue. This leaves us with:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 20 pupils like green. One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so we calculate:

\[ \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

So, 5 pupils like green. The rest of the pupils like yellow. To find out how many pupils like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils:

\[ 40 - 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of apples sold on Monday:**
   - Lucy sold the apples for $4 each.
   - She earned $56 from selling the apples on Monday.
   - Number of apples sold on Monday = Total earnings / Price per apple
   \[
   \text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{56}{4} = 14
   \]

2. **Determine the number of apples picked on Tuesday:**
   - Lucy picked 12 apples on Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Number of apples picked on Tuesday} = 12
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of apples picked on Wednesday:**
   - Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24
   \]

4. **Sum the total number of apples picked over the three days:**
   - Apples picked on Monday: 14
   - Apples picked on Tuesday: 12
   - Apples picked on Wednesday: 24
   \[
   \text{Total number of apples picked} = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50
   \]

Therefore, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"Lindsay started with 50 socks. She washed 10 pairs of socks, which is 20 socks (since 1 pair = 2 socks), and 15 loose socks. 

So, the total number of socks she washed is:

\[ 65 - 44 = 21 \]

Therefore, the final number of cookies left for Rachel is 21."
"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest over the five months. The interest rate is 10% per year, so for five months (which is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of a year), the interest rate is:
\[ 10\% \times \frac{5}{12} = \frac{10}{12}\% = \frac{10}{1200} = \frac{1}{120} \]

The interest on the principal amount of $3,650 for five months is:
\[ 3650 \times \frac{1}{120} = \frac{3650}{120} = 30.4167 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:
\[ 3650 + 30.4167 = 3680.4167 \]

Since she has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by 5:
\[ \frac{3680.4167}{5} = 736.08334 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the amount Karan has to pay per month is:
\[ 736.08 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{736.08} \]"
"To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's hiking speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
\[ \text{Distance Cho hiked} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's hiking speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
\[ \text{Distance Chloe hiked} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance Cho hiked} - \text{Distance Chloe hiked} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"First, let's determine the amount of silver and gold pesos Anna has.

- Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel. Since Axel has 50 silver pesos, Anna has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos.
- Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel. Since Axel has 80 gold pesos, Anna has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Next, we calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos Axel and Anna have together.

- Total silver pesos: Axel's 50 silver pesos + Anna's 100 silver pesos = \(50 + 100 = 150\) silver pesos.
- Total gold pesos: Axel's 80 gold pesos + Anna's 120 gold pesos = \(80 + 120 = 200\) gold pesos.

Finally, we add the total number of silver and gold pesos to find the total number of pesos they have together.

- Total number of pesos: \(150 + 200 = 350\).

The total number of pesos they have together is 350."
"First, let's determine the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She has 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. Therefore, the total number of cups of lemonade she can make is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to determine the total cost of the supplies. The cost is given as $18. Therefore, the profit from selling all the lemonade is:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find out how many hours it takes to sell all the lemonade, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups sold per hour:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

Therefore, the profit Millie makes per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:

\[ \$2 \]"
"To determine how much land Mr. Ruther originally had, we can follow these steps:

1. Let \( x \) represent the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially.
2. According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left.
3. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
   \]
4. To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \). We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):
   \[
   x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
   \]
5. Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
   \]

Therefore, Mr. Ruther originally had 32 hectares of land."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 52 \times 0.5 = 26 \]

On the day of the performance, only the female members are performing. So, initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform. However, half of these girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

\[ \text{Number of girls who can't make it} = 26 \times 0.5 = 13 \]

So, the number of girls who actually perform is:

\[ \text{Number of girls who perform} = 26 - 13 = 13 \]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[ \text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"

"First, let's calculate the cost for David if he buys a ride bracelet:

- A ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha if she buys tickets for each ride:

- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost per ride for Dasha is \(2 \text{ tickets} \times \$2 \text{ per ticket} = \$4\).
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \text{ rides} \times \$4 \text{ per ride} = \$36\).

Now, let's compare the total costs:

- David's total cost with the bracelet: $30.
- Dasha's total cost with tickets: $36.

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract David's cost from Dasha's cost:

\[ \$36 - \$30 = \$6 \]

Therefore, David saves \(\boxed{6}\) dollars."

\[ 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \]

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to use for the bows. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the total number of gifts:
\[ \frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ gifts}} = 12 \text{ inches per gift} \]

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

First, we need to find the total parts of the ratio:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

This means the total number of popsicles (165) is divided into 11 parts. To find the value of one part, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \( 5 \) parts, so:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \]
- Sam has \( 6 \) parts, so:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services before the bundle discount:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu costs $10 a month.
- Disney Plus costs $10 a month.

So, the total cost for these three services before the discount is:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount for bundling these services. The discount amount is:
\[ 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we compare this to the cost of the cable package, which is $60 per month. The amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable subscription and getting the streaming services is:

"First, let's calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when it is used for 8 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. Therefore, for 8 hours a day, the energy consumption is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the daily energy consumption to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Next, if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, the air conditioner will be used for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

The energy consumption for 3 hours a day is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
Converting this to kilowatts:
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is the difference between the original and reduced usage:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Therefore, the total kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:

"First, let's determine the initial number of corns Allan has. According to the problem, there are twice as much corn as cannolis, and he has 40 cannolis initially.

\[ \text{Initial number of corns} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store. Therefore, the new number of cannolis is:

\[ \text{New number of cannolis} = 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Allan also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 cannolis, the number of corns he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of corns bought} = 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Adding these 20 corns to the initial 80 corns, the new number of corns is:

\[ \text{New number of corns} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, we need to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house:

\[ \text{Combined total} = 100 \text{ (corns)} + 100 \text{ (cannolis)} = 200 \]

Therefore, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:

\[ \boxed{200} \]"

**Final Answer**: Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog."
"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:

\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we determine how long it will take Toby to read the book at his reading rate of 300 words per minute:

\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby needs to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 10 minutes to get there. Therefore, he needs to leave 10 minutes before the 60-minute mark:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Since it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, he will leave at:

\[ 50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Toby will be:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 20 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby will be 40 minutes early."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total payment for May:**
   - Number of employees hired in May: 40
   - Payment per employee per hour: $15
   - Hours worked per week: 40
   - Total payment for May = Number of employees × Payment per employee per hour × Hours worked per week
   \[
   \text{Total payment for May} = 40 \times 15 \times 40 = 24000
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of employees remaining after June:**
   - Number of employees who left in June: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\)
   - Number of employees remaining in June: \(40 - 10 = 30\)

3. **Calculate the total payment for June:**
   - Number of employees remaining in June: 30
   - Payment per employee per hour: $15
   - Hours worked per week: 40
   - Total payment for June = Number of employees × Payment per employee per hour × Hours worked per week
   \[
   \text{Total payment for June} = 30 \times 15 \times 40 = 18000
   \]

4. **Calculate the total payment for both months:**
   \[
   \text{Total payment for May and June} = \text{Total payment for May} + \text{Total payment for June} = 24000 + 18000 = 42000
   \]

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is \(\boxed{42000}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. This means the second pound of taffy is half the price of the first pound, which is $3 / 2 = $1.50. Therefore, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashells, which is $1.50.

Then, we calculate the cost of the magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25, and she bought 4 magnets, so the total cost for the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Taffy: $4.50
- Seashells: $1.50
- Magnets: $1.00

Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

Sally started with $10.00. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is:
$10.00 - $7.00 = $3.00

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the second pack of fireworks. Since it's worth twice the amount of the first pack, we have:

\[ 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

Next, we add the cost of the first pack and the second pack to find the total cost before the discount:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Tim gets a 20% discount on these fireworks. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $1200:

\[ 0.20 \times 1200 = 240 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost of the fireworks to find the discounted price:

\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted price of the fireworks:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. To find out how many cookies she needs for 30 days, we multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of days:

\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to determine how many dozens of cookies she needs to make 60 cookies:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the problem does not provide a direct percentage for candles that explode. Instead, it gives us a guarantee that the candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which implies that 1% of the candles might explode.

Given:
- Total number of candles = 50,000
- Percentage of candles that might explode = 1%
- Percentage of candles that smell like wet dog = 5% of the more dangerous candles

First, we calculate the number of candles that might explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles that might explode} = 1\% \times 50,000 = 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 500 candles also smell like wet dog. Since the problem does not specify a different percentage for the wet dog smell among the exploding candles, we assume that the 5% applies to the entire batch of candles, not just the exploding ones. Therefore, we calculate 5% of the 500 candles that might explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and might explode} = 5\% \times 500 = 0.05 \times 500 = 25 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the discounted price of each blouse. Since the blouses are on a 30% off rack, we subtract 30% from the regular price of $20.

The discount amount per blouse is:
\[ 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

So, the discounted price per blouse is:
\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost for the 4 blouses is:
\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Let's break down the information given and calculate the number of apples Joanne and her sister gathered from each type of tree.

1. **Apples from the tallest trees:**
   - Joanne gathers 30 apples.
   - Her sister gathers twice as many, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.

2. **Apples from the shortest trees:**
   - Joanne gathers half the amount she gathered from the tallest trees, which is \(\frac{30}{2} = 15\) apples.
   - Her sister gathers three times as many, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.

3. **Apples from the average trees:**
   - Joanne gathers an unknown number of apples, which we will call \(x\).
   - Her sister gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of apples:

\[
30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
150 + x = 500
\]

Solve for \(x\):

\[
x = 500 - 150
\]
\[
x = 350
\]

So, Joanne gathered \(\boxed{350}\) apples from the average trees."
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( c \) be the number of camels.
- Let \( d \) be the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each animal has one head, we have:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps is 304. Since camels have 2 humps each and dromedaries have 1 hump each, we have:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To solve for \( c \) and \( d \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we know \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
Subtracting 124 from both sides gives:
\[
d = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days:
\[ 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \]

Next, we calculate the distance he traveled over the next two days, which is 30% of the distance traveled in the first four days:
\[ 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \]

On the following day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is:
\[ 0 \text{ km} \]

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days:
\[ 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \]

Now, we sum up all the distances:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ 3140 \text{ km} \]"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the size of Zack's locker based on the size of Peter's locker.
2. Use the size of Zack's locker to find the size of Timothy's locker.

Given:
- Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
- Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker.
- Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker.

First, let's find the size of Zack's locker:
\[ \text{Size of Zack's locker} = 4 \times \text{Size of Peter's locker} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, let's find the size of Timothy's locker:
\[ \text{Size of Timothy's locker} = 2 \times \text{Size of Zack's locker} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the elevation of Stanley's comb.
2. Identify the elevation of Oliver.
3. Calculate the difference in elevation between Oliver and Stanley's comb.

First, Stanley's comb fell 4,000 feet from his initial elevation of 10,000 feet. Therefore, the elevation of the comb is:
\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Next, Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we subtract his current elevation from the elevation of the comb:
\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb \(\boxed{3000}\) feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To determine how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money Mr. Josue received from the second bank.
2. Add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital he had.

First, we know that the first bank gave Mr. Josue $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so we calculate:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we add the amounts from both banks to his initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, the total capital Mr. Josue has now is:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.

First, four boats came and each carried away 5 cats:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cats} \]

Subtract the 20 cats that were carried away from the initial 50 cats:
\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \text{ cats} \]

Next, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \text{ cats} \]

Subtract the 18 cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining 30 cats:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \text{ cats} \]

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is:
\[ 12 \]"
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the costs based on the different pricing periods.

1. **First 6 months at $8 per month:**
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 per month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96
   \]

3. **The remaining 10 months (since 2 years is 24 months, and 6 + 8 = 14 months, so 24 - 14 = 10 months) at $14 per month:**
   \[
   10 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$140
   \]

Now, we add up all these costs to get the total cost for 2 years:
\[
\$48 + \$96 + \$140 = \$284
\]

**Final numerical answer:**
\[
\$284

"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The problem states that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:
\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out the total amount Cole saved. The problem states that Cole saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can set up the following equations:
\[ \text{Savings from jogger jeans} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
\[ \text{Savings from tattered jeans} = 6 - 2 = 4 \]

Now, let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as \( J \) and the original price of the tattered jeans as \( T \). The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, and the sale price of the tattered jeans is $28. The savings from the jogger jeans is \( J - 22 \) and the savings from the tattered jeans is \( T - 28 \). According to the problem, the savings from the jogger jeans is $2 and the savings from the tattered jeans is $4. Therefore, we have:
\[ J - 22 = 2 \]
\[ T - 28 = 4 \]

Solving these equations, we get:
\[ J = 22 + 2 = 24 \]
\[ T = 28 + 4 = 32 \]

The problem asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. Therefore, we need to find the difference between the original prices of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans:
\[ T - J = 32 - 24 = 8 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum these capacities.

1. **Buses:**
   - Number of buses: 4
   - Capacity per bus: 60 employees
   - Total capacity for buses: \( 4 \times 60 = 240 \) employees

2. **Minibusses:**
   - Number of minibusses: 6
   - Capacity per minibus: 30 employees
   - Total capacity for minibusses: \( 6 \times 30 = 180 \) employees

3. **Minivans:**
   - Number of minivans: 10
   - Capacity per minivan: 15 employees
   - Total capacity for minivans: \( 10 \times 15 = 150 \) employees

Now, we sum the capacities of all the vehicles to find the total number of employees that can join the day trip:

\[
240 \text{ (buses)} + 180 \text{ (minibusses)} + 150 \text{ (minivans)} = 570 \text{ employees}

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is **570**."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others, making a total of 6 bird feeders.
2. Initially, each feeder attracts 20 birds.
3. The feeders Lillian built herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones.

Let's denote the number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders as \( x \). Therefore, the feeders Lillian built herself attract \( x + 10 \) birds.

Since there are 3 store-bought feeders and 3 homemade feeders, we can set up the following equations based on the number of birds each type of feeder attracts:

- Store-bought feeders: \( 3x \)
- Homemade feeders: \( 3(x + 10) \)

The total number of birds attracted by all the feeders is the sum of the birds attracted by the store-bought and homemade feeders:

\[
3x + 3(x + 10)
\]

Simplify the expression:

\[
3x + 3x + 30 = 6x + 30
\]

We know that initially, each feeder attracts 20 birds, so the total number of birds attracted by 6 feeders would be:

\[
6 \times 20 = 120
\]

Since the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, we can set up the equation:

\[
6x + 30 = 120
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
6x + 30 = 120
\]
\[
6x = 90
\]
\[
x = 15
\]

So, each store-bought feeder attracts 15 birds, and each homemade feeder attracts \( 15 + 10 = 25 \) birds.

Now, calculate the total number of birds:

- Store-bought feeders: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \)
- Homemade feeders: \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \)

Total number of birds:

\[
45 + 75 = 120
\]

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see \(\boxed{120}\) birds in her garden each day."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, which costs $4. 

To find 25% of $4:
\[ 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the soup costs:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the cake. The cake is half the price of the bagel:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, we add up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake to find the total cost of the dinner:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money Kenny needs to buy the ticket and have $50 in spending cash:**
   - Ticket cost: $100
   - Spending cash: $50
   - Total amount needed: $100 + $50 = $150

2. **Calculate the number of cards Kenny sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5
   - Total amount from selling cards: $150
   - Number of cards sold: $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards

3. **Determine the total number of cards Kenny started with:**
   - Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells the rest.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of cards Kenny started with.
   - He keeps 1/3 of them, so he sells 2/3 of them.
   - Number of cards sold: \( \frac{2}{3}x \)
   - We know from step 2 that \( \frac{2}{3}x = 100 \)
   - Solving for \( x \): \( x = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150 \)

Therefore, Kenny started with 150 cards."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare enough hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them getting two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is 18 guests.
   - Therefore, 18 guests would get 2 hotdogs each, and the other 18 guests would get 1 hotdog each.
   - The total number of hotdogs prepared is \(18 \times 2 + 18 \times 1 = 36 + 18 = 54\) hotdogs.

2. **Actual Guests and Consumption:**
   - 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog.
   - This means that 20 guests would need a second hotdog (since 40 guests / 2 = 20 guests wanting a second hotdog).

3. **Hotdogs Needed:**
   - The 18 guests who were initially supposed to get 2 hotdogs each would need 36 hotdogs in total (18 guests \(\times\) 2 hotdogs).
   - The 18 guests who were initially supposed to get 1 hotdog each would need 18 hotdogs in total (18 guests \(\times\) 1 hotdog).
   - Therefore, the total number of hotdogs needed for the initial 36 guests is \(36 + 18 = 54\) hotdogs.

4. **Additional Hotdogs Needed:**
   - Since 40 guests showed up and 20 of them wanted a second hotdog, an additional 20 hotdogs are needed.
   - The total number of hotdogs required is \(54 + 20 = 74\) hotdogs.

5. **Hotdogs Available:**
   - The caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs initially.

6. **Hotdogs Shortage:**
   - The shortage of hotdogs is \(74 - 54 = 20\) hotdogs.
   - Since 20 guests wanted a second hotdog and there are 20 hotdogs short, 20 guests did not get a second hotdog.

**Final Answer:**
20 guests did not get a second hotdog."
"First, let's determine the number of letters in half of Indras' name. Indras' name has 6 letters, so half of that is:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we need to find out how many letters are in her sister's name. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, so we add 4 to 3:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, we add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name together:

\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is:

\[ 13 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Set of mixing bowls: $20.00
- 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each: \(5 \times 5 = 25.00\)

Adding these together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165.00, we calculate:
\[ 165.00 \times 0.80 = 132.00 \]

Therefore, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
\[ \boxed{132.00} \]"

Money needed = Total cost - Total money Dora has
Money needed = $19 - $18 = $1

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"First, let's determine how many dragons Prince Arthur slew. Since Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, and Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons, we calculate:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Next, we find out how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Now, we need to determine how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much gasoline each container holds. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needs in gallons. Josey needs \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons by 8 pints per gallon:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"First, let's calculate how much money George had left after his purchases. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Money left} = 5 \times 0.01 = 0.05 \]

This means George spent:

\[ 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the 3 bags of chips:

\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars:

\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, or $0.75. To find out how many candy bars he bought, we divide the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:

\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many lollipops Ray shared with his friends. Ray originally had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, the number of lollipops he shared is:

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \]

Next, we need to divide these 20 lollipops equally among his four friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide 20 by 4:

\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \]

So, each of Ray's friends received \(\boxed{5}\) lollipops."
"Rory's cake weighs 20 ounces in total and is cut into 8 pieces. If Rory and her mom each have one piece, that means 2 pieces have been eaten. Since the cake was divided equally, each piece weighs:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} \]

So, the weight of the 2 pieces eaten is:

\[ 2 \text{ pieces} \times 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the remaining weight of the cake is:

\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have together:

Sitti has 34 oranges, and Juris has 22 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is:
\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Next, we need to determine how many people will be sharing these oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing the oranges with their 6 other friends, so the total number of people is:
\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people to find out how many oranges each person will get:
\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, each person will get \(\boxed{7}\) oranges."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine will use. He doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. Therefore, he will use:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound, so the cost for 4 pounds is:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is on sale for $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock is:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Adding the cost of the onions and the beef stock gives us the total cost of the ingredients:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00/\text{serving} \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is:

\[ \$2.00 \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for Bernadette to be driven to the theater. Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to be driven to the theater and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long, we calculate:

\[ 4 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to leave 5 minutes earlier than Wayne's departure time to account for the additional 12 minutes (16 minutes - 4 minutes) of travel time.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 17 \text{ minutes} \]"
"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of Billie's room in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, so we can solve for the width:
\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
\[ P = 2 \times (9 + 40) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:
\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought:

- Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads.
- Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 3 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 3 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought:

- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.
- Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 7 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 7 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other:

\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking Process**:
   - Marcus spends 3 hours baking.
   - Every hour, the temperature increases by 5 degrees.
   - Therefore, over 3 hours, the temperature increases by \(3 \times 5 = 15\) degrees.
   - The new temperature after baking is \(40 + 15 = 55\) degrees.

3. **Cooling Process**:
   - Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes.
   - The window cools the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes.
   - In 30 minutes, the temperature decreases by \(3 \times 2 = 6\) degrees (since 30 minutes is 3 times 10 minutes).
   - The final temperature after opening the window is \(55 - 6 = 49\) degrees.

Therefore, the house's final temperature is **49 degrees**."
"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time James took for the swim is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon. So, the time James took for the bike ride is:
\[ 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( x \) be the time James took for the run. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, the total time for James is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

So, the time James took for the run is 59 minutes."
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C into minutes. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is equal to \(1.25 \times 60 = 75\) minutes.

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B is \(75 + 5 = 80\) minutes.

Now, we know that Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. Therefore, the length of Movie A is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20\) minutes.

So, the length of Movie A is 20 minutes."
"First, let's determine how far Michael's horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

1. **Calculate the distance the horse runs:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time} = 30 \text{ minutes} = \frac{30}{60} \text{ hours} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount of hay consumed:**
   \[
   \text{Hay consumed} = \text{Distance} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail per mile}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Hay consumed} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail per mile} = 8 \text{ bails}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the hay:**
   \[
   \text{Cost per bail} = \$3

"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has:

- She uses 4 dozen eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs.
- She also uses 2 additional eggs that were loose in the cupboard.

So, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Since each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 5:

\[
\frac{50}{5} = 10 \text{ glasses of eggnog}
\]

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. To find out how many trays she can put out, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses each tray can hold:

\[
\frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ trays}
\]

Therefore, Rozanne can put out \(\boxed{2}\) trays."

Next, let's calculate Marcy's new score after her turn. Marcy initially has 225 points and scores an additional 10 points.

\[ 225 + 10 = 235 \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Joey's and Marcy's new scores to determine by how many points Joey is winning.

\[ 240 - 235 = 5 \]

Joey is now winning by 5 points."
"First, let's calculate the cost per sneaker. The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576. Therefore, the cost per sneaker is:

\[ \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday. The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each:

\[ \text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars} \]

The remaining sneakers are:

\[ 48 - 17 = 31 \text{ sneakers} \]

These were sold to a department store for $25 each:

\[ \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars} \]

The total revenue from all sales is:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost of the sneakers is $576. Therefore, the profit is:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars} \]

The salesman's profit is:

\[ \boxed{539} \]"

"Let's break down the costs and savings step by step.

1. **Cost of Super Ticket with Popcorn and Soda:**
   - Super ticket: $20
   - Popcorn and soda (extra $1): $1
   - Total cost with super ticket: $20 + $1 = $21

2. **Cost of Regular Ticket with Popcorn and Soda:**
   - Regular ticket: $12
   - Popcorn: $x (unknown)
   - Soda: $3
   - Total cost without super ticket: $12 + $x + $3 = $15 + $x

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - Therefore, the cost of the regular ticket plus the cost of popcorn and soda minus the cost of the super ticket equals $2 in savings.
   - Mathematically, this is: ($15 + $x) - $21 = $2

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - $15 + x - 21 = 2
   - $x - 6 = 2
   - $x = 2 + 6
   - $x = 8

The regular price of the popcorn is $8."
"First, let's determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the initial day. Given that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900, we can calculate the cost per balloon as follows:

\[ \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{\$900}{20} = \$45 \]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = \$45 + \$20 = \$65 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for filling 170 balloons at the new price:

\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times \$65 \]

To find the total cost, we perform the multiplication:

\[ 170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5) \]
\[ 170 \times 60 = 10200 \]
\[ 170 \times 5 = 850 \]
\[ 10200 + 850 = 11050 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Bentley to fill 170 balloons after the price increase is:

\[ \boxed{11050} \]"
"To find the car's average speed during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then divide the total distance by the total time.

1. **Calculate the distance for the first part of the trip:**

The car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."
"First, let's determine how many sapphires Jenna has after the trade. Initially, she has 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, so she is left with:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]

Next, we calculate the value of the sapphires she has left. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of her 5 sapphires is:

\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find the value of the 2 rubies she received in the trade. Since each ruby is worth $1200, the value of her 2 rubies is:

\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total value of all her jewels, we add the value of the sapphires and the value of the rubies:

\[ 4000 + 2400 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total value of all her jewels is:

\[ \boxed{6400} \]"
"Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. 

First, calculate the number of apples each person eats in 30 days:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Since both Marin and Nancy are eating apples, we need to add the apples eaten by both:
\[ 120 \text{ apples} + 120 \text{ apples} = 240 \text{ apples} \]

So, the total number of apples they eat in 30 days is:
\[ 240 \]

"First, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed. The volume of a raised bed is given by its width, length, and height:

\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume of soil} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{\$/bag} = 1920 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, the potting soil will cost Bob $1920."
"First, let's determine the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = Number of red cards + 60% of the number of red cards
Number of green cards = 15 + 0.60 * 15
Number of green cards = 15 + 9
Number of green cards = 24

Next, we calculate the number of yellow cards. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the number of red and green cards:

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24
Number of yellow cards = 39

Now, we sum up all the cards:

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39
Total number of cards = 78

Therefore, the total number of cards is 78."
"Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. After twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies join the group. Half of 50 is 25, so 25 more fairies joined the original 50, making the total:

\[ 50 + 25 = 75 \]

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. Subtracting these from the total gives:

\[ 75 - 30 = 45 \]

Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is:

\[ 45 \]"
"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

Total number of puppies = 8 (Jennifer's) + 12 (Brandon's) = 20 puppies

Total number of puppies with spots = 3 (Jennifer's) + 4 (Brandon's) = 7 puppies

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

Therefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots."
"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed.

1. **Hay:**
   - Each bale weighs 75 pounds.
   - The farmer buys 42 bales.
   - Total weight of hay = \( 42 \times 75 = 3150 \) pounds.

2. **Oats:**
   - Each sack weighs 65 pounds.
   - The farmer buys 20 sacks.
   - Total weight of oats = \( 20 \times 65 = 1300 \) pounds.

3. **Carrots:**
   - Each bag weighs 12 pounds.
   - The farmer buys 4 bags.
   - Total weight of carrots = \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) pounds.

4. **Sugar cubes:**
   - Each box weighs 1 pound.
   - The farmer buys 2 boxes.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) pounds.

Next, we sum the weights of all the feed:
\[ 3150 \text{ (hay)} + 1300 \text{ (oats)} + 48 \text{ (carrots)} + 2 \text{ (sugar cubes)} = 4500 \text{ pounds} \]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since a fraction of a trip is not possible):
\[ \frac{4500}{2250} = 2 \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."
"First, let's calculate how much Grayson earns from recycling aluminum cans in a week. She recycles three aluminum cans, and each can is worth two cents. Therefore, the weekly earnings from cans are:

\[ 3 \text{ cans} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from recycling plastic bottles in a week. She recycles five plastic bottles, and each bottle is worth three cents. Therefore, the weekly earnings from bottles are:

\[ 5 \text{ bottles} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents} \]

Now, let's find out how much she earns in total from recycling both cans and bottles in a week:

\[ 6 \text{ cents} + 15 \text{ cents} = 21 \text{ cents} \]

Since we need to find out how much she earns in a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by four:

\[ 21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 84 \text{ cents} \]"
"First, let's determine how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

\[ \text{Toni's plants} = \text{Frederick's plants} + 0.60 \times \text{Frederick's plants} \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 0.60 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 16 \]

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate the number of plants Shondra has as follows:

\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = \text{Toni's plants} - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 16 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 9 \]

Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants."

Therefore, the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man is $18."
"Let's break down Finley's position changes step by step:

1. She started in first place.
2. She fell back 5 spots: \(1 - 5 = -4\). Since she can't be in a negative spot, we adjust this to the last possible position, which is 10th place (since there are 10 positions in a race of this nature).
3. She then moved ahead 2 spots: \(10 - 2 = 8\). So, she is now in 8th place.
4. She fell behind 3 spots: \(8 - 3 = 5\). So, she is now in 5th place.
5. Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot: \(5 - 1 = 4\). So, she is now in 4th place.

Therefore, Finley finished in 4th place."
"First, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has:

Next, let's calculate the total number of baseball cards:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 40 \text{ cards/box} = 200 \text{ baseball cards} \]

Now, let's find the total number of cards Miss Maria has:

\[ 150 \text{ basketball cards} + 200 \text{ baseball cards} = 350 \text{ cards} \]

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is:

\[ 350 \text{ cards} - 50 \text{ cards} = 300 \text{ cards} \]

If each student receives 10 cards, the number of students Miss Maria has is:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ cards}}{10 \text{ cards/student}} = 30 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students."
"First, let's calculate how much Becky paid for her apples.

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each:
\[ 20 \times 0.45 = 9.00 \text{ dollars} \]

After receiving a $1 discount, Becky's final payment is:
\[ 9.00 - 1.00 = 8.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for her apples.

Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Kelly received a 10 percent discount on her total purchase. First, we calculate 10 percent of $10.00:
\[ 10.00 \times 0.10 = 1.00 \text{ dollar} \]

Subtracting the discount from the total, Kelly's final payment is:
\[ 10.00 - 1.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we find the difference between what Kelly and Becky paid:
\[ 9.00 - 8.00 = 1.00 \text{ dollar} \]

Therefore, Kelly paid $1.00 more than Becky."
"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we need to calculate the number of each type of laundry item per room and then multiply by the number of rooms.

1. **Sheets per room**: 2
2. **Comforter per room**: 1
3. **Pillow cases per room**: Since there are twice as many pillow cases as sheets, we have \(2 \times 2 = 4\)
4. **Towels per room**: Since there are twice as many towels as pillow cases, we have \(2 \times 4 = 8\)

Now, we sum up the total number of pieces of laundry per room:
\[2 \text{ (sheets)} + 1 \text{ (comforter)} + 4 \text{ (pillow cases)} + 8 \text{ (towels)} = 15 \text{ pieces per room}\]

For 80 rooms, the total number of pieces of laundry is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of shoes**: Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.

2. **Shoes received on Monday**: He gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, he receives \(5 \times 2 = 10\) shoes on Monday.
   - Total shoes after Monday: \(200 + 10 = 210\).

3. **Shoes received on Wednesday**: He gains 15 pairs of shoes.
   - Total shoes after Wednesday: \(210 + (15 \times 2) = 210 + 30 = 240\).

4. **Shoes received on Friday**: He gains 30 pairs of shoes.
   - Total shoes after Friday: \(240 + (30 \times 2) = 240 + 60 = 300\).

5. **Shoes removed on Saturday**: He gets rid of 180 shoes.
   - Total shoes after Saturday: \(300 - 180 = 120\).

So, the final number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday is **120**."
"First, we need to determine the total number of cupcakes Mary can decorate with all her sprinkles. Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and Mary has 6 jars, we calculate the total number of cupcakes as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ jars} \times 8 \text{ cupcakes/jar} = 48 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pans of cupcakes Mary should bake. Each pan holds 12 cupcakes. To find the number of pans, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold:

\[ 48 \text{ cupcakes} \div 12 \text{ cupcakes/pan} = 4 \text{ pans} \]

Therefore, Mary should bake 4 pans worth of cupcakes. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the piece of paper. The pen costs $2. The piece of paper costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen. 

Three times the price of the pen is:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of pencils at the start of the year. There are 30 students, and each student started with 10 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils is:

\[ 30 \times 10 = 300 \]

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. So, the number of pencils used is:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \]

This means the number of pencils remaining after two months is:

\[ 300 - 60 = 240 \]

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. So, the number of pencils left is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80 \]

Therefore, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is:

\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the combined length of the remoras. Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the total length of the remoras is:

\[ 6 \, \text{inches} \times 2 = 12 \, \text{inches} \]

Next, we need to convert the shark's body length from feet to inches to make the units consistent. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the shark's body length in inches is:

\[ 10 \, \text{feet} \times 12 \, \text{inches/foot} = 120 \, \text{inches} \]

Now, we calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents. The formula for percentage is:

\[ \left( \frac{\text{part}}{\text{whole}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \left( \frac{12 \, \text{inches}}{120 \, \text{inches}} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 10\% \]"
"Let's denote the total number of students at that grade level as \( x \).

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer. This means that one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{4}x = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 4:
\[
x = 20 \times 4 = 80
\]

Therefore, the total number of students at that grade level is \( 80 \)."
"To determine how long Jason needs to walk each day, we first need to calculate the total number of days he will be walking over the three weeks.

Since there are 7 days in a week, three weeks would be:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days} \]

Jason plans to walk 4 days a week. Over three weeks, he will walk:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ days} \]

The total time required to break in the shoes is 240 minutes. To find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day, we divide the total time by the number of days he will be walking:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{12 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Therefore, Jason needs to spend 20 minutes walking each day."
"To determine how many books each child received, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Sarah bought.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of kids.

First, we find the total number of books Sarah bought. Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we divide the total amount spent by the cost per book:
\[
\text{Total number of books} = \frac{300}{15} = 20
\]

Next, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of kids to find out how many books each child received. Sarah has 4 kids, so we divide the total number of books by 4:
\[
\text{Books per child} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

Therefore, each child received \(\boxed{5}\) books."
"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find out how many kids are allergic to at least one of the substances (dairy or peanuts).

Let's define:
- \( D \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( P \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

We are given:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

We need to find the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. This can be calculated using the formula for the union of two sets:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances.

Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - |D \cup P| = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to consider both the employees and the tour guides.

\[ 3 \text{ groups} \times 200 \text{ employees/group} = 600 \text{ employees} \]

Next, calculate the total number of tour guides:
\[ 3 \text{ groups} \times 7 \text{ tour guides/group} = 21 \text{ tour guides} \]

Now, add the total number of employees and tour guides to get the total number of people going on the tour:
\[ 600 \text{ employees} + 21 \text{ tour guides} = 621 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the total number of people going on this tour is:
\[ 621 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel during the busy weekend. The normal price is $1500 per day, and it is 20% more expensive during the busy weekend.

The increase in price is:
\[ 1500 \times 0.20 = 300 \]

So, the cost per day during the busy weekend is:
\[ 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Each ticket costs $5000, and since there are two tickets, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the trip is:
\[ \boxed{15400} \]"
"First, let's determine how many tubes of blue paint Jasper has. Since Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, and Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint, we calculate:

\[ \text{Tubes of blue paint Jasper has} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Next, we calculate how many tubes of yellow paint Jasper has. Since Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, and Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint, we calculate:

\[ \text{Tubes of yellow paint Jasper has} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

Now, we add the tubes of blue and yellow paint that Jasper has to find the total number of tubes of paint:

\[ \text{Total tubes of paint Jasper has} = 2 + 9 = 11 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 11 \]"
"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we first need to determine the weight of the 2010 penny based on the information given.

1. The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains.
2. The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny.

To find the weight of the 2010 penny:
\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \text{ grains} \]
\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = 36 \text{ grains} \]

Now, we add the weight of the 1959 penny and the 2010 penny to find the combined weight:
\[ \text{Combined weight} = 48 \text{ grains} + 36 \text{ grains} \]
\[ \text{Combined weight} = 84 \text{ grains} \]

Therefore, the combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains."
"To find out how much more Keegan and Tashay needed to earn to reach their goal, we first need to calculate the total amount they have already earned and then subtract this from their goal.

1. Calculate the total amount earned by Keegan and Tashay by 3 pm:
   - Keegan earned $83.
   - Tashay earned $91.
   - Total earned = $83 + $91 = $174.

2. Subtract the total amount earned from their goal of $200 to find out how much more they need to earn:
   - Goal = $200.
   - Amount needed = $200 - $174 = $26.

Therefore, Keegan and Tashay need to earn $26 more to reach their goal."
"First, let's determine how many songs Luri has on her portable media player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

So, Luri has 60 songs on her player.

Next, we need to find out how many more songs each can add to their players. Since each player can store up to 100 songs, we subtract the number of songs each currently has from 100.

For Gabriel:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]

For Luri:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]

Now, to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:
\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Therefore, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to her player than Gabriel can add to his.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 40 \]"
"First, we need to determine how many oranges Stetson ate. Since he ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 oranges they picked, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. According to the bet, he gives up $10 for each orange he eats. Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is:

\[
24 \times 10 = 240

So, James runs a total of 6 hours a week."
"To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the daily consumption of oats for one horse:**
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, the daily consumption for one horse is \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).

2. **Calculate the daily consumption of oats for all four horses:**
   - Since there are four horses, the total daily consumption is \(10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).

3. **Calculate the total consumption of oats for five days:**
   - The total consumption for five days is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).

4. **Determine the number of bags needed:**

"First, we calculate the number of Pomeranians Jana has. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can find this number by calculating two thirds of 27:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 27 = 18
\]

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians. Next, we need to find out how many of these Pomeranians are girls. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, so we calculate one third of 18:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
\]

Therefore, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians. 

\[

"First, let's determine the cost of 2 packs of razors before any discounts. Each pack costs $4.00, so 2 packs cost:

\[ 2 \times 4.00 = 8.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the razors are on sale with a ""buy one get one free"" offer, Heather only needs to pay for 1 pack to get the second one free. Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is the same as the cost of 1 pack:

\[ 4.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the $2.00 coupon to the $4.00 cost:

\[ 4.00 - 2.00 = 2.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many razors Heather gets. Since each pack contains 4 razors and she buys 2 packs, she gets:

\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ razors} \]

The cost per razor is the total cost after the coupon divided by the number of razors:

\[ \frac{2.00 \text{ dollars}}{8 \text{ razors}} = 0.25 \text{ dollars per razor} \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents):

\[ 0.25 \text{ dollars} \times 100 = 25 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost per individual razor is:

\[ 25 \text{ cents} \]"
"To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to identify the height of the shortest cheerleader, as she will be at the top of the pyramid.

Given:
- 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64"" tall.
- The 10th cheerleader is 60"" tall.

The shortest cheerleader is 60"" tall.

Since the height of the human pyramid is determined by the height of the shortest cheerleader at the top, the height of the human pyramid is 60 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we use the conversion factor that 1 foot = 12 inches.

\[ \text{Height in feet} = \frac{60 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height of the human pyramid is 5 feet."

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, we need to find out how many oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley. Therefore, the total number of oranges Brianne brought is:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, we add the oranges brought by Ashley and Brianne to find the total number of oranges they have together:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

To find out how many Greek orange pies they can make, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges required for one pie. Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges, the number of pies they can make is:

"To determine the number of guests at which the two venues become equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests by \( x \).

**Cost at the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost at the second venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (which includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

To solve for \( x \), we first isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation:
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( \boxed{10} \)."
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \(D\), by Lily as \(L\), and by Bodhi as \(B\).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \(L + D + B = 43\)
2. \(L = D + 7\)
3. \(D = \frac{1}{2}B\)

First, we can express \(B\) in terms of \(D\):
\[B = 2D\]

Next, we substitute \(L\) and \(B\) in terms of \(D\) into the first equation:
\[L + D + B = 43\]
\[(D + 7) + D + 2D = 43\]
\[4D + 7 = 43\]

Now, solve for \(D\):
\[4D = 36\]
\[D = 9\]

Now that we know \(D = 9\), we can find \(L\) and \(B\):
\[L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16\]
\[B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18\]

So, Lily found \(16\) insects.

"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the amount of yarn each of them used and then add those amounts together.

First, let's calculate the amount of yarn Mariah used:
Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the amount of yarn Mariah's grandma used:
Her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein of yarn. So we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we add the amounts of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma:
\[ 91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, the total amount of yarn they used altogether is:

4. One pack is green apple, which costs half as much as the grape pack, so it costs $1.
5. The total cost for all four packs is $7.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

The total cost equation can be written as:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

Each pack of strawberry gum costs $2."
"To determine the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to consider the cost and the number of sticks he can get from each type of wood. 

First, let's calculate the number of sticks he can get from each type of wood:
- From a 2 x 4 piece of wood, he can get 200 sticks.
- From a 2 x 8 piece of wood, he can get 400 sticks.

Next, let's determine the cost of each type of wood:
- A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4.
- A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6.

Since Frederick has $24 to spend, we need to see how many of each type of wood he can buy and how many sticks he can get from them.

If he buys only 2 x 4 pieces:
- With $24, he can buy \( \frac{24}{4} = 6 \) pieces of 2 x 4 wood.
- Each piece gives 200 sticks, so 6 pieces give \( 6 \times 200 = 1200 \) sticks.

If he buys only 2 x 8 pieces:
- With $24, he can buy \( \frac{24}{6} = 4 \) pieces of 2 x 8 wood.
- Each piece gives 400 sticks, so 4 pieces give \( 4 \times 400 = 1600 \) sticks.

Comparing the two options, buying 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood gives him 1600 sticks, which is more than the 1200 sticks he would get from buying 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood.

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make if he buys the cheapest lumber (2 x 8 pieces) is 1600.

"First, we need to determine the total number of legs Mario's sled dogs have. Since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, we can calculate the total number of legs as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of snowshoes are required. Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we can calculate the number of pairs needed as follows:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs} \]

Finally, we need to calculate the total cost of the snowshoes. Since each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, the total cost is:

\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times \$12.00 \text{ per pair} = \$144.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:

\[ \$144.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of Janet's bus trips without the weekly bus pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day, and each trip costs $2.20. Therefore, the cost per day is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times \$2.20/\text{trip} = \$4.40/\text{day} \]

Since she takes these trips five days a week, the weekly cost without the pass is:
\[ \$4.40/\text{day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = \$22.00/\text{week} \]

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the weekly bus pass, which is $20.00.

The savings from buying the weekly bus pass would be the difference between the cost of not having the pass and the cost of the pass:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Janet would save:
\[ \$2.00 \]"
"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. According to the problem:

1. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. However, the farm has 30 cows, so this statement is not relevant to the number of cows on the farm.
2. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has \(20 \div 2 = 10\) sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals:

- The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, so the farm has \(30 + 10 = 40\) animals.
- The zoo has 20 sheep, so the zoo has 20 animals.

Therefore, the total number of animals in the farm and the zoo combined is \(40 + 20 = 60\).

60"
"To determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start by analyzing the information given:

- Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.
- Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.

First, we calculate the number of onions Sophia bought. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions that Sophia bought, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \text{Number of onions Sophia bought} \times 4 = 12 \]
\[ \text{Number of onions Sophia bought} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the number of potatoes Sophia bought. Similarly, since Rose bought 4 times the number of potatoes that Sophia bought, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \text{Number of potatoes Sophia bought} \times 4 = 4 \]
\[ \text{Number of potatoes Sophia bought} = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

Now, we add the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought to find the total:
\[ \text{Total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought} = 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought at the market is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total calorie deficit needed:**
   Andy wants to lose 30 pounds. Since it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, the total calorie deficit required is:
   \[
   30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105,000 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of days available:**
   Today is December 31st, and Andy's birthday is July 19th. The number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:
   - January: 31 days
   - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
   - March: 31 days
   - April: 30 days
   - May: 31 days
   - June: 30 days
   - July (up to July 19th): 19 days

   Adding these up:
   \[
   31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190 \text{ days}
   \]

3. **Calculate the daily calorie deficit:**
   To find out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days:
   \[
   \frac{105,000 \text{ calories}}{190 \text{ days}} \approx 552.63 \text{ calories/day}
   \]

Therefore, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 553 calories to reach his goal."
"Gerald earns $30 every day. Since he worked for an entire week, he worked for 7 days. Therefore, his total earnings for the week are:

\[ 30 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ dollars} \]

Gerald spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

\[ 210 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 110 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Gerald has \(\boxed{110}\) dollars left."
"First, calculate the total distance Hannah will run:

Each lap is 0.25 km, and she runs 8 laps, so the total distance is:
\[ 0.25 \, \text{km/lap} \times 8 \, \text{laps} = 2 \, \text{km} \]

Next, calculate the total amount of water she needs to drink:

Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. Since she runs 2 km, the total amount of water is:
\[ 60 \, \text{ml/km} \times 2 \, \text{km} = 120 \, \text{ml} \]

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water."
"First, let's calculate how much Julie spent on clothes. She spent 20% of $500 on clothes:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 500 = 0.20 \times 500 = 100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on clothes. Now, let's find out how much money she has left after buying clothes:

\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on CDs. Now, let's find out how much money she has left after buying CDs:

\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Julie has left is:

\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the house cost is $90,000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags that Tara bought. She bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, at $4 per pack. 

Total cost = Number of packs × Cost per pack
Total cost = 8 × $4
Total cost = $32

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags. She sold each bag for $8. Since she bought 8 packs of 5 bags each, she had a total of 40 bags.

Total revenue = Number of bags × Selling price per bag
Total revenue = 40 × $8
Total revenue = $320

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $320 - $32
Profit = $288

Therefore, Tara earned a profit of $288 on her bags."
"To determine the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of punches Joe throws per round.
2. Multiply the number of punches per round by the number of rounds in the fight.

First, we know that Joe throws 25 punches per minute. Each round lasts 3 minutes. Therefore, the number of punches Joe throws in one round is:
\[ 25 \text{ punches/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 75 \text{ punches/round} \]

Next, the fight consists of 5 rounds. So, the total number of punches Joe throws in the entire fight is:
\[ 75 \text{ punches/round} \times 5 \text{ rounds} = 375 \text{ punches} \]

Thus, the total number of punches Joe threw is:
\[ \boxed{375} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially.

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. So, the total amount from the $10 bills is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount from the $20 bills is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Ali has:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister. So, the amount given to his sister is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

The remaining amount of money Ali has after giving half to his sister is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, let's convert Rob's time into minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, Rob takes \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes to shingle a house.

According to the problem, Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes. So, we need to calculate double Rob's time and then add 40 minutes to it.

Double Rob's time is \(2 \times 120 = 240\) minutes.

Adding 40 minutes to this gives us \(240 + 40 = 280\) minutes.

Therefore, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house."

"First, let's determine the picking rate for each individual:

1. **Tony's rate**: Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
2. **Bobby's rate**: Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby's rate is \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
3. **Kathy's rate**: Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy's rate is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) quarts per hour.
4. **Ricky's rate**: Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so Ricky's rate is \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Next, we sum the rates to find the total number of quarts picked per hour by all four individuals:

\[
6 \text{ (Tony)} + 5 \text{ (Bobby)} + 10 \text{ (Kathy)} + 8 \text{ (Ricky)} = 29

"First, let's calculate Ada's current weekly electric consumption and cost.

1. **Current Daily Consumption:**
   - Ada consumes 12 kilowatts per hour daily.

2. **Current Weekly Consumption:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day, so her daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh) is:
     \[
     12 \text{ kWh/day}
     \]
   - There are 7 days in a week, so her weekly consumption is:
     \[
     12 \text{ kWh/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ kWh/week}
     \]

3. **Current Weekly Cost:**
   - The cost per kilowatt-hour is $1.50, so her weekly cost is:
     \[
     84 \text{ kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$126/\text{week}
     \]

Next, let's calculate Ada's new weekly electric consumption and cost after adding the new device.

4. **New Daily Consumption:**
   - The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour daily.
   - Therefore, her new daily consumption is:
     \[

"First, let's determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house (since 5 days for half a house means 10 days for a whole house).

Next, we need to find out the rate at which 5 people can paint a house. Since 5 people working together would paint 5 times faster than one person, we divide the time it takes one person to paint a whole house by 5.

So, the time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ days}}{5} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Now, we need to convert the time from days to hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply the number of days by 24:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"First, let's determine the number of chairs Ophelia has. According to the problem, Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Since Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = \text{Number of sofas Ophelia has} + 2 = 20 + 2 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Therefore, the number of chairs Jenna has is:

\[ \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 3 \times \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = 3 \times 22 = 66 \]

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the number of sofas Jenna has is:

\[ \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} = \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together. The total number of sofas is:

\[ \text{Total number of sofas} = \text{Number of sofas Ophelia has} + \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} = 20 + 64 = 84 \]

The total number of chairs is:

\[ \text{Total number of chairs} = \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} + \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 22 + 66 = 88 \]

Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs that they have is:

\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = \text{Total number of sofas} + \text{Total number of chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{172} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the headphone set. We know that Tom bought a CD for $4 and the total amount he paid was $48. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set can be calculated as follows:

Total cost - Cost of CD = Cost of headphone set
$48 - $4 = $44

So, the headphone set costs $44.

Next, we need to find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set. If he did not buy the headphone set, he would have had the full $48 to spend on CDs. Since each CD costs $4, we can calculate the number of CDs he could buy by dividing the total amount of money by the cost of one CD:

Number of CDs = Total amount of money / Cost of one CD
Number of CDs = $48 / $4
Number of CDs = 12

Since Tom originally bought one CD, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is:

12 - 1 = 11

Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

11"
"To find the total number of hours Josh has spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours.

1. For 6 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week.
2. For 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week.
3. For 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours.

Let's calculate the total hours:

- For the 6 weeks at 4 hours each: \(6 \times 4 = 24\) hours.
- For the 2 weeks at 5 hours each: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
- For the 1 week at 6 hours: \(1 \times 6 = 6\) hours.

Now, we add these amounts together to get the total number of hours:

\[24 + 10 + 6 = 40\]

So, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40 hours."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
5. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

The final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{66}\)."
"First, let's determine Jame's current age. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, then his current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\).

Next, we need to find out how old Jame will be in 8 years. In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\).

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, we calculate twice Jame's age in 8 years and then subtract 5:
\[2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55.\]
This means that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 55 years old.

To find out Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55:
\[55 - 8 = 47.\]

Now, we need to find out how many years separate Jame's current age from his cousin's current age:
\[47 - 22 = 25.\]

So, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Given that the computer cost $1,100 and Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can determine the cost of the printer as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of the printer} = \text{Cost of the computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We can set up the following equation to find the cost of one monitor:

\[ \text{Cost of the computer} + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} + \text{Cost of the printer} = 2400 \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 1100 + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} + 700 = 2400 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 1800 + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = 2400 \]

Subtract 1800 from both sides:

\[ 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = 600 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ \text{Cost of one monitor} = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300."
"The boys brought back 60 seashells each. According to the problem, the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.

Let's denote the number of seashells brought by each girl as \( G \).

The problem states that each girl brought \( 60 + 4 \times 60 \) seashells.

So, we calculate:
\[ G = 60 + 4 \times 60 \]
\[ G = 60 + 240 \]
\[ G = 300 \]

Each girl brought 300 seashells.

Final numerical answer:
300"
"First, determine how many candies George originally had. Since George ate 5 candies and now has 3 left, he originally had:

\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ candies} \]

So, Nick has \(\boxed{16}\) candies."
"First, let's determine Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

\[ \text{Alyana's age} = \text{Chenny's age} - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6 \]

Next, we need to find Anne's age. Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so we add 2 to Alyana's age:

\[ \text{Anne's age} = \text{Alyana's age} + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8 \]

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old."
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to determine the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so its thickness is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so its thickness is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we add the thicknesses of all four books:
\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62\]

First, add 31 and 50:
\[31 + 50 = 81\]

Next, add 45 to the result:
\[81 + 45 = 126\]

Finally, add 62 to the result:
\[126 + 62 = 188\]

Therefore, the total thickness of the four books is \(\boxed{188}\) mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make to reach her goal of 72 vlogs per month, we first need to calculate how many vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

Adding these together:
\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

So, Emma has made 54 vlogs in the first three weeks. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make to reach her goal of 72 vlogs, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:
\[ 72 - 54 = 18 \]

Therefore, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month.

18"
"First, let's calculate the total bill including the tip.

1. The original bill is $50.
2. The tip is 20% of $50.

To find the tip:
\[ \text{Tip} = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, the total bill including the tip is:
\[ \text{Total bill} = 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Since the check is to be split evenly, each person pays half of the total bill:
\[ \text{Each person's share} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Therefore, you end up paying:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's determine how much each boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, each boy initially gets:

\[ \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The eldest boy then added $5 to his share:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

The following day, he added another $10:

\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

He then spent $8:

\[ 21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

After spending $8, he tripled the amount he had left:

\[ 13 \times 3 = 39 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount the eldest boy has is:

\[ \boxed{39} \]"
"To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April, we first need to understand the structure of the month and the saving pattern.

April has 30 days, which can be divided into two halves:
- First half: 15 days
- Second half: 15 days

Let's denote the daily savings in the first half of April as \( x \). Therefore, the total savings for the first half of April would be \( 15x \).

According to the problem, Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half of April. So, the daily savings in the second half would be \( 2x \). The total savings for the second half of April would then be \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

Elvis's total savings target for the month is $1125. Therefore, the sum of the savings from both halves of the month should equal $1125:
\[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \]
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of April. Since he saves twice as much in the second half, his daily savings in the second half would be:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of the month."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples, oranges, and peaches that Verna bought.

1. **Cost of apples:**
   \[
   3 \text{ apples} \times \$1.50 \text{ per apple} = \$4.50
   \]

2. **Cost of oranges:**
   \[
   5 \text{ oranges} \times \$0.80 \text{ per orange} = \$4.00
   \]

3. **Cost of peaches:**
   \[
   6 \text{ peaches} \times \$0.75 \text{ per peach} = \$4.50
   \]

Next, we add up the total cost of all the fruits:
\[
\$4.50 + \$4.00 + \$4.50 = \$13.00
\]

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave:
\[
\$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00
\]

Therefore, the change Verna received is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]"
"To determine how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we need to calculate the total earnings for each and then find the difference.

First, calculate Jairus's total earnings:
- Jairus earns $0.8 per task.
- He completed 20 tasks.
- Therefore, Jairus's total earnings = $0.8 * 20 = $16.

Next, calculate Jenny's total earnings:
- Jenny earns $0.5 per task.
- She also completed 20 tasks.
- Therefore, Jenny's total earnings = $0.5 * 20 = $10.

Now, find the difference between Jairus's and Jenny's earnings:
- Difference = Jairus's earnings - Jenny's earnings = $16 - $10 = $6.

So, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny."
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."
"Jeff walks to work and back home each day, which is a total of 3 miles to work and 3 miles back, making it 6 miles per day. If he works 5 times a week, the total distance he walks in a week is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Five notebooks at $1.50 each: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)
- Two pens at $0.25 each: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
- One calculator at $12 each: \(1 \times 12 = 12.00\)
- One geometry set at $10 each: \(1 \times 10 = 10.00\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00\]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Daniel has to spend:
\[30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00\]

Therefore, Daniel has to spend \(\boxed{27.00}\) on all the items he wants to buy."

"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned from her sales, we need to break down the commission calculation into two parts: the commission for the first $1000 and the additional commission for the amount over $1000.

1. **Commission for the first $1000:**
   - Commission rate for the first $1000 is 30%.
   - Commission amount = $1000 * 30% = $1000 * 0.30 = $300.

2. **Commission for the amount over $1000:**
   - Antonella sold goods worth $2500, so the amount over $1000 is $2500 - $1000 = $1500.
   - Additional commission rate for the amount over $1000 is 10%.
   - Additional commission amount = $1500 * 10% = $1500 * 0.10 = $150.

3. **Total commission:**
   - Total commission = Commission for the first $1000 + Additional commission for the amount over $1000.
   - Total commission = $300 + $150 = $450.

Therefore, the amount of money Antonella earned is $450."
"First, let's calculate the total number of water bottles Bill already has. He has 2 cases of water, with each case containing 24 bottles. Therefore, the total number of bottles he has is:

\[ 2 \text{ cases} \times 24 \text{ bottles/case} = 48 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles Bill expects to give out. He has 70 guests and wants to provide 2 bottles per guest. Therefore, the total number of bottles needed is:

\[ 70 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ bottles/guest} = 140 \text{ bottles} \]

To find out how many additional bottles Bill needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles needed:

"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does in cold water. 

In cold water, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. Therefore, twice this time is:
\[ 2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding 2 minutes to this time gives:
\[ 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes on a warm day.

Next, we need to find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a warm day compared to a cold day. 

On a cold day, the time to swim 3 miles is:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

On a warm day, the time to swim 3 miles is:
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- So, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to get the total number of rodents:
- Total number of rodents = Number of hamsters + Number of guinea pigs
- Total number of rodents = \(30 + 15 = 45\).

Therefore, the pet shop had a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's determine the weight of each person:

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

From the problem, we know:
- Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so \( S = 44 \).
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be \( 44 + 7 = 51 \) years old.
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, in 7 years, his nephew will be \( N + 7 \) years old.

We can set up the following equation based on the information given:
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Now, let's solve for \( N \):
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]
\[ N = \frac{30}{3} \]
\[ N = 10 \]

"First, let's determine how much money Peter spends each day. Since he has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days), we divide $70 by 7:

\[ \frac{70}{7} = 10 \]

So, Peter spends $10 each day.

Next, we calculate how much money Peter spends from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spends $10 each day for 4 days, the total amount spent is:

\[ 10 \times 4 = 40 \]

Now, we determine how much money Peter has left after Wednesday. He started with $70 and spent $40, so:

\[ 70 - 40 = 30 \]

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. We need to find out how many days he has left to spend his remaining $30. Since he has 4 days left (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), we can calculate how many plastic action figures he can buy:

\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

So, he can buy 15 plastic action figures.

Now, we calculate the total number of action figures he buys. From Sunday through Wednesday, he bought wooden action figures. Since he spent $10 each day for 4 days and each wooden action figure costs $5, the number of wooden action figures he bought is:

\[ \frac{10}{5} \times 4 = 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Adding the wooden and plastic action figures together, the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is:

\[ 8 + 15 = 23 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{23} \]"

\]

The total cost so far is $308."
"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per week.
2. Determine the number of weeks in a month (assuming an average month has about 4 weeks).
3. Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.
4. Compare the total number of roses Ford grows in a month with the total number of roses he needs to supply to the flower shops in a month.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per week.**

The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. Therefore, the total number of roses supplied per week is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of weeks in a month.**

We assume an average month has 4 weeks.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.**

Ford grows 40 roses every week. Therefore, in a month (4 weeks), he grows:
\[ 40 \times 4 = 160 \text{ roses} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of roses Ford needs to supply to the flower shops in a month.**

Ford needs to supply 65 roses per week to the flower shops. Therefore, in a month (4 weeks), he needs to supply:
\[ 65 \times 4 = 260 \text{ roses} \]

**Step 5: Determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month.**

Ford grows 160 roses in a month but needs 260 roses to supply the flower shops. Therefore, the number of roses he lacks is:
\[ 260 - 160 = 100 \text{ roses} \]

**Final Answer:**
Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To determine how much money Katina will have in her savings account after 2 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money removed from the account over 2 years.
2. Subtract this total from the initial amount in the account.

First, we calculate the total amount of money removed from the account over 2 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, 2 years would be 24 months. Katina removes $100 each month, so over 24 months, she will remove:
\[ 100 \text{ dollars/month} \times 24 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account:
\[ 3000 \text{ dollars} - 2400 \text{ dollars} = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money remaining in the account after 2 years is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total revenue and the total cost, and then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.
   - Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Cost of bread: Each loaf costs $3.00 and makes 10 sandwiches.
     - Cost of bread for 10 sandwiches = $3.00
   - Cost of cheeses and condiments: $30.00 for 10 sandwiches.
     - Cost of cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches = $30.00
   - Total cost for 10 sandwiches = Cost of bread + Cost of cheeses and condiments
     - Total cost for 10 sandwiches = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

3. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
     - Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

**Final numerical answer:**

"First, let's determine the total number of crayons Kate has. She has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each:

\[ 3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ crayons} \]

Next, we need to find out how many ""muffin crayons"" she can make. Since she uses 8 small pieces of crayon to make one muffin crayon, we divide the total number of crayons by 8:

\[ 192 \div 8 = 24 \text{ muffin crayons} \]

Now, if Kate sells each muffin crayon for $1.50, we can calculate the total amount of money she can make by multiplying the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin crayon:

\[ 24 \times 1.50 = 36 \]

Therefore, Kate can make \(\boxed{36}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total area of Michael's bedroom:
\[ \text{Area} = 18 \, \text{feet} \times 12 \, \text{feet} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \]

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the new carpet and padding:
\[ \text{Cost of carpet and padding} = (12 \, \text{dollars/square foot} + 2 \, \text{dollars/square foot}) \times 216 \, \text{square feet} = 14 \, \text{dollars/square foot} \times 216 \, \text{square feet} = 3024 \, \text{dollars} \]

Then, we'll calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of removing old carpet} = 4 \, \text{dollars/square foot} \times 216 \, \text{square feet} = 864 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we'll calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of installing new carpet} = 34 \, \text{dollars/square foot} \times 216 \, \text{square feet} = 7344 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we'll add all these costs together to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 3024 \, \text{dollars} + 864 \, \text{dollars} + 7344 \, \text{dollars} = 11232 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is:

3. Total birds seen on days four and five: 120 birds
4. Total birds seen on day six: 20 birds
5. Total birds seen on day seven: 90 birds

Now, we add these numbers together to get the total number of birds seen over the week:
\[ 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 \]

Next, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days (7) to find the average:
\[ \frac{280}{7} = 40 \]

Therefore, on average, Mack saw 40 birds per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Diane starts with a number, which is 20.
2. She adds half of this number to it. Half of 20 is 10, so we add 10 to 20, which gives us 30.
3. This resulting value (30) is then divided by 5. So, \(30 \div 5 = 6\).
4. Next, this value (6) is multiplied by the starting value minus 12. The starting value is 20, so 20 minus 12 is 8. Therefore, we multiply 6 by 8, which gives us \(6 \times 8 = 48\).

So, the final value of the number train is \(\boxed{48}\)."

"To determine the correct temperature Maggie should set her oven to, we first need to calculate the percentage by which the oven is off. The actual temperature is 468 when Maggie sets it to 450. The difference is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage by which the oven is off is:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is 4% too hot. To find the correct setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to determine what temperature, when increased by 4%, equals 520 degrees. Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set her oven to. Then:

\[ x + 0.04x = 520 \]
\[ 1.04x = 520 \]
\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]
\[ x = 500 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees."

   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

2. The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long.
   - 2 hours = 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes
   - 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Now, we add the durations of both movies together:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate how much 30% of Herb's house price is, and then subtract that from Herb's house price.

1. Calculate 30% of Herb's house price:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } \$76,000 = 0.30 \times 76,000 = \$22,800 \]

2. Subtract this amount from Herb's house price to find the value of Juan's house:
\[ \$76,000 - \$22,800 = \$53,200 \]

3. Add the value of both houses to find the combined value:
\[ \$76,000 + \$53,200 = \$129,200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is \(\$129,200\)."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Judy bought a dozen cups. A dozen is 12, so Judy bought 12 cups.
2. Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups. Since she bought 12 cups, she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.
3. Judy's friend brought 40 cups.
4. Judy's friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend:

- Total cups brought: \(12 + 40 = 52\)
- Total dishes brought: \(24 + 44 = 68\)

Adding the total number of cups and dishes together gives us the total number of utensils:

- Total utensils: \(52 + 68 = 120\)

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two is 120."
"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount. 

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 single use contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per contact when buying 2 boxes is:
\[ \boxed{1.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours worked by Jill and John.

Jill worked:
- 2 hours on Saturday
- 1 hour on Sunday
Total hours for Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

John worked:
- Twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday
- Three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday
Total hours for John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours

Next, we calculate the earnings for each person. Since they are paid $10 per hour:

Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30
John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:

Difference in earnings = John's earnings - Jill's earnings
Difference in earnings = $70 - $30 = $40

John earned $40 more than Jill.

$40"
"First, calculate the total calories burned from aerobics and running.

- Aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
- Running: 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Next, calculate the amount of water Hannah needs to drink based on the calories burned.

- Water needed = 100 ml of water for every 200 calories
- Total water needed = (1600 calories / 200 calories) * 100 ml = 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. We can express the number of red and green jelly beans in terms of \( B \):

- Number of red jelly beans = \( B - 0.01B = 0.99B \)
- Number of green jelly beans = \( B + 0.01B = 1.01B \)

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

- Number of red jelly beans = \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Number of green jelly beans = \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:

\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains \(\boxed{30}\) more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."

"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:
\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

Now, we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is:

"First, let's convert all the coins Colby has into their equivalent value in nickels, since each gumball costs a nickel.

- Colby has 8 quarters. Since 1 quarter is worth 25 cents, 8 quarters are worth \(8 \times 25 = 200\) cents.
- Colby has 6 dimes. Since 1 dime is worth 10 cents, 6 dimes are worth \(6 \times 10 = 60\) cents.
- Colby has 14 nickels. Since 1 nickel is worth 5 cents, 14 nickels are worth \(14 \times 5 = 70\) cents.
- Colby has 15 pennies. Since 1 penny is worth 1 cent, 15 pennies are worth \(15 \times 1 = 15\) cents.

Next, we add up all the values in cents:
\[200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 \text{ cents}\]

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we divide the total amount of money Colby has by the cost of one gumball:
\[345 \div 5 = 69\]

Therefore, Colby can buy \(\boxed{69}\) gumballs."

"First, we need to determine the speed of the plane. The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. To find the speed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same speed. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds as Ruiz in one hour:

\[ 60 \times \frac{3}{4} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa can make in 12 hours. Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes:

\[ 60 \times 12 = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes:

\[ 45 \times 12 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the amounts together gives the total amount of chocolates they made together:

\[ 720 + 540 = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

\[ \boxed{1260} \]"
"To determine how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate his total spending over the three days and subtract that from his original amount of $100.

1. **Monday's Spending:**
   Howard spends $8 on Monday.

2. **Tuesday's Spending:**
   On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday. Therefore, his spending on Tuesday is:
   \[
   2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Wednesday's Spending:**
   On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday. Therefore, his spending on Wednesday is:
   \[
   4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Spending:**
   Adding up his spending over the three days, we get:
   \[
   8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Money Left:**
   Subtracting his total spending from his original amount of $100, we get:
   \[
   100 - 88 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Howard has \(\boxed{12}\) dollars left."
"To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours, we need to calculate his earnings for each period separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the earnings for the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Therefore, his earnings per hour for the first four hours were \(15 \text{ cups/hour} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$7.50/\text{hour}\).
- Over four hours, his total earnings were \(4 \text{ hours} \times \$7.50/\text{hour} = \$30.00\).

Next, let's calculate the earnings for the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Therefore, his earnings per hour for the next two hours were \(10 \text{ cups/hour} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$6.00/\text{hour}\).
- Over two hours, his total earnings were \(2 \text{ hours} \times \$6.00/\text{hour} = \$12.00\).

Finally, we sum the earnings from both periods to find the total earnings:
- Total earnings = \$30.00 + \$12.00 = \$42.00.

Therefore, the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours is \(\boxed{42}\) dollars."
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of rotations per tire per month:**
   - Every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
   - Therefore, the number of rotations per tire per month is:
     \[
     \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/rotation cycle}} \times 725 \text{ rotations} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations}

Therefore, the tire needs to be replaced after \(\boxed{6}\) years."
"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of washings per bottle:**
   - The bottle provides 120 washings when using 2 pumps per wash.

2. **Calculate the number of washings per pump:**
   - Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give half of that:
     \[
     \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump}
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost per washing:**
   - The bottle costs $24.00 and provides 120 washings:
     \[
     \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing}
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost per pump:**
   - Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost for 60 washings is:
     \[
     \text{Cost per pump} = 60 \text{ washings} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} = 12 \text{ cents per pump}
     \]

Therefore, the cost per pump is \(\boxed{12}\) cents."

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height requirement in inches.
3. Calculate the difference in height between the requirement and Adam's current height.
4. Determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required additional height.

First, convert Adam's current height from inches to feet:
\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The height requirement to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet.

Next, calculate the difference in height:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Convert the height difference from feet to inches:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year. To find out how many years it will take for him to grow 8 inches:

\text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000
\]

**Step 4: Calculate James's commission based on the profit.**

James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
\[
\text{Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500
\]

Therefore, James made \(\boxed{17500}\)."
"First, we need to determine how many riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate:

\[ 100 \text{ riders} \times 0.25 = 25 \text{ riders} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are men. We know that 60% of the riders who stay upright are women, so the remaining 40% must be men. Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is:

\[ 25 \text{ riders} \times 0.40 = 10 \text{ men} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Given:
- The price of a diamond Jewell is $2000.
- The price of a gold Jewell is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond Jewell.
- The price of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of a gold Jewell.

First, calculate the price of the gold Jewell:
\[
\text{Price of gold Jewell} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
\]

Next, calculate the price of the silver Jewell:
\[
\text{Price of silver Jewell} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, find the total price for all three jewels:
\[
\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

The total price for all three jewels is \(\boxed{4800}\)."
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and then sum them up.

1. **Snowflake Stamps**: Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. **Truck Stamps**: Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Therefore, the number of truck stamps is:
   \[
   16 + 3 = 19
   \]
3. **Rose Stamps**: Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Therefore, the number of rose stamps is:
   \[
   19 - 9 = 10
   \]

Now, we sum up all the stamps:
\[
16 \text{ (snowflake)} + 19 \text{ (truck)} + 10 \text{ (rose)} = 45
\]

Therefore, the total number of stamps Max bought is:
\[

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob. 

1. **Calculate the relative speed:**
   - Bob's speed: 55 miles per hour
   - Tom's speed: 70 miles per hour
   - Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed = 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

2. **Determine the time it takes to close the gap:**
   - Initial distance between Tom and Bob: 75 miles
   - Time = Distance / Relative Speed = 75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"First, let's determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught as follows:

\[ \text{Fish caught by Darren} = 17 - 6 = 11 \]

Next, we need to find out how many fish Tommy caught. Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so we add 3 to the number of fish Darren caught:

\[ \text{Fish caught by Tommy} = 11 + 3 = 14 \]

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish."
"First, let's calculate the cost per class if Manny attends all 10 classes. The total cost for the classes is $60, and there are 10 classes, so the cost per class is:

\[ \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars per class} \]

Since $6 is less than $10, Manny can miss some classes without his parents refusing to sign him up again. We need to determine how many classes he can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as \( x \). If he misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class in this scenario would be:

\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need this cost to be less than or equal to $10:

\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the inequality by \( 10 - x \):

\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]

\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 100 from both sides:

\[ 60 - 100 \leq -10x \]

\[ -40 \leq -10x \]

Dividing both sides by -10 (and reversing the inequality sign):

\[ 4 \geq x \]

So, \( x \leq 4 \). This means Manny can miss up to 4 classes without the cost per class exceeding $10. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of customers Julie processes daily. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, and Jewel processes 50 customers daily, Julie processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers daily.

Next, we calculate the total number of customers each processes in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week:

- Jewel processes \(50 \times 7 = 350\) customers weekly.
- Julie processes \(100 \times 7 = 700\) customers weekly.

Adding these together gives the total weekly production for the two:

\[350 + 700 = 1050\]

Therefore, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel is 1050 customers."
"Paisley ran 4 miles. 

Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, which is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) miles.

Lynn ran 17 miles."
"To determine how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to find the cost of one apple and one orange.

1. **Cost of one apple:**
   - Four apples cost $5.20.
   - Therefore, the cost of one apple is:
     \[
     \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30
     \]

2. **Cost of one orange:**
   - Three oranges cost $3.30.
   - Therefore, the cost of one orange is:
     \[
     \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10
     \]

3. **Total cost for 5 apples:**
   - The cost of one apple is $1.30.
   - Therefore, the cost of 5 apples is:
     \[
     5 \times 1.30 = 6.50
     \]

4. **Total cost for 5 oranges:**
   - The cost of one orange is $1.10.
   - Therefore, the cost of 5 oranges is:
     \[
     5 \times 1.10 = 5.50
     \]

5. **Total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:**
   - Adding the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges:
     \[
     6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00

"First, we need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it will take Bob to shovel this volume of earth. If it takes him 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, then for 72 cubic feet, the time \( T \) required is:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

Therefore, the time it will take Bob to dig the hole is:

\[ \boxed{216} \]"
"To determine the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price of the truck to the costs of the additional features.

1. **Base Price of the Truck**: $30,000
2. **King Cab Upgrade**: $7,500
3. **Leather Seats**: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade
   \[
   \text{Cost of Leather Seats} = \frac{7500}{3} = 2500
   \]
4. **Running Boards**: $500 less than the leather seats
   \[
   \text{Cost of Running Boards} = 2500 - 500 = 2000
   \]
5. **Upgraded Exterior Light Package**: $1500

Now, we sum up all the costs:
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 30000 + 7500 + 2500 + 2000 + 1500
\]

Adding these together:
\[
30000 + 7500 = 37500
\]
\[
37500 + 2500 = 40000
\]
\[
40000 + 2000 = 42000

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount Ariadne made from selling green hats in the first month.
2. Calculate the total sales for the first month.
3. Calculate the sales for the second month.
4. Sum the sales from both months to get the total amount made.

**Step 1: Determine the amount from green hats in the first month.**

We know that the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month are:
\[ 400 \times 2 = 800 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total sales for the first month.**

The total sales for the first month are the sum of the sales from red and green hats:
\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the sales for the second month.**

The sales in the second month are \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month:
\[ 1200 \times \frac{3}{4} = 900 \]

**Step 4: Sum the sales from both months to get the total amount made.**

The total amount made in two months is the sum of the sales from the first and second months:

"To determine how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sally received this week.
2. Subtract the amount she should have received (her weekly wage) from the total amount received to find out how much was withheld.

First, we find out how much money Sally received this week. Her bank account increased from $200 to $420. Therefore, the total amount received is:
\[ 420 - 200 = 220 \]

Next, we know that her weekly wage should be $300. Since she only received $220, the amount withheld from her wage is:
\[ 300 - 220 = 80 \]

So, the number of dollars withheld from Sally’s wage is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:**
   - Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves.
   - Lori is inviting 16 guests.
   - Total deviled egg halves needed = \( 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ halves/guest} = 48 \text{ halves} \).

2. **Determine the number of whole eggs needed:**
   - 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves.
   - Total whole eggs needed = \( \frac{48 \text{ halves}}{2 \text{ halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ eggs} \).

3. **Convert the number of whole eggs to dozens:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cooking Time for Rice:**
   - It took Finley 30 minutes to cook the rice.

2. **Cooking Time for Pork:**
   - It took 20 more minutes to cook the pork than the rice.
   - Therefore, the cooking time for pork = 30 minutes (rice) + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

3. **Cooking Time for Beans:**
   - The beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.
   - Combined cooking time of pork and rice = 30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) = 80 minutes.
   - Therefore, the cooking time for beans = 80 minutes / 2 = 40 minutes.

4. **Total Cooking Time:**
   - Total cooking time = cooking time for rice + cooking time for pork + cooking time for beans.
   - Total cooking time = 30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) + 40 minutes (beans) = 120 minutes.

Thus, the total time it took to cook all the food is 120 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between the two.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is \(5 + 5 = 10\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is \(2 + 5 = 7\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \(10 - 7 = 3\) dollars.

So, the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs $3 more than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of animal heads is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

We can write the following equations based on this information:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (total number of legs)

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have the system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The original brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more.

The increase in cost is:
\[ 5 \times 0.20 = 1 \]

So, the cost of the more expensive brand is:
\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, which is 7 pounds (since he uses 1 pound per day):
\[ 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

He also buys a donut for $2. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 42 + 2 = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"To determine the cost of the apple pie, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought, excluding the apple pie, and then subtract this from the total amount spent.

1. Cost of 2 bags of chips: \(2 \times \$2.00 = \$4.00\)
2. Cost of the bucket of fried chicken: \$8.00
3. Cost of the bottle of soda: \$1.00

Adding these amounts together:
\[ \$4.00 + \$8.00 + \$1.00 = \$13.00 \]

Gus spent a total of \$20.00 at the grocery store. Therefore, the cost of the apple pie is:
\[ \$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00 \]

The cost of the apple pie is \$7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

Total newspapers delivered in a day = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers - (Newspapers to District A + Newspapers to District C)

Let's calculate:

Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - (198 + 209)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 407
Newspapers delivered to District B = 193

James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John spends in the cooking class.

- The class meets 4 times a week.
- Each session is 2 hours long.
- The class runs for 6 weeks.

Total hours spent in class = 4 sessions/week * 2 hours/session * 6 weeks = 48 hours.

Next, we need to determine how many recipes John learns. He learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time.

Number of recipes learned = Total hours spent in class / Hours per recipe = 48 hours / 1.5 hours/recipe.

Now, let's perform the division:

48 / 1.5 = 32.

So, John learns 32 recipes."
"First, we need to determine the number of history teachers on the basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

This means there are 90 history teachers. Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

So, there are 60 math teachers. Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

Thus, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours."
"First, let's determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[
\text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we find out how much money Rayna has. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so:

\[
\text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add together the money that Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia have:

\[
\text{Total money} = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360 \text{ dollars}
\]

To find out how much each person would have if they shared the total money equally, we divide the total by 3:

\[
\text{Money per person} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, if they decided to add together their money and share equally, each would have \(\boxed{120}\) dollars."
"The game consists of 4 quarters, each 12 minutes long. Therefore, the total time for the 4 quarters is:

The cost of 10 candies of type B:
\[ 10 \text{ candies} \times \$0.75 \text{ per candy} = \$7.5 \]

Next, we add the costs together to find the total amount Adam spent:
\[ \$3.5 + \$7.5 = \$11 \]

Adam paid the cashier $15. To find the change he received, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid:
\[ \$15 - \$11 = \$4 \]

Therefore, the change Adam received is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine how many good days Christina had left in the month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Good Days**: Christina had 12 good days in the first 30 days.
2. **First 8 Days**: The first 8 days were all good, so she had 8 good days in the first 8 days.
3. **Second 8 Days**: The next 8 days were bad, so no good days were added here.
4. **Third 8 Days**: The following 8 days were neutral, so no good days were added here.
5. **Next 3 Days**: The next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. This adds 2 more good days (since the first and third days were good).

Now, let's calculate the total number of good days:
- Good days in the first 8 days: 8
- Good days in the next 3 days: 2

Total good days = 8 (initial) + 2 (next 3 days) = 10

Since Christina had 12 good days in total over the 30 days, the number of good days left in the month is:
12 (total good days) - 10 (good days already counted) = 2

**Final Answer:**

"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To find the value of \( S \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

Final answer:
Sally has 9 books."
"First, let's convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the current height of 20 feet is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The target height is 600 inches. To find out how much more the bamboo needs to grow to reach this height, we subtract the current height from the target height:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches, we divide the total growth needed by the daily growth rate:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - James needs to buy 8 more toys to have enough for all 12 dogs.

2. **After Buying the Toys:**
   - James now has \(4 + 8 = 12\) toys for 12 dogs.
   - The number of dogs doubles, so there are now \(12 \times 2 = 24\) dogs.
   - James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys.

3. **After Buying More Toys:**
   - James now has \(12 + 12 = 24\) toys for 24 dogs.
   - 3 dogs leave the shelter, so there are now \(24 - 3 = 21\) dogs.
   - James no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs that left.

4. **Total Number of Toys Needed:**
   - James initially needed 12 toys.
   - He then needed 12 more toys.
   - The total number of toys he needs is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is \(\boxed{24}\)."
"First, let's determine how much Dylan invested. Dylan's investment is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total amount of $1200.

\[ \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = 480 \]

After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount in the account is:

\[ 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Next, Frances invested \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining $720.

\[ \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = 480 \]

After Frances's investment, the remaining amount in the account is:

\[ 720 - 480 = 240 \]

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) centimeters.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds an additional 20 cm with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

The equation representing the final length of the dress can be written as:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

To isolate \( x \), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]

"Let's define the variables for the ages of the individuals:
- Let \( T \) be the age of one of the triplets.
- Let \( W \) be the age of one of the twins.

According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet. This gives us the equation:
\[ W = T + 7 \]

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. Since there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, we have two individuals in each set. Therefore, the combined ages can be expressed as:
\[ 2W + 3T = 44 \]

Now, substitute \( W = T + 7 \) into the combined ages equation:
\[ 2(T + 7) + 3T = 44 \]

Simplify and solve for \( T \):
\[ 2T + 14 + 3T = 44 \]
\[ 5T + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5T = 30 \]
\[ T = 6 \]

Now that we have the age of one of the triplets, we can find the age of one of the twins:
\[ W = T + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13 \]

Therefore, the age of one of the twins is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and the dog needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:

\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Let the total bill be \( x \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:

\[ 0.6x \]

The total bill \( x \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:

\[ x = 40 + 0.6x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation:

\[ x - 0.6x = 40 \]
\[ 0.4x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the number of chairs currently available from the total number of chairs needed:

\[ \text{Additional chairs needed} = \text{Total chairs needed} - \text{Total current chairs} = 57 - 48 = 9 \]

Therefore, Mia has to get \(\boxed{9}\) more chairs."
"First, we need to determine the number of bucks in the field. Since 50 percent of the 50 deer are bucks, we calculate:

\[ 50 \times 0.50 = 25 \]

So, there are 25 bucks in the field.

Next, we need to find out how many of these bucks are 8 points. Since 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points, we calculate:

\[ 25 \times 0.20 = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of 8 point bucks is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"First, let's calculate the points collected by each student:

1. **Adam's Points**: Adam has 50 points.
2. **Betty's Points**: Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. So, we calculate 30% of Adam's points and add it to Adam's points.
   \[
   \text{Betty's points} = 50 + (0.30 \times 50) = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]
3. **Tom's Points**: Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
   \[
   \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35
   \]
4. **Betty's Points (Recheck)**: We already calculated Betty's points as 65.
5. **Marta's Points**: Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom.
   \[
   \text{Marta's points} = 3 \times 35 = 105
   \]

Now, let's sum up the points collected by all students:
\[
\text{Total points} = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255
\]

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. Therefore, the class is missing:
\[
400 - 255 = 145 \text{ points}
\]

**Final Answer**: The class is missing 145 points to go on the trip."
"To determine the number of great-grandbabies at the family reunion, we can break down the family structure step by step.

1. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.
2. Each of these 3 children has 3 children of their own (grandchildren), so the total number of grandchildren is:
   \[
   3 \text{ children} \times 3 \text{ grandchildren per child} = 9 \text{ grandchildren}
   \]
3. Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies of their own (great-grandbabies), so the total number of great-grandbabies is:
   \[
   9 \text{ grandchildren} \times 3 \text{ great-grandbabies per grandchild} = 27 \text{ great-grandbabies}
   \]

Therefore, the number of great-grandbabies at the family reunion is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"First, let's calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400.00 paycheck into her retirement account:

\[ 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

So, she puts $1200.00 into her retirement account.

Next, we calculate how much she uses for her monthly car payment. She uses 20% of her $2400.00 paycheck for her car payment:

\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

So, she uses $480.00 for her car payment.

Now, we subtract the amounts she has spent from her total paycheck to find out how much she has left to spend:

\[ 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person saves a seat and buys enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats. Since each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks, and there are 20 people, the group will buy 20 drinks and 20 * 3 = 60 snacks.

The cost of each drink and each snack is $2. Therefore, the total cost for the drinks is:

\[ 20 \text{ drinks} \times 2 \text{ dollars per drink} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost for the snacks is:

\[ 60 \text{ snacks} \times 2 \text{ dollars per snack} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the cost of the drinks and the snacks together gives:

\[ 40 \text{ dollars} + 120 \text{ dollars} = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the group has spent a total of:

"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we can calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4,000 \text{ pounds} + 800 \text{ pounds} = 4,800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. We can use this information to find out how much Gary's truck can haul. Let's denote the capacity of Gary's truck as \( x \). The total capacity of the three trucks is given by:

\[ 4,000 \text{ pounds} + 4,800 \text{ pounds} + x = 11,600 \text{ pounds} \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 8,800 \text{ pounds} + x = 11,600 \text{ pounds} \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 8,800 pounds from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 11,600 \text{ pounds} - 8,800 \text{ pounds} = 2,800 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry \(\boxed{2800}\) pounds of gravel."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females.

1. **Number of females and dumplings each ate:**

"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Marcus ordered:

- Croissants: \(5 \times \$3.00 = \$15.00\)
- Cinnamon rolls: \(4 \times \$2.50 = \$10.00\)
- Mini quiches: \(3 \times \$4.00 = \$12.00\)
- Blueberry muffins: \(13 \times \$1.00 = \$13.00\)

Next, we add these amounts to find the total before the discount:
\[
\$15.00 + \$10.00 + \$12.00 + \$13.00 = \$50.00
\]

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his purchase. To find the discount amount:
\[
10\% \text{ of } \$50.00 = 0.10 \times \$50.00 = \$5.00

"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can get with $6.00, we need to consider the deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's calculate the cost for 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free):
\[ 2 \text{ scoops} \times \$1.50/\text{scoop} = \$3.00 \]

So, for every $3.00, Erin gets 3 scoops of ice cream.

Now, let's see how many sets of 3 scoops Erin can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{\$6.00}{\$3.00/\text{set}} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set gives her 3 scoops, 2 sets will give her:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops/set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream with $6.00.

"To determine how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy each person eats in that time and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total amount of candy Ginger eats in two weeks:
- Ginger eats 4 pieces a day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- Therefore, Ginger eats \(4 \times 14 = 56\) pieces of candy in two weeks.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of candy Amy eats in two weeks:
- Amy eats 3 pieces a day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- Therefore, Amy eats \(3 \times 14 = 42\) pieces of candy in two weeks.

Now, we need to find out how much candy each person has left after two weeks:
- Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56 pieces, so she has \(100 - 56 = 44\) pieces left.
- Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42 pieces, so she has \(100 - 42 = 58\) pieces left.

Finally, we find the difference in the amount of candy they have left:
- Amy has 58 pieces and Ginger has 44 pieces.
- The difference is \(58 - 44 = 14\).

Therefore, after two weeks, Amy has \(\boxed{14}\) more pieces of candy than Ginger."
"First, calculate the area that Mr. Boarden wants to cover, which is two thirds of his 36 square feet bathroom.

\[ \text{Area to cover} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \, \text{sq ft} = 24 \, \text{sq ft} \]

Next, since he needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot, we calculate the total number of tiles needed for 24 square feet.

\[ \text{Total tiles needed} = 24 \, \text{sq ft} \times 24 \, \text{tiles/sq ft} = 576 \, \text{tiles} \]

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 square feet bathroom."
"To determine how much James saved, we need to calculate the total cost of picking blueberries and compare it to the cost of buying the same amount at the store.

1. **Cost of picking blueberries:**

"To calculate the total calories in John's omelet, we need to consider the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

1. **Eggs**: John uses 6 eggs.
   - Each egg is 75 calories.
   - Total calories from eggs = \(6 \times 75 = 450\) calories.

2. **Cheese**: John uses 2 oz of cheese.
   - Each ounce of cheese is 120 calories.
   - Total calories from cheese = \(2 \times 120 = 240\) calories.

3. **Ham**: John uses an equal amount of ham as cheese, which is 2 oz.
   - Each ounce of ham is 40 calories.
   - Total calories from ham = \(2 \times 40 = 80\) calories.

Now, we add up all the calories:

"First, calculate the total cost of the pencils:
- Cost of one pencil = $0.50
- Number of pencils = 6
- Total cost of pencils = $0.50 * 6 = $3.00

Next, calculate the total cost of the erasers:
- Cost of one eraser = $0.25
- Number of erasers = 8
- Total cost of erasers = $0.25 * 8 = $2.00

Now, add the total cost of pencils and erasers to find the overall cost:
- Total cost = Cost of pencils + Cost of erasers
- Total cost = $3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00

Finally, subtract the total cost from the amount paid to find the change:
- Amount paid = $10.00
- Change = Amount paid - Total cost
- Change = $10.00 - $5.00 = $5.00

Therefore, the change you would get is $5.00."

"To find the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we need to calculate the number of taps for each foot separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of taps for each foot when her arms are down (3 minutes):
- Right foot: 300 taps per minute
- Left foot: 250 taps per minute

For 3 minutes with her arms down:
- Right foot: \(300 \, \text{taps/minute} \times 3 \, \text{minutes} = 900 \, \text{taps}\)
- Left foot: \(250 \, \text{taps/minute} \times 3 \, \text{minutes} = 750 \, \text{taps}\)

Next, let's calculate the number of taps for each foot when her arms are raised (2 minutes):
- Right foot: 200 taps per minute
- Left foot: 200 taps per minute

For 2 minutes with her arms raised:
- Right foot: \(200 \, \text{taps/minute} \times 2 \, \text{minutes} = 400 \, \text{taps}\)
- Left foot: \(200 \, \text{taps/minute} \times 2 \, \text{minutes} = 400 \, \text{taps}\)

Now, we sum the taps for both feet:
- Total right foot taps: \(900 + 400 = 1300 \, \text{taps}\)
- Total left foot taps: \(750 + 400 = 1150 \, \text{taps}\)

"First, let's determine the total number of pizzas ordered. Since Bryce and his four friends each ordered one pizza, the total number of pizzas is:

\[ 1 + 4 = 5 \]

Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends. Each of these three people ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizza. Therefore, the number of slices each of them ate is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \]

Since there are three people (Bryce and his two friends) who each ate 8 slices, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we calculate the number of slices eaten by the remaining two friends. Each of these two friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizza. Therefore, the number of slices each of them ate is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \]

Since there are two people who each ate 9 slices, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Adding the slices eaten by all five friends, we get:

\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \]

Finally, to find the number of slices left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:

\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \]

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. The dog can eat the sausages in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes. Since the cat takes 30 minutes, the dog takes:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 30 = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the average time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages. The average time is the sum of the times divided by 2:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is:

\[
25 \text{ minutes}

"First, we need to convert the length of one of Topher's shoes into inches. Topher's shoe length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the feet to inches as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Adding the additional 4 inches:

\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. The relationship can be expressed as:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for both students' cars and teachers' cars separately, and then sum these values.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each students' car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The number of students' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 64 = 16 \]

Since each of these 16 cars has 4 windows, the total number of windows smashed for the students' cars is:
\[ 16 \times 4 = 64 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teachers' car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

The number of teachers' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 32 = 24 \]

Since each of these 24 cars has 2 windows, the total number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars is:
\[ 24 \times 2 = 48 \]

Finally, we sum the windows smashed for both students' cars and teachers' cars:
\[ 64 + 48 = 112 \]

Therefore, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:
\[ \boxed{112} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of spools Candy has:

- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45
- Light green spools: 40
- Dark green spools: 50

Total spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

Next, we calculate the number of blue spools:

- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45

Total blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\% \]

Therefore, 40% of Candy's spools are blue."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of people**: 5000

2. **People who voted by midday (12:00)**: 
   - By midday, \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the people had voted.
   - Number of people who voted by midday = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \).

3. **Remaining people after midday**:
   - Remaining people = Initial number - Number of people who voted by midday
   - Remaining people = 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

4. **People who voted by 16:00**:
   - By 16:00, \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining people had voted.
   - Number of people who voted by 16:00 = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \).

5. **Remaining people who had not voted by 16:00**:
   - Remaining people = Remaining people after midday - Number of people who voted by 16:00
   - Remaining people = 3000 - 2000 = 1000.

**Final answer**: 1000 people had not voted by 16:00."
"To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need to last him 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will need for 30 days.
2. Determine how many packs of gum are required based on the number of pieces per pack.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will need for 30 days:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we determine how many packs of gum are needed. Since each pack contains 15 pieces of gum, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Parker will need \(\boxed{8}\) packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total number of smores needed:

- Each of the 9 kids wants 2 smores, so the kids will need \(9 \times 2 = 18\) smores.
- Each of the 6 adults will eat 1 smore, so the adults will need \(6 \times 1 = 6\) smores.
- In total, they will need \(18 + 6 = 24\) smores.

Next, we need to determine how many graham cracker sleeves are required to make 24 smores. Since each sleeve makes the base for 8 large smores:

- The number of sleeves needed is \(\frac{24}{8} = 3\) sleeves.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, they will need 1 box of graham crackers.

"First, let's determine Dora's father's age. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate her father's age as follows:

\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we need to find Dora's mother's age. The problem states that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, we can calculate her mother's age as follows:

\[ \text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Now, we need to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother. We do this by adding their individual ages together:

\[ \text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:

\[ \boxed{87} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to divide the total amount of money Greg found by the number of people who will share it, including Greg himself.

1. Total amount of money found: $20
2. Number of people sharing the money: Greg + 3 siblings = 4 people

Now, we divide the total amount by the number of people:

"First, let's break down the weights of each book:

- Math books: 2 pounds each
- Science books: 2 pounds each
- French book: 4 pounds
- English book: 3 pounds
- History book: twice the weight of the English book, which is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds

Now, let's sum up the weights:

- Math books: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds (assuming she has 2 math books)
- Science books: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds (assuming she has 2 science books)
- French book: 4 pounds
- English book: 3 pounds
- History book: 6 pounds

Adding these together:

\[4 \text{ (math)} + 4 \text{ (science)} + 4 \text{ (French)} + 3 \text{ (English)} + 6 \text{ (history)} = 21 \text{ pounds}\]

So, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 21 pounds."
"First, let's determine how many votes candidate A received. Since candidate A got 20% of the votes and there were 100 voters, we calculate:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate A} = 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

Next, we need to find out how many votes candidate B received. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. Therefore, we calculate 50% of candidate A's votes and add it to candidate A's votes:

\[ \text{50% of candidate A's votes} = 50\% \times 20 = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Now, we can find out how many votes candidate C received by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (\text{Votes for candidate A} + \text{Votes for candidate B}) \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Therefore, candidate C received 50 votes."
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck initially has. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we can calculate Beck's initial number of apples as follows:

\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \]

So, Beck initially has 77 apples.

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. After this transaction, Boris will have:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]

And Beck will have:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this exchange. We do this by subtracting the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris.

"First, let's calculate the amount of water used for each type of ice cube:

1. **Giant cubes**: Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water. Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   \[
   3 \text{ giant cubes} \times 4 \text{ ounces per cube} = 12 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Medium cubes**: Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water. Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   \[
   7 \text{ medium cubes} \times 2 \text{ ounces per cube} = 14 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Small cubes**: Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water. Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   \[
   8 \text{ small cubes} \times 0.5 \text{ ounces per cube} = 4 \text{ ounces}
   \]

Next, we add up the total amount of water used:
\[
12 \text{ ounces} + 14 \text{ ounces} + 4 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}
\]

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how much water he has left, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount:
\[
32 \text{ ounces} - 30 \text{ ounces} = 2 \text{ ounces}
\]

Therefore, Peter has \(\boxed{2}\) ounces of water left."
"To solve this problem, let's start by determining how many books Steven has. We know that Clara has two times as many books as Steven, and Clara has 20 books. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many books Steven has:

\[ \text{Number of books Steven has} = \frac{\text{Number of books Clara has}}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, Steven has 10 books.

Next, we need to find out how many books Alice has. We know that Alice has 6 more books than Steven. Therefore, we can calculate the number of books Alice has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of books Alice has} = \text{Number of books Steven has} + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice. We know Clara has 20 books and Alice has 16 books. Therefore, the difference in the number of books between Clara and Alice is:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Number of books Clara has} - \text{Number of books Alice has} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. According to the problem, a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5, we can set up the following equation to find the cost of a half-gallon jar:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 5 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars. Since each gallon jar costs $5, the total cost for 10 gallon jars is:

\[ \text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars. Since each half-gallon jar costs $3, the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:

\[ \text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Finally, we add the two amounts together to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 50 + 48 = 98 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"To determine how many students like to play video games, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total number of students**: 50
2. **Students who like to bake**: 10
3. **Students who like to play basketball**: 5
4. **Students who like to play music**: This is twice the number of students who like to play basketball, so \(2 \times 5 = 10\).

Now, we can calculate the number of students who like to play video games by subtracting the number of students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music from the total number of students.

\[
\text{Students who like to play video games} = \text{Total students} - (\text{Students who like to bake} + \text{Students who like to play basketball} + \text{Students who like to play music})
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
\text{Students who like to play video games} = 50 - (10 + 5 + 10) = 50 - 25 = 25
\]

So, the number of students who like to play video games is \(\boxed{25}\)."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total number of students in both classes**: 80 students.
2. **Number of students in each class**: Since the two classes have the same number of students, we divide the total number of students by 2.
   \[
   \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40
   \]
3. **Percentage of girls in each class**: 40% of the students in each class are girls.
4. **Number of girls in each class**: To find the number of girls, we calculate 40% of 40.
   \[
   \text{Number of girls in each class} = 0.40 \times 40 = 16
   \]
5. **Number of boys in each class**: Since the total number of students in each class is 40 and 16 of them are girls, the number of boys is:

"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

1. **Calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays in one 4-week month:**
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays.
   - Each weekday, 60 chairs are rented.
   - Therefore, in one 4-week month, \(20 \times 60 = 1200\) chairs are rented during weekdays.

2. **Calculate the number of chairs rented during weekends in one 4-week month:**
   - There are 2 weekend days in a week.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.
   - Each weekend day, 100 chairs are rented.
   - Therefore, in one 4-week month, \(8 \times 100 = 800\) chairs are rented during weekends.

3. **Calculate the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month:**
   - Total chairs rented in one 4-week month = chairs rented during weekdays + chairs rented during weekends.
   - Total chairs rented in one 4-week month = \(1200 + 800 = 2000\).

4. **Calculate the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months:**
   - Total chairs rented in two 4-week months = total chairs rented in one 4-week month \(\times 2\).
   - Total chairs rented in two 4-week months = \(2000 \times 2 = 4000\).

Therefore, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is **4000**."

"First, let's break down the trades Lorraine makes.

1. **Small Stickers to Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers.
   - She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so she gets 27 small buttons.

2. **Large Stickers to Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 40 large stickers.
   - She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = \(0.5 \times 40 = 20\) large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so she gets \(20 \times 3 = 60\) large buttons.

3. **Remaining Large Stickers to Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so she gets \(20 \times 3 = 60\) small buttons.

Now, let's sum up all the buttons Lorraine has:

- Small buttons from trading small stickers: 27
- Large buttons from trading large stickers: 60
- Small buttons from trading remaining large stickers: 60

Total buttons = 27 (small) + 60 (large) + 60 (small) = 147 buttons.

Therefore, Joey played a total of 7 matches in one week."
"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which means the sum of the votes in favor and against the regulation is 33. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into this expression:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need size extra-small.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need size small as extra-small. So, \(2 \times 11 = 22\) students need size small.
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So, \(22 - 4 = 18\) students need size medium.
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need size large as size medium. So, \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\) students need size large.
5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need size extra-large than large. So, \(9 + 6 = 15\) students need size extra-large.

Now, let's sum up the total number of shirts:

\[
11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75
\]

So, Krissa ordered a total of 75 shirts."

\[ 60000 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many people think horse #2 will win. Since 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after accounting for those who think horse #2 will win:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, 60% of these remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. So, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

This means 24 people think horse #7 will win.

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. To find out how many people this is, we subtract the number of people who think horse #2 or horse #7 will win from the total number of people:

\[ 50 - 10 - 24 = 16 \]

So, the number of people who think that horse #12 will win is:

"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of Pomeranians:**
   - We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls.
   - There are 6 Pomeranian girls.
   - Therefore, the total number of Pomeranians is \( 6 \times 3 = 18 \).

2. **Determine the total number of puppies:**
   - We know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians.
   - Since there are 18 Pomeranians, and they represent two thirds of the total number of puppies, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Total Puppies} = 18
     \]
   - Solving for the total number of puppies:
     \[
     \text{Total Puppies} = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27

"First, let's determine how much money Ava gave to Jayden. Ava has $90 and she gave Jayden half of it. So, we calculate half of $90:

\[
\frac{90}{2} = 45
\]

Next, we add the $45 that Ava gave to Jayden to the $70 Jayden already had:

\[
70 + 45 = 115
\]

Now, we need to find out how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera, which costs $200. We subtract the amount of money Jayden has from the cost of the camera:

\[
200 - 115 = 85
\]

Therefore, Jayden needs \(\boxed{85}\) more dollars to buy the camera."
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = \frac{7}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 7x = 500 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 7:
\[ x = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases of shingles. Substituting \( x \) with \( \frac{500}{7} \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Since the problem asks for the final numerical answer, we can round to the nearest whole number if necessary, but the exact answer is:
\[ \frac{1000}{7} \]

So, the third house will need \(\boxed{\frac{1000}{7}}\) cases of shingles."

"First, let's calculate how many pears George has. Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, we can find the number of pears by calculating 45% of the number of bananas and then adding that to the number of bananas.

Number of bananas = 200

45% of 200 bananas = 0.45 * 200 = 90 pears

So, the number of pears George has is 200 bananas + 90 pears = 290 pears.

Now, to find the total number of fruits George has, we add the number of bananas and the number of pears:

Total number of fruits = Number of bananas + Number of pears
Total number of fruits = 200 + 290 = 490

Therefore, George has 490 fruits in total."

"First, let's determine how many books Ahmed read in one hour. According to the problem, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour. Since Ezra read 300 books, we can set up the following equation to find out how many books Ahmed read:

\[ \text{Number of books Ahmed read} = \frac{\text{Number of books Ezra read}}{2} = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

Next, we need to account for the additional books Ezra decided to read. Ezra read 150 more books, so the total number of books Ezra has read is:

\[ 300 + 150 = 450 \]

Now, we add the number of books Ahmed read to the total number of books Ezra has read to find the total number of books they have read altogether:

\[ 150 + 450 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total number of books they have read altogether is:

\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"To calculate Tanya's earnings for the two days, we need to break down her earnings based on the hours she worked and the additional payment for teaching more than 3 classes.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour, so for 5 hours, she earns \(5 \times 15 = 75\) dollars.
- Since she taught more than 3 classes, she gets an additional $5, so her total for Monday is \(75 + 5 = 80\) dollars.

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour, so for 2 hours, she earns \(2 \times 15 = 30\) dollars.
- Since she did not teach more than 3 classes, she does not get the additional $5.

**Total Earnings:**
- Adding the earnings from Monday and Wednesday, Tanya's total earnings are \(80 + 30 = 110\) dollars.

"First, let's calculate the total amount of time Tatiana has for her weekend activities:

\[ 7 \text{ hours (Saturday)} + 5 \text{ hours (Sunday)} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that she spends 3 hours reading. So, the remaining time is:

\[ 12 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Tatiana plays video games for \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the remaining 9 hours:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can find out how much time she spends playing soccer by subtracting the time spent on reading and video games from the total remaining time:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours (reading)} - 3 \text{ hours (video games)} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

To find the percentage of her weekend that she spends playing soccer, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \left( \frac{\text{time spent playing soccer}}{\text{total time}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{12 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

1. **Enemies Jumped On:**
   - Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
   - Points for each enemy = 10 points.
   - If Emma jumps on \( E \) enemies, then Ava jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies.
   - Points from enemies for Emma = \( 10E \).
   - Points from enemies for Ava = \( 10(E + 8) = 10E + 80 \).

2. **Berries Collected:**
   - Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
   - Points for each berry = 5 points.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond: 3 orange and 4 white.
2. He bought 17 more fish from the pet store, bringing the total number of fish in the pond to \(7 + 17 = 24\).
3. After adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as \(w\) and the number of orange fish he bought as \(o\). Therefore, the total number of white fish in the pond is \(4 + w\) and the total number of orange fish is \(3 + o\).

According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
\[3 + o = 2(4 + w)\]

We also know that the total number of fish bought is 17:
\[o + w = 17\]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \(3 + o = 2(4 + w)\)
2. \(o + w = 17\)

First, simplify the first equation:
\[3 + o = 8 + 2w\]
\[o - 2w = 5\]

Now we have the simplified system:
1. \(o - 2w = 5\)
2. \(o + w = 17\)

We can solve these equations simultaneously. From the second equation, express \(o\) in terms of \(w\):
\[o = 17 - w\]

Substitute this expression for \(o\) into the first equation:
\[17 - w - 2w = 5\]
\[17 - 3w = 5\]
\[12 = 3w\]
\[w = 4\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To verify, substitute \(w = 4\) back into the equation \(o + w = 17\):
\[o + 4 = 17\]
\[o = 13\]

Now check the condition that the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
\[3 + 13 = 16\]
\[2(4 + 4) = 2 \times 8 = 16\]

The condition is satisfied. Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is \(\boxed{4}\)."

"To determine the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the yield from the tomato plants and the eggplant plants separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the yield from the tomato plants:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo has 5 tomato plants.
- Therefore, the total yield from the tomato plants is \( 22 \times 5 = 110 \) tomatoes.

Next, we calculate the yield from the eggplant plants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants.
- Therefore, the total yield from the eggplant plants is \( 4 \times 8 = 32 \) eggplants.

Finally, we sum the yields from both types of plants to find the total number of fruits:
- Total fruits = \( 110 \) tomatoes + \( 32 \) eggplants = \( 142 \) fruits.

Thus, the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants is \(\boxed{142}\)."
"To determine the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to calculate the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold.

"To determine how much money John is missing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the trip.
2. Determine how much the school will contribute.
3. Calculate how much John still needs to raise.

The total cost of the trip is $300. The school will cover half of this cost, which is:
\[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

So, the school will contribute $150. This means John needs to cover the other half of the cost, which is also $150. John currently has $50. Therefore, the amount of money John still needs to raise is:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \]

Thus, the amount of money John is missing is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, we need to determine the temperature during the night. If it is 33 degrees colder at night compared to the day, and the day temperature is 45 degrees, then the night temperature is:

\[ 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, we need to find out how much the temperature needs to be raised to prevent the pipes from freezing. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. Therefore, the temperature needs to be raised from 12 degrees to 32 degrees:

\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Since each log of wood burns raises the temperature by 5 degrees, we need to calculate how many logs are required to raise the temperature by 20 degrees:

\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

Therefore, Carson needs to burn \(\boxed{4}\) logs to prevent the pipes from freezing."
"First, we need to determine the number of 9-person groups that can be formed from 90 people. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of people by the size of each group:

\[

\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups each brought back 2 seashells. According to the problem, \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the groups brought back seashells. Therefore, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of groups bringing seashells} = \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6
\]

Each of these 6 groups brought back 2 seashells. To find the total number of seashells brought back, we multiply the number of groups by the number of seashells each group brought:

\[
\text{Total seashells} = 6 \times 2 = 12
\]

Thus, the total number of seashells brought back is:

\[
\boxed{12}

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's calculate Jamie's regular pay for the 8 hours she works each day at her regular hourly rate of $20 per hour.

\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$160 \]

Since Jamie worked 11 hours on Tuesday, she worked 3 additional hours beyond her regular 8-hour workday. The special hourly rate for these additional hours is 150% of her regular hourly rate.

To find the special hourly rate:

\[ 150\% \text{ of } \$20 = 1.5 \times \$20 = \$30/\text{hour} \]

Now, let's calculate the pay for the 3 additional hours:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$90 \]

Finally, we add the regular pay and the additional pay to find the total amount Jamie was paid for her work on Tuesday:

"To determine the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the number of trees planted by the teachers, then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students:
- Each class has 25 students.
- There are 40 classes.
- Therefore, the total number of students is \( 25 \times 40 = 1000 \).
- Each student plants 1 tree.
- So, the total number of trees planted by the students is \( 1000 \times 1 = 1000 \).

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- Each class has 3 teachers.
- There are 40 classes.
- Therefore, the total number of teachers is \( 3 \times 40 = 120 \).
- Each teacher plants 2 trees.
- So, the total number of trees planted by the teachers is \( 120 \times 2 = 240 \).

Finally, we sum the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers:

"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total current stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the first 2 weeks. Since she plays for half an hour every day, and there are 14 days in 2 weeks, we can calculate the total hours as follows:

\[ \text{Hours per day} \times \text{Number of days} = 0.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 7 \, \text{hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the following week. Since she plays for 2 hours every day, and there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total hours as follows:

\[ \text{Hours per day} \times \text{Number of days} = 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 14 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, let's add the hours from both periods to find the total hours Kris has played so far:

\[ 7 \, \text{hours} + 14 \, \text{hours} = 21 \, \text{hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. To find out how many more hours she needs to play, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total required hours:

30% of $900 = 0.30 * $900 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of materials to find the final amount James paid:

Total cost with premium = $900 + $270 = $1170

Therefore, James paid $1170."
"To find the overall pass rate for Herbert Hoover Elementary School, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students who took the test, then divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students.

1. **Third Graders:**
   - Number of third-graders who passed: 340
   - Total number of third-graders: 500

2. **Fourth Graders:**
   - Number of fourth-graders who passed: 40
   - Total number of fourth-graders: 100

3. **Fifth Graders:**
   - Pass rate for fifth graders is twice the fourth graders' pass rate.
   - Fourth graders' pass rate: \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.4 \) or 40%
   - Fifth graders' pass rate: \( 2 \times 0.4 = 0.8 \) or 80%
   - Number of fifth-graders who passed: \( 0.8 \times 400 = 320 \)
   - Total number of fifth-graders: 400

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total number of students who passed: \( 340 + 40 + 320 = 680 \)
- Total number of students: \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \)

The overall pass rate is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{\text{Total number of students who passed}}{\text{Total number of students}} = \frac{680}{1000} = 0.68 \]

Expressing this as a percentage:

\[ 0.68 \times 100 = 68\% \]

Therefore, the school's overall pass rate is 68%."
"First, let's determine the total number of glass chips Milo has. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:

\[ \frac{144}{12} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. Let's denote the length of the mosaic as \( L \) inches. The area of the mosaic, which is the product of its height and length, is:
\[ 3 \times L = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the length of the mosaic Milo can make is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

- Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea. So, the total amount of tea consumed by these students is \(4 \times 1.5 = 6\) quarts.
- Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea. So, the total amount of tea consumed by these students is \(16 \times 2 = 32\) quarts.

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed by all the students:
\[6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts}\]

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is the sum of the tea consumed and the tea left:
\[38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts}\]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts. Therefore, the total amount of tea in gallons is:
\[48 \div 4 = 12 \text{ gallons}\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picked:

1. **3 flowers with 5 petals each:**
   \[
   3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals}
   \]

2. **4 flowers with 6 petals each:**
   \[
   4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals}
   \]

3. **5 flowers with 4 petals each:**
   \[
   5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals}
   \]

4. **6 flowers with 7 petals each:**
   \[
   6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals}
   \]

Next, we sum these totals to find the initial number of petals:
\[
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals}
\]

Rose then drops 1 of each type of flower she picked. This means she drops:

"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used and dropped:

- John makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.
- DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.
- They dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.

The total number of marshmallows used and dropped is:
\[ 9 + 9 + 3 = 21 \]

The original number of marshmallows in the bag was 35. After using and dropping some, the number of marshmallows left is:
\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \]

Since John and DeSean are sharing the remaining marshmallows equally, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2:
\[ 14 \div 2 = 7 \]

So, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

Final answer:
Each kid can have 7 S'mores."
"First, let's break down the time each person can play with one quarter:

1. Jack can play for 20 minutes.
2. Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes.
3. The other friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes.

Next, we need to calculate how many quarters each person uses in 4 hours (240 minutes):

1. Jack: \(\frac{240}{20} = 12\) quarters.
2. Each of the two friends who can play for 10 minutes: \(\frac{240}{10} = 24\) quarters each.
3. The friend who can play for 30 minutes: \(\frac{240}{30} = 8\) quarters.

Now, we sum up the total number of quarters used:

\[12 + 24 + 24 + 8 = 68\]

So, the total amount of money used is 68 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total money used is:

\[68 \times 0.25 = 17\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{17}

"Let's define the variables for the quantities of each ingredient Tanya uses:
- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest (in ounces).
- Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \).
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt (in ounces).
- Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \).
- Let \( o \) be the amount of oil (in ounces).

From the problem, we know the following relationships:
1. The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt: \( o = 2s \).
2. The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest: \( s = 2z \).

We can substitute \( s = 2z \) into the equation for \( o \):
\[ o = 2s = 2(2z) = 4z. \]

The total amount of all ingredients is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ o + z + z + s + s = 10. \]
Substituting \( o = 4z \) and \( s = 2z \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 4z + z + z + 2z + 2z = 10. \]
Combining like terms, we have:
\[ 10z = 10. \]
Solving for \( z \), we get:
\[ z = 1. \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil:

"To find out how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the overall amount spent:
- Total cost of goats: $1500
- Total cost of cows: $3000
- Therefore, the total amount spent is \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:

63 - 48 = 15

Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"First, let's determine how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to calculate how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving some away. Initially, Joe had 40 cars. After selling 8 cars and giving away 16 cars, the number of cars he remains with is:

\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final number of cars Joe remains with is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much money came from the students. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, and they collectively raised $125,000. So, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

Thus, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\)."
"On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day, which is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) hours.

The total time Sandy walked over the two days is \( 8 + 4 = 12 \) hours.

To convert this total time into minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\( 12 \times 60 = 720 \) minutes.

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"To determine the total number of cars Hunter counted during lunch break, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Count**: Hunter initially counted 50 cars.
2. **Additional Cars During First Break**: During the first break, 20 more cars entered the parking lot. So, the total number of cars after the first break is:
   \[
   50 + 20 = 70
   \]
3. **Cars Leaving During Lunch Break**: During the lunch break, half of the cars left the parking lot. Therefore, the number of cars that left is:
   \[
   \frac{70}{2} = 35
   \]
4. **Remaining Cars During Lunch Break**: The number of cars remaining in the parking lot during the lunch break is:
   \[
   70 - 35 = 35
   \]

Thus, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is \(\boxed{35}\)."
"To calculate how much John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tasks John does in a day.
2. Calculate the total number of tasks John does in a week.
3. Calculate the total earnings based on the number of tasks and the pay per task.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of tasks per day.
John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 tasks.
\[ 30 \text{ cycles/day} \times 5 \text{ tasks/cycle} = 150 \text{ tasks/day} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total number of tasks per week.
John works 7 days a week.
\[ 150 \text{ tasks/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1050 \text{ tasks/week} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total earnings.
Each task pays $1.20.
\[ 1050 \text{ tasks/week} \times \$1.20/\text{task} = \$1260 \]

Therefore, John makes \(\$1260\) in a full 7-day week."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.
2. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game. Therefore, Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points in the first game.
3. In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.

Now, we need to find the total points Sasha scored during both games:

- Points scored by Sasha in the first game: 14 points
- Points scored by Sasha in the second game: 4 points

Total points scored by Sasha = \(14 + 4 = 18\)

Therefore, the total points Sasha scored during both games is 18."

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the term with \( P \):
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( P \):
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards. Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, the number of cards Becca has is:

"To determine the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each type of egg and then sum them up.

1. **Green Eggs**: Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. **Blue Eggs**: Cindy had twice as many blue eggs as green ones. Therefore, the number of blue eggs is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
3. **Pink Eggs**: Cindy had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs. Therefore, the number of pink eggs is:
   \[
   10 - 1 = 9
   \]
4. **Yellow Eggs**: Cindy had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. Therefore, the number of yellow eggs is:
   \[
   \frac{9}{3} = 3
   \]

Now, we sum up all the eggs:
\[
5 \text{ (green)} + 10 \text{ (blue)} + 9 \text{ (pink)} + 3 \text{ (yellow)} = 27
\]

Therefore, Cindy had a total of 27 eggs."
"First, let's calculate the refund Milly will receive from Amazon. The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of this amount.

\[ \text{Refund} = 32 \times 0.75 = 24 \]

Next, we need to calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound and $0.08 per mile. The book weighs 4 pounds and needs to be returned 20 miles.

\[ \text{Cost per pound} = 4 \times 0.35 = 1.40 \]
\[ \text{Cost per mile} = 20 \times 0.08 = 1.60 \]
\[ \text{Total shipping cost} = 1.40 + 1.60 = 3.00 \]

Now, we can determine how much money Milly will lose by subtracting the refund from the total cost of the book and the shipping cost.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 32 + 3.00 = 35.00 \]
\[ \text{Money lost} = 35.00 - 24.00 = 11.00 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Milly will lose is:

\[ \boxed{11} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for four turtles to travel the same distance as the kangaroos, given their different speeds.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - Let the distance across the highway be \( D \).
   - Let the speed of each kangaroo be \( S \).
   - The total time taken by the three kangaroos is 18 hours.
   - Since they are traveling at the same speed, the time taken by one kangaroo to travel the distance \( D \) is \( \frac{D}{S} \).
   - For three kangaroos, the total time is \( 3 \times \frac{D}{S} = 18 \) hours.
   - Simplifying, we get \( \frac{D}{S} = 6 \) hours. This means it takes one kangaroo 6 hours to travel the distance \( D \).

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{S}{2} \).

3. **Calculate the time for the turtles:**
   - The time taken by one turtle to travel the distance \( D \) is \( \frac{D}{\frac{S}{2}} = \frac{2D}{S} \).
   - Since \( \frac{D}{S} = 6 \) hours, the time for one turtle is \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \) hours.
   - For four turtles, the total time is \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) hours.

Therefore, it will take four turtles 48 hours to travel across the highway."

   t = 3 \text{ years}
   \]

4. **Calculate the simple interest (I):**
   The formula for simple interest is:
   \[
   I = P \times r \times t
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   I = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3 = 300 \times 2.25 = 675
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount (A):**
   The total amount after 3 years is the sum of the principal and the interest:
   \[
   A = P + I = 300 + 675 = 975

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total White Shirts and Collars:**
   - The store has 40 white shirts.
   - Half of the white shirts have collars.
   - Therefore, the number of white shirts with collars is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).

2. **Total White Shirts and No Collars:**
   - Since there are 40 white shirts in total and 20 have collars, the number of white shirts with no collars is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

3. **Total Floral Shirts and Buttons:**
   - The store has 50 floral shirts.
   - 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.

4. **Total Floral Shirts and No Buttons:**
   - Since there are 50 floral shirts in total and 20 have buttons, the number of floral shirts with no buttons is \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

5. **Difference Between Floral Shirts with No Buttons and White Shirts with No Collars:**
   - The number of floral shirts with no buttons is 30.
   - The number of white shirts with no collars is 20.
   - The difference is \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

Therefore, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars."
"First, we need to determine how many trays the farmer will need to hold all 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ 30 \text{ trays} \times \$2.5 \text{ per tray} = \$75 \]

Therefore, the farmer will earn \(\$75\)."
"First, let's determine how many goats Mr. Smith sold from each farm.

From Farm X, he sold 10 goats. So, the number of goats left in Farm X is:
\[ 55 - 10 = 45 \]

From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as he did from Farm X. Since he sold 10 goats from Farm X, he sold:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]
goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \]

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms to find the total number of goats left:
\[ 45 + 25 = 70 \]

Therefore, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total annual spending by the total number of pairs of shoes.

First, since James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month, we calculate the total number of pairs he buys in a year:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

Next, we divide the total annual spending by the total number of pairs of shoes:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

Therefore, James pays on average $110 for each pair of shoes."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food:**
   - Each basket of green food costs $25.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 3 baskets of green food is \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount:**
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - You get $2 off for each basket of red food.
   - Therefore, the cost per basket of red food after the discount is \( 18 - 2 = 16 \) dollars.
   - The total cost for 3 baskets of red food is \( 3 \times 16 = 48 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the cost of the green food and the red food.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \( 75 + 48 = 123 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
123"
"First, calculate the number of rooms that constitute one-half of the total rooms at KozyInn Motel:

\[
\frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms}
\]

Next, determine the total time required to clean these 45 rooms. Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, the total time in minutes is:

\[
45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes}
\]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[
\frac{900}{60} = 15 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms."
"In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.

By the end of the second year, the total number of homes built is \(12 + 36 = 48\) homes.

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built by the end of the second year, which is \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Therefore, the total number of homes built over the next three years is \(12 + 36 + 96 = 144\) homes.

"Let's define the variables for the ages of the individuals mentioned in the problem:

- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( M \) be the age of the mother.
- Let \( A \) be the age of the person asking the question (you).

From the problem, we can establish the following relationships:

1. You are three years younger than your brother:
   \[
   A = B - 3
   \]

2. You are two years older than your sister:
   \[
   S = A - 2
   \]

3. Your mother's age is one less than three times your brother's age:
   \[
   M = 3B - 1
   \]

4. The sum of all their ages is 87:
   \[
   A + B + S + M = 87
   \]

Now, substitute the expressions for \( A \), \( S \), and \( M \) into the sum equation:

\[
(B - 3) + B + (B - 3 - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
6B - 9 = 87
\]

Add 9 to both sides:

\[
6B = 96
\]

Divide by 6:

\[
B = 16
\]

Now, substitute \( B = 16 \) back into the equation for \( A \):

\[
A = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13
\]

So, you are 13 years old.

\[
\boxed{13}

"First, we need to determine the total number of glue sticks required for the class. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we calculate:

\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks/student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy. Each pack contains 8 glue sticks. To find the number of packs required, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ \frac{54 \text{ glue sticks}}{8 \text{ glue sticks/pack}} = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks to ensure he has enough for all the students and some extra glue sticks left over.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles, so the new amount is:
\[ 4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons} \]

On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day is:
\[ 8000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 14000 \text{ gallons} \]

Thus, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is:
\[ 14000 \text{ gallons} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and then sum them up.

**Day 0:**
- Initially, 10 people are infected.

**Day 1:**
- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections on Day 1: \(10 \times 6 = 60\)
- Total infected after Day 1: \(10 + 60 = 70\)

**Day 2:**
- Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections on Day 2: \(70 \times 6 = 420\)
- Total infected after Day 2: \(70 + 420 = 490\)

**Day 3:**
- Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections on Day 3: \(490 \times 6 = 2940\)
- Total infected after Day 3: \(490 + 2940 = 3430\)

Therefore, the total number of people infected after three days is **3430**."
"First, let's calculate how much money Rafaela received in tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total amount as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ customers} \times \$20 \text{ per customer} = \$800 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips, we calculate:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$800 = 0.10 \times \$800 = \$80 \]

Since Julieta received 10% less, we subtract this amount from Rafaela's total tips:

\[ \$800 - \$80 = \$720 \]

Now, to find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their individual totals together:

\[ \$800 + \$720 = \$1520 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money that Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is:

\[ \$1520 \]"

"First, let's determine how many badges each person earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge every month. In a year (12 months), Claire will earn:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so she earns 1 badge every 2 months. In a year, Amber will earn:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. In a year, Wendy will earn:
\[ 3 \times 12 \text{ badges} = 36 \text{ badges} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year:
\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame."
"First, let's determine how many hours Paige spent baking. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours.

Next, we calculate how many banana bread loaves she baked in those 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, in 5 hours she baked:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices from 10 loaves is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. Therefore, the total amount raised from selling all the slices is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount raised is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"

Gretchen had a total of 110 coins."
"First, let's calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students. There are 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. Therefore, the total number of burritos consumed by the students is:

\[ 50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos/student} = 500 \text{ burritos} \]

Next, we need to account for the burritos that Mr. George ate. Mr. George ate 20 burritos. So, the total number of burritos consumed is:

\[ 500 \text{ burritos} + 20 \text{ burritos} = 520 \text{ burritos} \]

George ordered 600 burritos in total. To find the number of leftover burritos, we subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the total number of burritos ordered:

\[ 600 \text{ burritos} - 520 \text{ burritos} = 80 \text{ burritos} \]

Therefore, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The rink has 12 red cars.
2. The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars. So, the number of green cars = 12 - 2 = 10.
3. The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars. So, the number of blue cars = 3 * 10 = 30.
4. The total number of cars in the rink is 75.

To find the number of yellow cars, we need to subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars.

Total number of cars = Number of red cars + Number of green cars + Number of blue cars + Number of yellow cars

75 = 12 + 10 + 30 + Number of yellow cars

Now, let's calculate the number of yellow cars:

Number of yellow cars = 75 - (12 + 10 + 30) = 75 - 52 = 23

So, the number of yellow cars is 23."
"Let's define the number of books each person has using variables:
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (Together, they have 85 books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, we can substitute the expression for \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation to express \( S \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \]

Now we substitute \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \(\boxed{28}\) books."

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \text{ pounds} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of jello cups Greg needs. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid will have 4 jello cups, the total number of jello cups required is:

\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups per kid} = 120 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many three-ounce boxes of jello are required to make 120 cups. Since one three-ounce box makes 10 small jello cups, the number of boxes needed is:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost. Since each box is on sale for $1.25, the total cost for 12 boxes is:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

Therefore, Greg will spend \(\boxed{15}\) dollars on jello."
"First, calculate the total cost of the 5 phones:

"First, let's calculate the total amount Madeline pays per month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the $400 monthly cost, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Madeline's monthly payment} = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

This means Keenan pays the remaining 40% of the $400 monthly cost. We can calculate Keenan's monthly payment as follows:

\[ \text{Keenan's monthly payment} = 0.40 \times 400 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the question asks for the amount Keenan spends per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide Keenan's monthly payment by 4:

\[ \text{Keenan's weekly payment} = \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week."
"First, let's calculate how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 pieces:

So, on the first day, he ate 24 pieces. This leaves:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces, so the remaining pieces are:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

On the third day, he ate \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining 26 pieces:

\[ \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14 \]

So, on the third day, he ate 14 pieces. Now, let's sum up all the pieces he has eaten:

\[ 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 \]

Therefore, Tobias has eaten a total of 48 pieces of pizza so far."
"First, let's determine the cost per bottle for soda and water.

1. **Cost per bottle of soda:**

"First, let's determine how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. He has 300 chickens and plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of them.

\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = 300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180 \]

Next, we know that Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000 by selling these chickens at $50 each. The total revenue from selling 180 chickens at $50 each is:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

This total revenue of $9000 includes the cost of buying the chickens and the $2000 profit. Therefore, the total cost of buying the chickens is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Profit} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

Since Isaias bought 180 chickens, the cost per chicken is:

\[ \text{Cost per chicken} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of chickens}} = \frac{7000}{180} \approx 38.89 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for is:

"First, let's determine how many glasses of lemonade Micah and Mitchell sold in total. Since Julie sold 14 glasses and the total sales were 32 glasses, we can calculate the remaining glasses sold by the boys as follows:

\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses equally between the two:

\[ 18 \div 2 = 9 \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses of lemonade. Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah:

\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

"First, let's determine how much Iris spent on the manicure. Since she spent 1/4 as much on the manicure as she did on her hair, we calculate:

\[ \text{Manicure cost} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the pedicure. She spent 3/4 as much on the pedicure as she did on the manicure, so:

\[ \text{Pedicure cost} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent at the spa:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Hair cost} + \text{Manicure cost} + \text{Pedicure cost} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is:

"First, let's calculate how much money Sarah will earn from selling the rope.

The rope is 20 meters long, and she sells it for $2 per meter. Therefore, the total amount of money she will earn is:
\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40 \]

Next, let's determine the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and we need to know how many meters of the new rope Sarah plans to buy. Since the problem does not specify the length of the new rope, we will assume she buys the same length as the original rope, which is 20 meters. Therefore, the cost of the new rope is:
\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$30 \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the money Sarah earned to find out how much money she will have left over:
\[ \$40 - \$30 = \$10 \]

So, the amount of money Sarah will have left over after she buys the new rope is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age.

1. If Melanie will be 18 years old in 10 years, her current age is \(18 - 10 = 8\) years old.

2. We need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Three times her current age is \(3 \times 8 = 24\) years.

3. To find out how many years it will take for her to be 24 years old, we subtract her current age from 24:

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item category:

1. **Bacon:**
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon.
   - Total cost for bacon = $10.

2. **Chicken:**
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Cost of one packet of chicken = 2 * $2 = $4.
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   - Total cost for chicken = 6 * $4 = $24.

3. **Strawberries:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries.
   - Total cost for strawberries = 3 * $4 = $12.

4. **Apples:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Cost of one pack of apples = $4 / 2 = $2.
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples.
   - Total cost for apples = 7 * $2 = $14.

Next, we sum up the total cost of all items:
- Total cost = Cost of bacon + Cost of chicken + Cost of strawberries + Cost of apples
- Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left in her budget, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
- Money left = Budget - Total cost
- Money left = $65 - $60 = $5.

Therefore, Kelly has $5 left in her budget."
"Let's denote the usual length of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes.

According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, plus a 15-minute encore. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert can be expressed as:
\[ 2x + 15 \]

We are given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. So, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

Therefore, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes.

Final answer:
25"
"To determine how many toys Argo has after giving some away, we need to start with the initial number of toys and subtract the number of toys given to each person.

1. Argo starts with 200 toys.
2. He gives 40 toys to Alyssa: \(200 - 40 = 160\).
3. He gives 80 toys to Bonnie: \(160 - 80 = 80\).
4. He gives 30 toys to Nicky: \(80 - 30 = 50\).

So, after giving away all the toys, Argo has \(\boxed{50}\) toys left."
"To find the total number of chimichangas made on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on each of these days.

1. On Tuesdays, they make 125 chimichangas.
2. On Wednesdays, they also make 125 chimichangas.
3. On Fridays, they make twice as many as on a Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

Now, we add these numbers together:

\[ 125 + 125 + 250 = 500 \]

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"First, we need to determine how many microphones will not find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. Given that 20% of the 50 microphones won't fit, we calculate 20% of 50:

\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

This means 10 microphones will not be paired. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be paired is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the number of pairs of microphones that the singer was able to arrange on the stage is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.
2. He also counts \(\frac{2}{3}\) of that number of birds flying overhead. So, we need to calculate \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6\):
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4
   \]
   Therefore, 4 birds are flying overhead.
3. Jerry also counts 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, we need to calculate \(3 \times 8\):
   \[
   3 \times 8 = 24
   \]
   Therefore, 24 birds are feeding.

Now, we add up all the birds Jerry counts:
\[
6 \text{ (nesting)} + 4 \text{ (flying overhead)} + 24 \text{ (feeding)} = 34
\]

So, the total number of birds Jerry counts is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"Lani initially baked 55 cookies. She ate 5 cookies, leaving her with \(55 - 5 = 50\) cookies. She then placed these 50 cookies equally into 5 jars. Therefore, the number of cookies in each jar is \(50 \div 5 = 10\).

So, the number of cookies in each jar is 10."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals on the orchids is:

\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals on the daisies is:

\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies:

\[ 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids."
"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of the remaining 75 plants are outdoor plants. So, we calculate the number of outdoor plants as follows:

\[ \text{Outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. To find the number of flowering plants, we subtract the number of indoor and outdoor plants from the total number of plants:

\[ \text{Flowering plants} = 100 - 25 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants is:

\[ \boxed{25\%} \]"
"To determine the speed of the whirligig, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the speed of the thingamabob.
2. Use the speed of the thingamabob to find the speed of the whirligig.

First, we know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, we can find the speed of the thingamabob by dividing the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11:

\[
\text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second}
\]

Next, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, we can find the speed of the whirligig by multiplying the speed of the thingamabob by 5:

\[
\text{Speed of whirligig} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \times 5 = 55 \text{ meters per second}
\]

Thus, the speed of the whirligig is \(\boxed{55}\) meters per second."
"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot every day, we need to break down the total cost of her daily diet and then isolate the cost of the carrots.

1. **Cost of the salad**: $6
2. **Cost of the yogurt**: Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, it costs $6 / 2 = $3.
3. **Total cost of the salad and yogurt**: $6 + $3 = $9
4. **Total daily cost**: $11
5. **Cost of the carrots**: Since the total cost is $11 and the cost of the salad and yogurt is $9, the cost of the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.
6. **Cost of one carrot**: Ellen eats two carrots, so the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

Therefore, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day."
"First, let's calculate Mark's new hourly wage after the raise. He used to make $10 an hour and received a raise of $2 per hour. Therefore, his new hourly wage is:

\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week. Therefore, the total number of hours he works in a week is:

\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week:

\[ 12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns and then subtract that amount from her total earnings to find out how much she made from lemonade sales.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
- Then, the number of times Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn is \( 3J \).
- The number of times Tasha mowed Alba's lawn is \( 5J \).

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and we know that Tasha was paid $6 for each mowing job, we can set up the following equation to find out how much she was paid for mowing Joe's lawn:
\[ 6J = 6 \]
From this, we can solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

Now, we can find out how many times Tasha mowed Kamala's and Alba's lawns:
- Kamala's lawn: \( 3J = 3 \times 1 = 3 \) times
- Alba's lawn: \( 5J = 5 \times 1 = 5 \) times

Next, we calculate the total amount Tasha earned from mowing lawns:
\[ 6J + 6 \times 3 + 6 \times 5 = 6 \times 1 + 6 \times 3 + 6 \times 5 = 6 + 18 + 30 = 54 \]

Tasha's total earnings last month were $80. Therefore, the amount she made from lemonade sales is:
\[ 80 - 54 = 26 \]

So, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's determine Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, and Martin's weight is 55 kg, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we calculate Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so:

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we determine Harry's weight. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so:

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate how much John earns from renting out his car each month.

1. John rents his car out 10 times a month.
2. Each rental session lasts 3 hours.
3. He gets paid $25 per hour.

To find out how much he earns per rental session, we multiply the number of hours by the hourly rate:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/session} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$75/\text{session} \]

Next, we calculate his total earnings for the month:
\[ 10 \text{ sessions/month} \times \$75/\text{session} = \$750/\text{month} \]

Now, we need to subtract his car payment from his total earnings to find his profit:
\[ \$750 - \$500 = \$250 \]

Therefore, John's profit from renting out his car each month is:
\[ \$250 \]"
"First, let's determine how many notebooks Martha originally had. Since Martha ended up with 7 notebooks after buying 5 more, we can calculate the number of notebooks she originally had as follows:

\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks. According to the problem, Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. Therefore, Joseph had:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has compared to Joseph after her purchase. Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph still has 6 notebooks. The difference is:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph. The final answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the distance Anis rowed. Anis rowed \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more miles than Dijana. Since Dijana rowed 50 miles, we calculate Anis's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Anis's distance} = 50 + \left( \frac{1}{5} \times 50 \right) \]
\[ \text{Anis's distance} = 50 + 10 \]
\[ \text{Anis's distance} = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance rowed by both of them:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Dijana's distance} + \text{Anis's distance} \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = 50 + 60 \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = 110 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is 110 miles."
"First, we need to account for the 4 cookies that Susan's husband took. Initially, Susan made 100 cookies. After her husband took 4 cookies, the number of cookies left is:

\[ 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Next, we need to divide these 96 cookies equally among her 6 nephews. To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we divide 96 by 6:

\[ 96 \div 6 = 16 \]

So, each of Susan’s nephews will get \(\boxed{16}\) cookies."
"First, let's determine how many pages each person read today.

Denise read 5 more than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read:
\[ 13 + 5 = 18 \text{ pages today} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of pages each person has read over the two days.

Denise read 10 pages yesterday and 18 pages today, so the total number of pages Denise read is:
\[ 10 + 18 = 28 \text{ pages} \]

Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and 0 pages today, so the total number of pages Daniel read is:
\[ 13 + 0 = 13 \text{ pages} \]

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total number of pages Daniel read from the total number of pages Denise read:
\[ 28 - 13 = 15 \]

Therefore, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel."
"First, let's determine the total amount of soup Calvin has. The pot can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. Since Calvin is an adult, we can use the adult's bowl measurement as the standard. Therefore, the total amount of soup is equivalent to 4 adult bowls.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of bowls of soup that will be consumed by Calvin, his wife, and their two children for the meal. Since both Calvin and his wife are adults, and they each will have one bowl, that accounts for 2 bowls. The two children will also each have one bowl, adding another 2 bowls. Therefore, the total number of bowls consumed at the meal is:

\[ 2 \text{ (adults)} + 2 \text{ (children)} = 4 \text{ bowls} \]

Since the pot contains the equivalent of 4 adult bowls, and 4 bowls will be consumed at the meal, there will be no soup left over for lunch. Therefore, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup:

\[ 0 \text{ times} \]

Final answer:

"To find out how much William spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen he bought.

1. The cost of one notebook is $1.50. Since William bought five notebooks, the total cost for the notebooks is:
   \[
   5 \times 1.50 = 7.50
   \]

2. The cost of one ballpen is $0.50. Since William bought one ballpen, the total cost for the ballpen is:
   \[
   1 \times 0.50 = 0.50
   \]

3. Adding the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen together gives:
   \[
   7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00
   \]

Therefore, William spent a total of $8.00."
"To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, we calculate the amount of material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the amount of material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards} \).
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \times 0.5 \text{ yards} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

Next, we calculate the amount of material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the amount of material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards} \).
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \times 0.75 \text{ yards} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Finally, we add the material needed for the small and large masks together:
- Total material needed = \( 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards} \).

Therefore, Jo would need \(\boxed{16}\) yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of times Deepa saw the movies.
2. Divide the total amount of money spent by the total number of tickets purchased.

First, we calculate the total number of times Deepa saw the movies. Since there are 9 movies and she saw each one 3 times, the total number of times she saw the movies is:
\[ 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ times} \]

Next, we know that she spent $216 in total. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount of money spent by the total number of tickets purchased:
\[ \frac{216 \text{ dollars}}{27 \text{ tickets}} = 8 \text{ dollars per ticket} \]

Therefore, the average price she paid per ticket is:

"To determine Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total hours he spends on activities and subtract that from the total hours in a day.

1. **Sleeping**: Harold sleeps for 10 hours.
2. **Working**: He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. **Walking the dog**: He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up the total hours spent on these activities:
\[ 10 \text{ (sleeping)} + 8 \text{ (working)} + 1 \text{ (walking the dog)} = 19 \text{ hours} \]

There are 24 hours in a day. To find the free time, we subtract the total hours spent on activities from the total hours in a day:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \]

Therefore, Harold has \(\boxed{5}\) hours of free time left in his day."

"To solve this problem, let's first set up the equations based on the information given.

1. Let \( D \) be Duncan's current age, and \( A \) be Adam's current age.
2. According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was \( D - 8 \).
3. Adam's age four years ago was \( A - 4 \).
4. The problem states that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   D - 8 = 2(A - 4)
   \]
5. We are also given that Duncan's current age \( D \) is 60. So, we substitute \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
   \[
   60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
   \]
6. Simplify the left side:
   \[
   52 = 2(A - 4)
   \]
7. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   26 = A - 4
   \]
8. Add 4 to both sides to solve for \( A \):
   \[
   A = 30
   \]
9. Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years."
"First, let's determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm. According to the problem, Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Adding 100 acres to this amount gives the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, to find the total number of acres for both farms combined, we add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

Therefore, the total number of acres for both farms together is:
\[ 700 \text{ acres} \]"
"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. This can be calculated as:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ packages per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. This is calculated by multiplying the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours he works in a day:

\[ 40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Now, we need to calculate how much money he earns for completing these 320 packages. Since he earns $0.20 for every package, we multiply the number of packages by the payment per package:

\[ 320 \text{ packages} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/package} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of yellow balloons Benny threw bologna at. Let's break down the information given:

1. Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
2. Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
3. Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
4. There were 20 red balloons.

First, calculate the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons:
\[ 20 \text{ red balloons} \times 2 \text{ pieces of bologna per red balloon} = 40 \text{ pieces of bologna} \]

Next, subtract the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons from the total number of pieces of bologna to find out how many pieces were thrown at the yellow balloons:
\[ 58 \text{ total pieces of bologna} - 40 \text{ pieces of bologna for red balloons} = 18 \text{ pieces of bologna for yellow balloons} \]

Now, determine the number of yellow balloons by dividing the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons by the number of pieces thrown at each yellow balloon:
\[ \frac{18 \text{ pieces of bologna}}{3 \text{ pieces of bologna per yellow balloon}} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

Therefore, the number of yellow balloons is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: Since 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, we can calculate the cost as follows:
   - Cost for 2 balloons = $0.5
   - Cost for 1 balloon = $0.5 / 2 = $0.25
   - Cost for 12 balloons = $0.25 * 12 = $3
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each = $7 * 2 = $14

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
- Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
- Total cost = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to cover these expenses, the total amount they had together is $28. Since they had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total by 2 to find out how much each girl received:
- Allowance per girl = $28 / 2 = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14."
"Kira initially bought a total of 3 apples + 5 bananas + 6 oranges = 14 pieces of fruit.

"First, let's determine the number of students playing tennis and volleyball. There are 6 students playing tennis. Since there are twice as many students playing volleyball, we calculate the number of volleyball players as follows:

\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Next, we add the number of students playing tennis and volleyball to find the total number of students in these two activities:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

Now, we consider the students playing soccer. There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so the total number of students playing soccer is:

\[ 16 + 22 = 38 \]

Since each student only participates in one group, we add the number of students playing tennis and volleyball to the number of students playing soccer to find the total number of students:

\[ 18 + 38 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total number of students is:

\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"To determine how much money the class was able to raise from the profit of selling lollipops, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of lollipops sold:**
   - Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops.
   - Total lollipops sold = \( 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \).

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops:**
   - Each lollypop was sold for $0.8.
   - Total revenue = \( 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \).

3. **Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops:**
   - Each lollypop was bought for $0.5.
   - Total cost = \( 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \).

4. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost.
   - Profit = \( \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \).

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Let's break down the information step by step to find out how many pets Larry has in total.

1. **Cats**: Larry has 3 cats.
2. **Dogs**: Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats. So, the number of dogs is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).
3. **Rabbits**: Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. So, the number of rabbits is \(9 - 2 = 7\).
4. **Fish**: Larry has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. So, the number of fish is \(3 \times 7 = 21\).
5. **Gerbils**: Larry has a collection of gerbils that is \(\frac{1}{3}\) the number of fish he has. So, the number of gerbils is \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\).

Now, let's add up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

The total number of pets is \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\).

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{47}

"First, let's determine how many slices Josh can eat in a day. Since Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, and Abby eats 2 slices a day, Josh eats \(2 \times 2 = 4\) slices a day.

Next, we calculate the total number of slices both Abby and Josh can eat in one day. Together, they eat \(2 + 4 = 6\) slices a day.

Now, we need to find out how many days the loaf of bread will last. The loaf has 24 slices, and they eat 6 slices per day. Therefore, the number of days the loaf will last is \(24 \div 6 = 4\).

So, the loaf of bread will last \(\boxed{4}\) days."
"To determine how many shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months from when she turned 5 years old to her 10th birthday.

1. Martha started collecting shells at age 5.
2. She will have been collecting shells for 10 - 5 = 5 years.
3. Since she collects one shell every month, we need to find out how many months are in 5 years.

There are 12 months in a year, so in 5 years, there are:
5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

Therefore, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected 60 shells.

60"
"First, we need to determine how many cups are in each row. Since Lana has 27 cups and divides them into 3 rows, we can calculate the number of cups per row as follows:

\[ \text{Cups per row} = \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3 \text{ rows}} = 9 \text{ cups per row} \]

Next, we know that in each row, the cups are divided equally between chamomile and mint tea. Therefore, in each row, there are 4.5 cups of chamomile tea and 4.5 cups of mint tea. However, since we cannot have half a cup in a practical scenario, we assume the problem is framed in a way that allows for fractional cups, or it might imply a theoretical division.

To find the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we take half of the 9 cups in each row:

\[ \text{Cups of mint tea per row} = \frac{9 \text{ cups}}{2} = 4.5 \text{ cups} \]

Thus, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:

\[ \boxed{4.5} \]"
"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours:**
   - Each trip takes 4 hours.
   - In 8 hours, the sloth can make \( \frac{8}{4} = 2 \) trips.

2. **Determine the total number of berries needed per trip:**
   - The sloth needs to collect 24 berries in total.
   - If the sloth makes 2 trips, the number of berries per trip is \( \frac{24}{2} = 12 \).

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground is 12.

**Final Answer:**
12"
"First, determine the amount of water in the tank after Anthony and his father fill it. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons, the tank will have:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, calculate the amount of water used from the tank over 6 days. If the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, then over 6 days, the total amount of water used is:

\[ 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank to find the remaining amount of water:

\[ 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \boxed{2000} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Colby has spent so far this month.

1. **Movies on Fridays and Saturdays:**
   - He saw 5 movies on Fridays and Saturdays.
   - Each ticket costs $10.
   - Total spent on these movies: \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars.

2. **Movies on other days:**
   - He saw 8 movies on other days.
   - Each ticket costs $7.
   - Total spent on these movies: \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars.

3. **Popcorn:**
   - He had 2 tubs of popcorn.
   - Each tub costs $8.
   - Total spent on popcorn: \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.

4. **Candy:**
   - He had 4 boxes of candy.
   - Each box costs $2.
   - Total spent on candy: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.

Now, let's sum up all the expenses:
\[50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = 130\] dollars.

Colby's parents give him $150 each month, so the remaining amount is:
\[150 - 130 = 20\] dollars.

On the last day of the month, it is a Friday, and he wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy. The cost for these items is:
\[8 + 2 = 10\] dollars.

After buying the popcorn and candy, the remaining amount is:
\[20 - 10 = 10\] dollars.

Since each movie ticket on a Friday or Saturday costs $10, with $10 remaining, he can buy one more ticket.

Therefore, the total number of movies he can see is the sum of the movies he has already seen and the one he can see now:
\[5 + 8 + 1 = 14\] movies.

**Final Answer:**
14"
"First, let's calculate the calorie content for the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins.

1. **Mini Cinnamon Rolls:**
   - A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
   - A mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
   - Therefore, each mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \) calories.
   - Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls.
   - Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls: \( 200 \times 200 = 40,000 \) calories.

2. **Mini Blueberry Muffins:**
   - A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
   - A mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
   - Therefore, each mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{450}{3} = 150 \) calories.
   - Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins.
   - Total calories from mini blueberry muffins: \( 300 \times 150 = 45,000 \) calories.

3. **Total Calories:**
   - Total calories from all the pastries: \( 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 \) calories.

The total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is **85,000** calories."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the week and then divide by the number of days.

1. **Monday**: 39 Junebugs
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
3. **Wednesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
4. **Thursday**: 48 Junebugs
5. **Friday**: 57 Junebugs

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed each day:
\[ 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 \]

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 39 + 78 = 117 \]
\[ 117 + 78 = 195 \]
\[ 195 + 48 = 243 \]
\[ 243 + 57 = 300 \]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{300}{5} = 60 \]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To determine how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car, we first need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The distance traveled by the bus can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

For the car:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the bus and the car:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of all the other toys and then subtract that total from the overall number of toys Sophie has.

1. The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
2. The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
3. The tower of stacking rings has 9 rings.
4. The total number of toys is 62.

First, we add the number of each type of toy:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Next, we subtract the total number of these toys from the overall number of toys to find out how many bouncy balls there are:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

So, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14."
"Let's define the variables for the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as follows:
- Let \( P \) be the age of Peter.
- Let \( p \) be the age of Paul.
- Let \( j \) be the age of Jean.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.

We can express these statements as equations:
1. \( P + p + j = 100 \)
2. \( p = j + 10 \)
3. \( P = p + j \)

First, substitute the expression for \( p \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[ P = (j + 10) + j \]
\[ P = 2j + 10 \]

Now, substitute the expressions for \( p \) and \( P \) into the first equation:
\[ (2j + 10) + (j + 10) + j = 100 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 2j + 10 + j + 10 + j = 100 \]
\[ 4j + 20 = 100 \]
Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 4j = 80 \]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[ j = 20 \]

Now that we have \( j \), we can find \( p \) and \( P \):
\[ p = j + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2j + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is \( \boxed{50} \)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Maria invited 4 friends, and she gave each of them 2 water balloons.
   - So, the total number of balloons given to her friends initially is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) balloons.

2. Maria also had 1 water balloon for herself.

3. Then, Maria's mom came out and gave each person (including Maria) 3 more balloons.
   - Since there are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons given is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) balloons.

4. Now, we need to calculate the total number of balloons:
   - Initial balloons given to friends: 8
   - Balloons Maria had: 1
   - Additional balloons given by mom: 15

   Adding these together: \(8 + 1 + 15 = 24\)

So, the total number of balloons the girls had is 24."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated and already owned by the charity group.

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so the total number of donated boxes is:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

Adding the 10 boxes they already have:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all 60 boxes, given that each table can hold 2 boxes of stuff.

The total number of tables needed is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes per table}} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

Since they already own 15 tables, the number of new tables they need is:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ tables} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney.

- Distance per seed: 10 feet
- Total distance spat by Zoey: \(40 \times 10 = 400\) feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds: 35
- Distance per seed: 12 feet
- Total distance spat by Sydney: \(35 \times 12 = 420\) feet

Next, we find the combined total distance spat by both:
- Combined total distance: \(400 + 420 = 820\) feet

Now, we calculate the average total distance spat:
- Total number of seeds: \(40 + 35 = 75\)
- Average total distance: \(\frac{820}{75} \approx 10.9333\) feet

Therefore, the average total distance spat is approximately 10.93 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of widgets produced by each machine in a month.
2. Calculate the revenue generated by each machine.
3. Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of widgets produced by each machine in a month.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 60
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days per month: 30
  - Total widgets per month = 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 43,200 widgets

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 45
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days per month: 30
  - Total widgets per month = 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 32,400 widgets

**Step 2: Calculate the revenue generated by each machine.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Total revenue = 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Total revenue = 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

**Step 3: Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.**

- Difference in revenue = Revenue from Widgeteer 3000 - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000
- Difference in revenue = $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

Therefore, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"First, let's calculate the total hours Cameron will stay at the hotel. He arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.

Next, we need to determine the cost for the first 12 hours and the additional hours after that. The cost for the first 12 hours is 1000 pesos. For the additional hours, the cost is 70 pesos per hour.

The number of additional hours after the first 12 hours is:
\[ 17 - 12 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

The cost for these additional 5 hours is:
\[ 5 \times 70 = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay, including the additional hours, is:
\[ 1000 + 350 = 1350 \text{ pesos} \]

If Cameron had paid for a 24-hour stay, the cost would have been 1600 pesos. Therefore, the amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour plus additional hours option is:
\[ 1600 - 1350 = 250 \text{ pesos} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. According to the problem, each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds, so twice that amount is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pounds. Therefore, each sheep needs \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds of hay.

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each needs 5 pounds of hay. So, the total hay for the goats is \(15 \times 5 = 75\) pounds.

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each needs 7 pounds of hay. So, the total hay for the sheep is \(12 \times 7 = 84\) pounds.

Finally, we add the total hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the overall total. The total hay needed is \(75 + 84 = 159\) pounds.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{159}

"First, let's calculate how much John earned in the week. He earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to account for the expenses. John spends $50 on gas, so his remaining money is:
\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John also wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so his remaining money after the deposit is:
\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to subtract the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs $10 and he buys 5 pencils, so the total cost for the pencils is:
\[ 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} \times 5 \text{ pencils} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from his remaining money gives:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many $25 pens he can buy with the remaining $100. The number of pens he can buy is:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ dollars}}{25 \text{ dollars/pen}} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled out. Craig has spelled out 20 words, each with 15 letters. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig has spelled is:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Next, we know that Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled is:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the number of letters Craig has spelled to the number of letters his brother has spelled:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

\[ 650 \]"
"To determine the total number of children participating in the mass drill, we need to calculate the number of children from each school and then sum them up.

"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming all her coupons. Since each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice and the teacher has 9 coupons, the total number of bottles is:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the teacher has \(\boxed{842}\) bottles of apple juice for herself."
"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing job, we need to consider the following components:

1. **Visit Charge**: $40
2. **Labor Charge**: $35 per hour, or part thereof, for 2.25 hours. Since the charge is per hour or part thereof, we round up 2.25 hours to 3 hours (as partial hours are charged as full hours). Therefore, the labor charge is $35 * 3 = $105.
3. **Parts Charge**: $60

Now, we add these charges together:

\[ \text{Total Charge} = \text{Visit Charge} + \text{Labor Charge} + \text{Parts Charge} \]
\[ \text{Total Charge} = 40 + 105 + 60 \]
\[ \text{Total Charge} = 205 \]

Therefore, Patty charged a total of $205 for the job."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount:

\[ 10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.40 \times \$150 = \$60 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:

\[ \$150 - \$60 = \$90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each:

\[ 5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40 \text{ per CD} = \$200 \]

Now, we need to determine how much money James was out after selling 5 of the CDs. The amount he was out initially was $90, and he received $200 from selling 5 CDs. Therefore, the net amount he was out is:

\[ \$90 - \$200 = -\$110 \]

Since the question asks how much money he was out, and the negative value indicates he gained money, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"To calculate how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to multiply the quantity of each type of root crop by its respective price and then sum up the totals.

1. For yams: \(6 \text{ yams} \times \$1.5 \text{ per yam} = \$9\)
2. For sweet potatoes: \(10 \text{ sweet potatoes} \times \$2 \text{ per sweet potato} = \$20\)
3. For carrots: \(4 \text{ carrots} \times \$1.25 \text{ per carrot} = \$5\)

Now, we add up the totals from each type of root crop:
\[
\$9 + \$20 + \$5 = \$34
\]

Therefore, if Jen sells everything, she will earn \(\$34\)."
"First, let's calculate the distance James swims before resting. He swims 60% of the 20-mile lake:

\[ 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes to swim this distance. Since he swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

After swimming, he rests for half as long as the swimming time:

\[ \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, he swims the remaining distance. The remaining distance is:

\[ 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

He swims the remaining distance at half his original speed, which is 1 mile per hour:

\[ \text{Time to swim 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we add up all the times to find the total time to get across the lake:

\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \) (the total points scored by the team)
2. \( B = A + 20 \) (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)
3. \( B = D + 10 \) (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) in the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 25 \) back to find \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \( 5 \) points.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"

"First, let's determine the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and ended at 11:00 PM.

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we need to convert this time into minutes because Vince's stapling rate is given in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes, we divide:

\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:

\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep, excluding the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Usual Sleep Duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - The total sleep duration is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours.
   - Converting 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Time Kim Was Sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is \(2:38 - 2:15 = 23\) minutes.

3. **Time Kim Was Awake Before Her Usual Wake-Up Time:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.
   - The time from 6 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 5 minutes.

4. **Total Time Kim Was Not Asleep:**
   - Total time not asleep includes the time she was sleepwalking and the time she was awake before her usual wake-up time.
   - Total time not asleep: \(23 + 5 = 28\) minutes.

5. **Time Kim Actually Slept:**
   - Subtract the time not asleep from the usual sleep duration.
   - Time Kim slept: \(480 - 28 = 452\) minutes.

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring cups Jonathan has. Since he has two dozen cups, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has. According to the problem, he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons is:

**Final answer: 100 unoccupied beds.**"
"First, let's determine the number of emails that are not work emails. Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day, and 7 of these are work emails. Therefore, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 9 non-work emails are sent to family. Two-thirds of the 9 non-work emails are sent to family:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

This means that 6 emails are sent to family. The remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. To find out how many emails are sent to her boyfriend, we subtract the number of family emails from the non-work emails:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

One-third of the remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. Since the remaining emails are 3, we calculate one-third of 3:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"

"If Courtney reported 48 people and Kelly said that Courtney had overstated the number by 20%, we need to find the actual number of people that attended the concert.

Let's denote the actual number of people who attended the concert as \( x \).

According to Kelly, Courtney's number (48) is 120% of the actual number of people (since 100% + 20% = 120%). This can be expressed as:
\[ 48 = 1.2x \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"To solve this problem, let's define the number of balls each boy carried based on the information given.

Let \( J \) represent the number of balls Jeffrey carried. According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by all three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each boy:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

Now, we can find the number of balls each boy carried:
- Jeffrey carried \( J = 1 \) ball.
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by all three boys is:

"Let's define the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \).

According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught. Therefore, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan can be expressed as:
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokemon caught by Alex can be expressed as:
\[ X = S + 5 = (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \]

Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon, so we can write the equation:
\[ A + S + X = 339 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( S \) and \( X \) in terms of \( A \) into the equation, we get:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Adding 21 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 9A = 360 \]

Dividing both sides by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we know \( A = 40 \), we can find the number of Pokemon caught by Stan:
\[ S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is:
\[ \boxed{147} \]"

   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: Northerly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Next, we sum the distances traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction:

- Total distance traveled southerly: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \)
- Total distance traveled northerly: \( 36 \text{ miles} \)

The net distance traveled in the southerly direction is:

"First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially bought:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave away:
\[ 2 \text{ boxes to her mom} + 2 \text{ boxes to her sister} = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtract the boxes given away from the total number of boxes:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} - 4 \text{ boxes} = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining boxes:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 \text{ boxes} = 2 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtract the boxes she kept from the remaining boxes to find out how many boxes she sold:
\[ 8 \text{ boxes} - 2 \text{ boxes} = 6 \text{ boxes} \]

Since each box contains 20 oranges, we calculate the total number of oranges she sold:

"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of states in India} = \frac{x}{2} + 4 \]

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \]

Simplifying the expression:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \). Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is:

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Next, we need to determine how much more money Tyler needs to afford the books. He has already saved $14, so we subtract this from the total cost:

Amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide the amount needed by his hourly wage:

Hours needed = $25 / $5 per hour = 5 hours

Therefore, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"First, let's determine how many cherries Richard has. According to the problem, Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard. Since Robert has 30 cherries, we can find the number of cherries Richard has by subtracting 10 from Robert's total:

\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \]

So, Richard has 20 cherries.

Next, we know the total number of cherries shared by Richard, Jerry, and Robert is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the number of cherries Richard and Robert have from the total:

\[ 60 - (30 + 20) = 60 - 50 = 10 \]

So, Jerry has 10 cherries.

Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. We do this by subtracting the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:

\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Therefore, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of boxes sold for each type of baked good on both Saturday and Sunday, and then calculate the total earnings.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( G_S \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday.
- Let \( A_S \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday.
- Let \( G_U \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday.
- Let \( A_U \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday.

From the problem, we know:
1. On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread, so \( G_S = 10 \).
2. On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so \( A_S = A_U - 4 \).
3. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so \( G_U = G_S + 5 \).
4. On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie, so \( A_U = 15 \).

Using the information above, we can find the number of boxes sold on Saturday:
- \( G_S = 10 \)
- \( A_S = A_U - 4 = 15 - 4 = 11 \)

Now, we can find the number of boxes sold on Sunday:
- \( G_U = G_S + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15 \)
- \( A_U = 15 \)

Next, we calculate the total earnings for each day:
- Earnings from gingerbread on Saturday: \( 10 \times 6 = 60 \) dollars
- Earnings from apple pie on Saturday: \( 11 \times 15 = 165 \) dollars
- Total earnings on Saturday: \( 60 + 165 = 225 \) dollars

- Earnings from gingerbread on Sunday: \( 15 \times 6 = 90 \) dollars
- Earnings from apple pie on Sunday: \( 15 \times 15 = 225 \) dollars
- Total earnings on Sunday: \( 90 + 225 = 315 \) dollars

Finally, we add the earnings from both days to get the total earnings:
\[ 225 + 315 = 540 \]

Therefore, Sunny earned a total of \(\boxed{540}\) dollars for the two days."
"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of sunscreen Pamela will use over the 8 days.
2. Determine how many bottles are required based on the total usage.

First, we calculate the total amount of sunscreen used per day:
- Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour.
- She will be outside for 4 hours a day.
- Therefore, she uses \(1 \, \text{ounce/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours/day} = 4 \, \text{ounces/day}\).

Next, we calculate the total amount of sunscreen used over 8 days:
- She uses 4 ounces of sunscreen per day.
- Over 8 days, she will use \(4 \, \text{ounces/day} \times 8 \, \text{days} = 32 \, \text{ounces}\).

Now, we determine how many bottles are needed:
- Each bottle contains 8 ounces of sunscreen.
- To find the number of bottles, we divide the total ounces needed by the ounces per bottle: \(32 \, \text{ounces} \div 8 \, \text{ounces/bottle} = 4 \, \text{bottles}\).

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack \(\boxed{4}\) bottles of sunscreen."
"First, let's determine the price of the red car. Since the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, we can calculate the price of the red car as follows:

1. Calculate 40% of the price of the blue car:
\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$100 = 0.40 \times 100 = \$40 \]

2. Subtract this amount from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car:
\[ \$100 - \$40 = \$60 \]

Now, we add the price of the blue car and the red car to find the total cost:
\[ \$100 + \$60 = \$160 \]

Therefore, the total cost of both cars is:
\[ \$160 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Emil's age when he turns 24:**
   - Emil is currently 19 years old.
   - He will turn 24 in \(24 - 19 = 5\) years.

2. **Determine the age of Emil's dad when Emil is 24:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
   - Let \(D\) be the age of Emil's dad when Emil is 24.
   - Therefore, \(24 = \frac{1}{2}D\).
   - Solving for \(D\), we get \(D = 24 \times 2 = 48\).

3. **Determine the age of Emil's brother when Emil is 24:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
   - Let \(B\) be the age of Emil's brother when Emil is 24.
   - Therefore, \(24 = 2B\).
   - Solving for \(B\), we get \(B = \frac{24}{2} = 12\).

4. **Determine the current ages of Emil's dad and brother:**
   - Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his dad will be \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old now.
   - Similarly, his brother will be \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old now.

5. **Calculate the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother:**
   - The sum of their ages is \(43 + 7 = 50\).

Therefore, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.
2. Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, which means her sister gave her \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.
3. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which means her friend gave her \(20 \times 2 = 40\) beads.

Now, let's add up all the beads:

- Beads from her mother: 20
- Beads from her sister: 30
- Beads from her friend: 40

Total beads = 20 + 30 + 40 = 90

Adrianne had 90 beads altogether."
"First, let's determine the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day.

- On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
- On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) pounds.

Next, we sum the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[3 \text{ (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ (Friday)} + 6 \text{ (Saturday)} = 21 \text{ pounds}\]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we divide the total pounds of crawfish by 3 to find the number of servings:
\[\frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings}\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
7

"First, let's determine how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class of 30 students are football players, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are football players.

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after accounting for the football players:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We calculate 25% of 24:

\[ 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are cheerleaders or part of the band.

Now, we add the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members to find the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, we determine the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's and Sophie wears size five boots, we calculate Charlie's boot size as follows:

\[ \text{Charlie's boot size} = 5 \times \text{Sophie's boot size} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Next, we find the average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie. The average is calculated by adding the sizes together and then dividing by the number of people:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Charlie's boot size} + \text{Sophie's boot size}}{2} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Therefore, the average size of shoe worn by the two is:

\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the width of the plants and the space between them are given in feet and inches, we'll convert everything to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 12 inches is 1 foot.

Each plant, including the space between it and the next plant, takes up 1 foot + 1.5 feet = 2.5 feet.

Now, let's calculate how many plants can fit in the 111 feet long flower bed. We divide the total length of the flower bed by the space each plant requires:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:

\[ 44 - 17 = 27 \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:

\[ 27 \times 6 = 162 \]

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"First, we need to determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats per day. Since Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we calculate:

\[ \text{Pretzels eaten by brother per day} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

Next, to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\[ \text{Pretzels eaten by brother in a week} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

Therefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"First, let's calculate the cost for one hanging basket:

- Katherine wants to add 3 petunias to each basket. Each petunia costs $3.00, so the cost for petunias in one basket is \(3 \times 3.00 = \$9.00\).
- She also wants to add 2 sweet potato vines to each basket. Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50, so the cost for sweet potato vines in one basket is \(2 \times 2.50 = \$5.00\).

Adding these together, the total cost for one basket is \(9.00 + 5.00 = \$14.00\).

Since Katherine has 5 hanging baskets, the total cost for all baskets is \(5 \times 14.00 = \$70.00\).

Therefore, Katherine will spend \(\$70.00\) filling all 5 hanging baskets."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. Since they plant 4 sunflowers, the total soil used for sunflowers is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. Since they plant 10 carnations, the total soil used for carnations is \(10 \times 1.5 = 15\) pounds.

Next, we add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations to find the total soil used for these plants:
\[12 + 15 = 27\] pounds.

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. Therefore, the amount of soil left for planting roses is:
\[30 - 27 = 3\] pounds.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[3 \div 1 = 3\] roses.

Final numerical answer:
\[
3
\]"
"First, let's calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times 2000 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with the $500.00 she sets aside each month. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

\[ \text{Number of shoes per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \]

Since she can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0.5 pairs per month, which means she can buy 1 pair every 2 months.

Now, let's calculate how many pairs she can buy in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

\[ \text{Number of pairs per year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months per pair}} = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Emily to both peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's break down the tasks:
1. **Peeling Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{6} = 15 \) minutes.

2. **Sautéing Shrimp:**
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To sauté 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{30} \times 10 = 3 \times 10 = 30 \) minutes.

Since these tasks can be done sequentially, we add the time for peeling and sautering:
- Total time = Time to peel + Time to sauté = 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

**Final Answer: 45 minutes.**"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Low Speed Cooling:**
   - The air conditioner cools at 2 degrees per hour on low.
   - It ran on low for 3 hours.
   - Total cooling during this period: \(2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 6 \, \text{degrees}\).

2. **High Speed Cooling:**
   - The air conditioner cools at 3 degrees per hour on high.
   - It ran on high for 4 hours.
   - Total cooling during this period: \(3 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 12 \, \text{degrees}\).

3. **No Air Conditioner Running:**
   - The room warms up at 2 degrees per hour without the air conditioner.
   - It was turned off for 2 hours.
   - Total warming during this period: \(2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{degrees}\).

4. **Net Temperature Change:**
   - Total cooling: \(6 \, \text{degrees} + 12 \, \text{degrees} = 18 \, \text{degrees}\).
   - Total warming: \(4 \, \text{degrees}\).
   - Net temperature change: \(18 \, \text{degrees} - 4 \, \text{degrees} = 14 \, \text{degrees}\).

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - Let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet as \( D \).
   - According to the problem, Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. So, \( D = 30 \).

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \) years old.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
   - The time interval between the two sightings is 75 years.

4. **Calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and the interval between the two sightings is 75 years, then he was \( 90 - 75 = 15 \) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the frequency of each type of check and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

2. **Gas bill**: Similarly, he writes one check per month for the gas bill, which also results in:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

3. **Church**: Buford writes two checks per month to the church. Over a year, this amounts to:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ checks}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service**: He writes one check every quarter (3 months) to the pest and lawn service. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes:
   \[
   4 \text{ checks}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52 \text{ checks}
\]

Therefore, Buford writes a total of 52 checks per year."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of flights the first plane makes:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips.
   - These 44 trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 44 \times 2 = 88 \) trips in one day.

2. **Determine the distribution of the first plane's flights:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany.
   - So, the first plane goes to Greece for \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \) flights.
   - The remaining flights are \( 88 - 66 = 22 \).
   - These 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, so each destination gets \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \) flights.

Therefore, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is \( \boxed{11} \)."
"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl:

1. **Tobias's howl**: 20 seconds.
2. **Chikote's howl**: Twice as long as Tobias's howl, so \(20 \times 2 = 40\) seconds.
3. **Igneous's howl**: The combined length of Tobias's and Chikote's howls, so \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Next, we calculate the total combined length of their howls in seconds:
\[ 20 \text{ seconds (Tobias)} + 40 \text{ seconds (Chikote)} + 60 \text{ seconds (Igneous)} = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[ \frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money Adam's father gave him.
2. Add the amounts given by his mother and father to find the total amount of money given to Adam.
3. Subtract this total from the cost of the trousers to find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings.

Let's go through each step in detail:

1. Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother. Since his mother gave him $6, his father gave him:
   \[
   2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. The total amount of money given to Adam by his mother and father is:
   \[
   6 + 12 = 18 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. The cost of the trousers is $30. Therefore, the amount of money Adam had to contribute from his savings is:
   \[
   30 - 18 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \( A \), \( B \), \( H \), and \( W \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
- \( A = 3 \) (Akbar's age)
- \( B = 4 \) (Alessandro's age)
- The total age of the children is 20, so \( A + B + H + W = 20 \).
- Helene's age \( H \) is twice the average age of the group.

First, we can express the total age equation as:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we know that Helene's age \( H \) is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

So, Helene's age \( H \) is:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, substituting \( H = 10 \) into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."

"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception. With 100 guests and each bringing a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, the bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

If each person in the church next door received 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is:

"To solve this problem, let's define the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Therefore, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is \( 2 + 4 = 6 \).

The total size of the watermelon can be represented as the sum of all the slices:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

This means the total watermelon is divided into \( 8x \) parts.

Each adult gets \( 2x \) of these parts. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Total}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on inpatient rounds. Since he has 9 inpatients and it takes 20 minutes per inpatient, the total time for rounds is:

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes/inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the appointments. He has 10 appointments, each taking 30 minutes:

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes/appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 480 minutes to hours:

\[ 480 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic. Subtracting the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments from the total time at the clinic gives us the time left for updating records:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to work backwards from the 5:00 pm serving time, accounting for all the steps required to make the cake.

1. **Frosting the cake:** 10 minutes
2. **Cooling the cake:** 2 hours (120 minutes)
3. **Baking the cake:** 30 minutes
4. **Making the cake batter:** 20 minutes

Adding these times together:
\[ 10 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours. Therefore, Jordan needs to start 3 hours before 5:00 pm.

\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

So, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

1. Calculate the cost per session for the studio.
2. Calculate the total cost per day for the studio.
3. Calculate the total cost per week for the studio.
4. Calculate the total cost per month for the studio.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost per session for the studio.**

The cost per session includes a fixed cost of $25 for renting the studio plus a variable cost of $1.50 per student per session. With 10 students, the cost per session is:
\[ 25 + (1.50 \times 10) = 25 + 15 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost per day for the studio.**

The studio is rented 3 days a week, so the total cost per day is:
\[ 40 \times 3 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost per week for the studio.**

Assuming there are 4 weeks in a month, the total cost per week is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes and then find the difference.

First, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes. Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars. We can set up the equation:
\[ 4 \times \text{(number of chocolate bars per box)} = 64 \]
Dividing both sides by 4, we get:
\[ \text{Number of chocolate bars per box for Peter} = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]

Next, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes. Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars. We can set up the equation:
\[ 7 \times \text{(number of chocolate bars per box)} = 56 \]
Dividing both sides by 7, we get:
\[ \text{Number of chocolate bars per box for Martha} = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha. We subtract the number of chocolate bars per box for Martha from the number of chocolate bars per box for Peter:
\[ 16 - 8 = 8 \]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."

"First, we need to calculate the volume of the swimming pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, so we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

First, calculate \( 25 \times 14 \):

\[ 25 \times 14 = 350 \]

Next, multiply the result by 4:

\[ 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the number of gallons:

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

Calculating this:

\[ 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \]

So, the pool needs 8260 gallons of water.

Finally, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

Calculating this:

\[ 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"To determine the total number of sticks, we need to calculate the number of each type of stick and then sum them up.

1. **Red Sticks**: There are 9 red sticks.
2. **Blue Sticks**: There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. Therefore, the number of blue sticks is:
   \[
   9 + 5 = 14
   \]
3. **Yellow Sticks**: The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Therefore, the number of yellow sticks is:
   \[
   14 - 3 = 11
   \]

Now, we sum up all the sticks:
\[
9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34
\]

**Final Answer**: 34"
"To determine how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

The formula to calculate distance is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

For Shandy:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we find the difference in the distances traveled by Shandy and Matteo:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."

"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run in one hour based on the information given:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps in one hour.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps in one hour.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps in one hour.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps. The difference is:

\[10 - 5 = 5\]

So, Bethany can run \(\boxed{5}\) more laps compared to Quinn."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:**
   - The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons.
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge, accounting for the different rates of charge loss.

1. **Final Charge Calculation:**
   - After 8 hours, the power bank was at 28% charge.

2. **Charge Loss in the Last 3 Hours:**
   - For the last 3 hours, the power bank lost 7% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge would be \( x - 3 \times 7\% \) of \( x \).
   - This can be written as \( x - 0.21x = 0.79x \).
   - We know that \( 0.79x = 28\% \).

   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{28\%}{0.79} \approx 35.44\%
   \]

3. **Charge Loss in the First 5 Hours:**
   - For the first 5 hours, the power bank lost 9% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge would be \( y - 5 \times 9\% \) of \( y \).
   - This can be written as \( y - 0.45y = 0.55y \).
   - We know that \( 0.55y = 35.44\% \).

   Solving for \( y \):
   \[
   y = \frac{35.44\%}{0.55} \approx 64.43\%
   \]

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately \( 64.43\% \).

"First, let's calculate Janet's total earnings per hour from both wages and tips:

- Wages: $10/hour
- Tips: $15/hour

Total earnings per hour = $10 + $15 = $25/hour

Next, we calculate her weekly earnings by multiplying her hourly earnings by the number of hours she works in a week:

- Hours worked per week: 40

Weekly earnings = $25/hour * 40 hours/week = $1000/week

Now, let's determine the amount Janet wants to save for the down payment:

- Cost of the car: $10000
- Percentage to save: 20%

Amount to save = 20% of $10000 = 0.20 * $10000 = $2000

Finally, we calculate how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2000:

- Weekly savings: $1000/week

Number of weeks needed = $2000 / $1000/week = 2 weeks

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jamaar has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the items already purchased:
\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount he has is:
\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums. 

Final numerical answer:
\[
\boxed{3}

"First, let's calculate the total number of sweets Anne has:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack contains 60 pieces, so the total number of pieces she gave to her friends is:

\[ 13 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne has 10 friends, and she distributed the sweets equally among them. Therefore, the number of pieces each friend received is:

\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, given that the price increases by 5% each year, we can use the formula for compound interest, which in this context is the formula for compound price increase:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the final price after \( n \) years.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price.
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (expressed as a decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% increase)
- \( n = 3 \) years

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be \( \boxed{139} \) dollars."
"First, we need to determine how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she evenly distributed 72 pictures into 8 albums, we divide 72 by 8:

\[ 72 \div 8 = 9 \]

So, each album contains 9 pictures.

Next, we know that 3 of the albums are selfies only and 2 of the albums are portraits only. This means there are:

\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \]

albums that are either selfies or portraits. Since each of these 5 albums contains 9 pictures, the total number of selfies and portraits is:

\[ 5 \times 9 = 45 \]

Therefore, the total number of portraits and selfies Olivia had is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"First, we need to determine how long it takes James to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time per page as follows:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Guests**: The hotel starts with 100 guests.
2. **Early Checkouts**: 24 guests checked out early. So, the number of guests after early checkouts is:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. **Late Checkouts**: 15 guests checked out late. So, the number of guests after late checkouts is:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. **Afternoon Checkins**: Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, the number of guests who checked in in the afternoon is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   So, the number of guests after the afternoon checkins is:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
5. **Dinner Checkins**: 7 more people checked in after dinner was served. So, the number of guests after the dinner checkins is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( S \) be the number of small stuffed animals sold.
   - Let \( L \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold.
   - The price of a small stuffed animal is $4.
   - The price of a large stuffed animal is \( 3 \times 4 = $12 \).

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - According to the problem, Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so \( S = 2L \).
   - The total earnings from the sales are $120. Therefore, the equation for total earnings is \( 4S + 12L = 120 \).

3. **Substitute \( S \) in the Earnings Equation:**
   - Since \( S = 2L \), substitute \( 2L \) for \( S \) in the earnings equation:
     \[
     4(2L) + 12L = 120
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     8L + 12L = 120
     \]
     \[
     20L = 120
     \]
   - Solve for \( L \):
     \[
     L = \frac{120}{20} = 6
     \]

4. **Find \( S \):**
   - Since \( S = 2L \):
     \[
     S = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.5
   - If a substitute teacher is present, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
   - Probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework in this scenario: 0%

2. **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher being present: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.4
   - Probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework in this scenario: 100% - 40% = 60% or 0.6
   - Combined probability for this scenario: \(0.5 \times 0.6 = 0.3\) or 30%

3. **Normal Teacher without Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher being present: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.6
   - Probability that Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment: 20% or 0.2
   - Probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework in this scenario: 100% - 20% = 80% or 0.8
   - Combined probability for this scenario: \(0.5 \times 0.6 \times 0.8 = 0.24\) or 24%

Now, we sum the probabilities of the scenarios where Marcus does not get an extension:

- Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.5
- Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 30% or 0.3
- Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus getting a personal extension: 24% or 0.24

Total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:
\[0.5 + 0.3 + 0.24 = 1.04\]

However, since the probabilities should sum to 100%, we need to correct for the overlap in the scenarios. The correct calculation is:

\[1 - (0.5 \times 0.6 \times 0.8) = 1 - 0.24 = 0.76\]

Thus, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:
\[0.76 \times 100 = 76\%\]

"First, we need to determine the total number of seats that are not reserved for graduates and faculty. The Fine Arts Center has a total capacity of 6000 seats. Subtracting the 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty, we get:

\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 \]

These 4750 seats are available for distribution to the graduates to give to their friends and family. Since the tickets are to be split equally among the graduates, we need to know the number of graduates. However, the number of graduates is not provided in the question. Let's assume the number of graduates is \( G \).

The number of tickets each graduate would receive is:

\[ \frac{4750}{G} \]

Without the specific number of graduates, we cannot provide a numerical answer. If you can provide the number of graduates, I can calculate the exact number of tickets each graduate would receive."
"To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish the relationship between the different sizes of jelly beans.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large jelly beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium jelly beans Grandpa can eat is \( 2 \times 75 = 150 \).

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium jelly bean.
   - Therefore, the number of small jelly beans equivalent to one medium jelly bean is 3.

To find out how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we use the number of medium jelly beans he can eat and convert them to small jelly beans:
- Grandpa can eat 150 medium jelly beans.
- Since 3 small jelly beans are equivalent to 1 medium jelly bean, the total number of small jelly beans he can eat is \( 150 \times 3 = 450 \).

**Final Answer:**
Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate her total earnings from the jury duty:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total parking expenses:
\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the parking expenses from her total earnings to find her net earnings:
\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we calculate her net earnings per hour:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

"To determine how long it will take Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we need to calculate the total cost of his education and the lost income during his college years.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the loans:**
   - Jim takes 4 years to finish college.
   - He gets $50,000 in loans per year.
   - Total loan amount = $50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000.

2. **Calculate the lost income during college:**
   - Jim had a job that paid $25,000 per year before college.
   - During college, he lost this income for 4 years.
   - Total lost income = $25,000/year * 4 years = $100,000.

3. **Calculate the total cost (loans + lost income):**
   - Total cost = Total loan amount + Total lost income
   - Total cost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

4. **Calculate Jim's new income after earning a college degree:**
   - His college degree tripled his income.
   - New income = 3 * $25,000 = $75,000 per year.

5. **Determine how long it will take to earn the total cost:**
   - Total cost to be earned = $300,000.
   - New income per year = $75,000.
   - Time to earn the total cost = Total cost / New income per year
   - Time to earn the total cost = $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"First, let's determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces Jim needs. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ \text{Total area} = 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, Jim needs to buy:
\[ \boxed{160} \text{ square feet of fabric} \]"

"Let's define the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:
\[
2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19)
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is \(\boxed{10}\)."

"First, let's determine how many slices Jake ate. According to the problem, Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake. Since Becky ate 10 slices, we can set up the following equation to find out how many slices Jake ate:

\[ \text{Jake's slices} = \text{Becky's slices} - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Next, we need to find out how many slices Silvia ate. The problem states that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Therefore, we can calculate Silvia's slices as follows:

\[ \text{Silvia's slices} = 2 \times \text{Jake's slices} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now, we know the number of slices each person ate:
- Becky ate 10 slices.
- Jake ate 7 slices.
- Silvia ate 14 slices.

To find the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia, we add the slices together:

\[ \text{Total slices} = \text{Becky's slices} + \text{Jake's slices} + \text{Silvia's slices} = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \]

"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, we can express Betsy's part as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for the meal is the sum of both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, we calculate Betsy's part as:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long."

   6 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the costs:
\[
200 \text{ dollars (cast)} + 150 \text{ dollars (visit)} + 120 \text{ dollars (painkillers)} + 12 \text{ dollars (parking)} = 482 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total cost of the doctor's visit is:
\[
\boxed{482}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the number of emails that don't require any response:

20% of 80 emails = 0.20 * 80 = 16 emails

These 16 emails don't need a response, so James responds to the remaining emails:

80 emails - 16 emails = 64 emails

James responds to 64 emails each day. Over a 5-day work week, the number of emails he responds to is:

64 emails/day * 5 days = 320 emails

Therefore, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes for each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: 32 classes visited.
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes.
3. **Wednesday**: Three times as many as Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes.
4. **Thursday**: 30 classes visited.
5. **Friday**: 25 classes visited.

Now, we add the number of classes for each day:

\[
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25
\]

First, add 32 and 64:

\[
32 + 64 = 96
\]

Next, add 96 and 96:

\[
96 + 96 = 192
\]

Then, add 192 and 30:

\[
192 + 30 = 222
\]

Finally, add 222 and 25:

\[
222 + 25 = 247
\]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is:

\[
\boxed{247}

1. John's score for the first 3 tests: \(100 + 100 + 100 = 300\)
2. John's score for the 4th test: \(80\)
3. Total score for all 4 tests: \(300 + 80 = 380\)
4. Number of tests: \(4\)
5. Average score: \(\frac{380}{4} = 95\)

Therefore, John's average score across the 4 tests is \(95\)."
"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate and how many are left from their order.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the glee club's order is:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's determine how many pizzas the football team ordered and how many they ate.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the football team's order is:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas} \]

Finally, we add the remaining pizzas from both the glee club and the football team to find the total number of pizzas left:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, the final number of pizzas left is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each type of coupon Anthony is sending out.

Anthony is sending out 700 small coupons. Since he wants to send out twice as many big coupons, the number of big coupons is:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of the small coupons and the big coupons:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:
\[ 24500 \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:
\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered:**
   - Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches.
   - \(10 - 3 = 7\) meatball sub sandwiches.

2. **Calculate the number of meatballs in the initial order:**
   - Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.
   - \(7 \text{ sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs per sandwich} = 28 \text{ meatballs}\).

3. **Determine how many meatballs were eaten by Mark:**
   - Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches.
   - \(4 \text{ sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs per sandwich} = 16 \text{ meatballs}\).

4. **Calculate the number of meatballs remaining after Mark ate:**
   - \(28 \text{ meatballs} - 16 \text{ meatballs} = 12 \text{ meatballs}\).

5. **Determine the number of additional meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered:**
   - Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches.
   - \(3 \text{ sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs per sandwich} = 12 \text{ meatballs}\).

6. **Calculate the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches:**
   - The remaining meatballs from the initial order plus the additional meatballs from the new order.
   - \(12 \text{ meatballs} + 12 \text{ meatballs} = 24 \text{ meatballs}\).

Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is:
\[
\boxed{24}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures. Since a quarter of the 20 trucks had mechanical failures, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks}
\]

This means that 5 trucks could not deliver the fertiliser. Therefore, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[
20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks}
\]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Thus, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[
15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ tons}
\]

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:

\[
300 \text{ tons}

"Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. Since he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The promotion at the grocery store is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter he buys, he gets a second pound at half the price.

The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound. Under the promotion, the cost for the second pound is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.

For 6 pounds of butter, we can break it down into 3 pairs of pounds. Each pair will cost $4.00 (for the first pound) + $2.00 (for the second pound) = $6.00.

Therefore, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter is 3 pairs * $6.00 per pair = $18.00.

The final numerical answer is:
$18.00"
"First, let's determine the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- Kayla invited 25 classmates.
- She also invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.

So, the total number of guests invited is:
\[ 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 \]

Next, we need to account for the 4 people who said they could not come. Therefore, the number of guests who will actually attend the party is:
\[ 45 - 4 = 41 \]

The cost to rent the theater is $125 for the first 20 guests. For each additional guest beyond the first 20, the cost is $6. The number of additional guests is:
\[ 41 - 20 = 21 \]

The cost for the additional guests is:
\[ 21 \times 6 = 126 \]

Adding the base rental fee to the cost for the additional guests gives the total cost of the party:
\[ 125 + 126 = 251 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the party is:
\[ \boxed{251} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Maggie and Riza each originally had.

Since Maggie spent a quarter of her money and has $60 left, we can set up the equation to find out how much she originally had:
\[ \text{Original amount} - \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Original amount} = 60 \]
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Original amount} = 60 \]
\[ \text{Original amount} = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80 \]

So, Maggie originally had $80.

Similarly, for Riza, who spent one-third of her money and has $60 left, we can set up the equation:
\[ \text{Original amount} - \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Original amount} = 60 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Original amount} = 60 \]
\[ \text{Original amount} = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90 \]

So, Riza originally had $90.

Now, let's calculate how much money each of them has left:
- Maggie has $60 left.
- Riza has $60 left.

Adding the amounts they have left:
\[ 60 + 60 = 120 \]

Therefore, the two of them have a total of $120 left."
"First, let's determine the total number of bananas each monkey eats in a week.

Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas for a week, which is 7 days. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by the three monkeys in a week is 315.

Next, we calculate the daily banana consumption for each monkey:

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so it eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.
3. Let the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day be \(x\).

The total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week is the sum of the bananas eaten by each monkey over 7 days. This can be expressed as:
\[7 \times (10 + 14 + x) = 315\]

Simplifying inside the parentheses:
\[7 \times (24 + x) = 315\]

Dividing both sides by 7:
\[24 + x = 45\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[x = 45 - 24\]
\[x = 21\]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

Final answer:
The third monkey eats 21 bananas each day."
"Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed 250 pieces. Then, he started and finished another 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed an additional 500 pieces.

To find the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we add the pieces from both puzzles together:

250 pieces (from the first puzzle) + 500 pieces (from the second puzzle) = 750 pieces

Therefore, Teddy placed 750 puzzle pieces during that hour."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 15 roses. Since roses can be bought at $2 each, the cost for 15 roses is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has. She arrived with five $5 bills, so the total amount of money she has is:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she does not have enough money to buy 15 roses at the per-rose price. Therefore, she would need to buy the roses at the dozen price. 

The cost for a dozen roses is $15. Since 15 roses is equivalent to 1 dozen and 3 individual roses, she can buy 1 dozen roses and 3 individual roses. The cost for 1 dozen roses is $15, and the cost for 3 individual roses is:

\[ 3 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$6 \]

So, the total cost for 15 roses is:

\[ \$15 + \$6 = \$21 \]

Jenny has $25, so the change she will receive is:

\[ \$25 - \$21 = \$4 \]

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in $1, so in $4 there are:

\[ 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, the number of quarters Jenny leaves with is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To calculate the total money Terry makes, we need to calculate the earnings from each item and then sum them up.

2. **Burger Platters:**
   - Number of burger platters: 9
   - Price per burger platter: $11
   - Total from burger platters: \(9 \times 11 = 99.00\)

3. **Sodas:**
   - Number of sodas: 20
   - Price per soda: $1.50
   - Total from sodas: \(20 \times 1.50 = 30.00\)

Now, we sum up the totals from each item:
\[33.00 + 99.00 + 30.00 = 162.00\]

Therefore, the total money Terry makes is \(\boxed{162.00}\)."
"Let's break down the timeline step by step to determine when Paul's train arrives and how long he waits.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Leaves after 30 minutes (10 minutes to arrive + 20 minutes to stay).

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves (30 minutes after the first train arrives, which is 40 minutes from the start).
   - Stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes.
   - Leaves after 45 minutes (40 minutes to arrive + 5 minutes to stay).

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train leaves (60 minutes from the start).
   - Leaves immediately after arriving, so it leaves at 60 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves (80 minutes from the start).
   - This is the train Paul will board.

Paul arrives at the station at the start (0 minutes). The fourth train arrives at 80 minutes. Therefore, Paul will wait for 80 minutes.

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has saved is:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to determine how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to reach her goal of 200 toothpicks. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of toothpicks she already has from her goal:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie continues to save at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week, we can find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks by dividing the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie \(\boxed{8}\) more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price.

Original price of the watch = $2000

Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for = 75% of $2000
\[ = 0.75 \times 2000 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for = 120% of $1500
\[ = 1.20 \times 1500 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price of the watch.

The original price of the watch = $2000
The price Mr. Rogers' friend paid = $1800

Discount = Original price - Price paid by friend
\[ = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

Percentage discount = \(\frac{\text{Discount}}{\text{Original price}} \times 100\)
\[ = \frac{200}{2000} \times 100 = 10\% \]

Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%."
"To determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, a single spring creates 1 jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - 1 hour = 3600 seconds
   - 4 hours = 4 × 3600 = 14400 seconds

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since 1 jellyfish is created every second, in 14400 seconds, one spring will create 14400 jellyfish.

4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create 5 × 14400 jellyfish.

5. **Final calculation:**
   - 5 × 14400 = 72000

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is **72000**."
"To find Frankie's score, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that Binkie's score is 90, and Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score.

First, we calculate twice Binkie's score:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Next, we add 15 to this result to find Frankie's score:
\[ 180 + 15 = 195 \]

Therefore, Frankie's score is 195."
"To determine how long it took James to reach the store, we need to consider the total distance he walked and his walking speed.

1. James's home is 4 miles from the store.
2. He walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles.
3. He then walked back home, covering another 2 miles.
4. Therefore, the total distance he walked is \(2 + 2 = 4\) miles.
5. James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.

To find the time it took, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, it took James 1 hour to reach the store."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from buying 10 bunches. Since each bunch averages 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we calculate the cost if Jenny had bought these bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80, so the total cost for 40 bananas is:

\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since she bought 10 bunches and each bunch costs $3.00, the total cost is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:

\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the following equation to represent the total length of the fence:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so the growth rate is:

\[ \text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Next, we use this growth rate to find out how much the crocodile will grow in 13 years:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the crocodile will grow \(\boxed{26}\) inches in 13 years."
"First, let's determine the number of each type of bike sold.

1. **Trekking Bikes:**
   - Half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes.
   - Number of Trekking bikes = \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \).

2. **BMX Bikes:**
   - 15% of the 300 bikes sold were BMX bikes.
   - Number of BMX bikes = \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \).

3. **MTB Bikes:**
   - The rest of the bikes sold were MTB bikes.
   - Number of MTB bikes = Total bikes - Trekking bikes - BMX bikes
   - Number of MTB bikes = \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \).

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike.

1. **Earnings from Trekking Bikes:**
   - Price of one Trekking bike = $450.
   - Total earnings from Trekking bikes = \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \).

2. **Earnings from BMX Bikes:**
   - Price of one BMX bike = \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \).
   - Total earnings from BMX bikes = \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \).

3. **Earnings from MTB Bikes:**
   - Price of one MTB bike = $500.
   - Total earnings from MTB bikes = \( 105 \times 500 = 52500 \).

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes to find the total earnings.

- Total earnings = Earnings from Trekking bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from MTB bikes
- Total earnings = \( 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = 131250 \).

Therefore, Marcel earned \(\boxed{131250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."
"To determine how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the net number of bales added to or removed from the field each hour and then multiply by the number of hours in a workday.

1. The farmer makes 5 bales of hay each hour.
2. The truck picks up 3 bales of hay each hour.
3. The net change in the number of bales each hour is \(5 - 3 = 2\) bales.

Over a 6-hour day, the total change in the number of bales is:
\[2 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ bales}.\]

Since the farmer is making more bales than the truck is picking up, the number of bales in the field increases by 12 bales over the 6-hour day.

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field at the end of the day is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long.

Total class time per day = 8 classes * 40 minutes/class = 320 minutes

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total class time for the week is:

Total class time per week = 320 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes/week

Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly class time on these days.

Extra learning time per week = 1600 minutes/week * (1/16) = 100 minutes/week

Now, we add the class time and the extra learning time to get the total learning time per week:

Total learning time per week = 1600 minutes/week + 100 minutes/week = 1700 minutes/week

To convert the total learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

Total learning time per week in hours = 1700 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour = 28.3333 hours/week

Therefore, John spends approximately 28.33 hours a week learning."
"To determine how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial drop height:**
   - The ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony.
   - Each story is 24 feet high.
   - Therefore, the initial drop height is \(3 \times 24 = 72\) feet.

2. **Calculate the height after the first bounce:**
   - The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height.
   - So, the height after the first bounce is \(72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48\) feet.

3. **Calculate the height after the second bounce:**
   - The ball again bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its previous height.
   - So, the height after the second bounce is \(48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32\) feet.

Therefore, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is \(\boxed{32}\) feet."
"To determine the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the heights of each child step by step.

1. **First Child:**
   - Height: 6 feet
   - Convert feet to inches: \( 6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches} \)

2. **Second Child:**
   - Height: 2 inches taller than the first child
   - Calculation: \( 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches} \)

3. **Third Child:**
   - Height: 5 inches shorter than the second child
   - Calculation: \( 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches} \)

4. **Fourth Child:**
   - Height: 3 inches taller than the third child
   - Calculation: \( 69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} \)

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is \( 72 \) inches."
"To determine how much the orchard earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bags sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings based on the price per bag.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of bags sold.**

Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total earnings.**

Each bag is sold for $5, so we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which means \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \) kilograms.

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the triceratops initially had 1080 kilograms of meat."
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are 10 feet by 8 feet. Since there are two walls, the total area for these walls is \(2 \times (10 \times 8) = 2 \times 80 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are 5 feet by 8 feet. Since there are two walls, the total area for these walls is \(2 \times (5 \times 8) = 2 \times 40 = 80\) square feet.

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[160 + 80 = 240\] square feet.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[\frac{240}{20} = 12\] gallons.

Finally, since each gallon costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[12 \times 12 = 144\] dollars.

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is \(\boxed{144}\)."
"First, let's determine the initial state of the sodas:
- Ellen starts with a case of 12 sodas.
- She shakes 3 of them.
- She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas in total.
- Now, there are 2 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

Next, Ellen's brother takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas:
- After Ellen's brother takes his share, there are 1 shaken soda and 0 unshaken sodas left.

Now, we need to find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can. Since there is only 1 shaken soda left, the probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 100% if they choose the shaken soda.

The final numerical answer is:
100%"
"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train travels and then sum these distances.

1. The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, the distance it covers is:
   \[
   60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour}
   \]
   After 3 hours, the distance it covers is:
   \[
   30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. The total distance between the two trains after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled:
   \[
   180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles}
   \]

Therefore, the two trains are \(\boxed{270}\) miles apart after 3 hours."
"First, let's calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.

- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days.
- April 1st to April 19th is 19 days.
- Therefore, the total number of days is \(31 + 19 = 50\) days.

Next, we need to determine how many days Billy takes off. He takes 20% of the days off.

- 20% of 50 days is \(0.20 \times 50 = 10\) days.

So, the number of days Billy works is \(50 - 10 = 40\) days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day. Therefore, the number of people he helps per day is:

- \(2 \text{ people/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 6 \text{ people/day}\).

Finally, the total number of people he helps over the 40 days is:

- \(6 \text{ people/day} \times 40 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ people}\).

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{240}
\]"
"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry. 

First, let's calculate the number of people that the buses could carry:
- There were 12 buses.
- Each bus carried 35 people.

So, the total number of people carried by the buses is:
\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people/bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of people that the cars could carry:
- There were 20 cars.
- Each car carried 3 people.

So, the total number of people carried by the cars is:
\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people/car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Now, we add the number of people carried by the buses and the cars to find the total number of people inside the church:
\[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people inside the church is:
\[ \boxed{480} \]"

So, Jeff is 30 years old."
"To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to ride the biggest slide:
- The length of the biggest slide is 300 feet.
- The speed is 60 feet per minute.

\[ \text{Time for the biggest slide} = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide:
- The length of the second biggest slide is 240 feet.
- The speed is 80 feet per minute.

\[ \text{Time for the second biggest slide} = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:
\[ \text{Difference in time} = \text{Time for the biggest slide} - \text{Time for the second biggest slide} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"First, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks each day.

- Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch.
- He also takes 2 breaks of 15 minutes each, which totals 30 minutes.

So, each day, Bobby spends:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes (lunch)} + 30 \text{ minutes (breaks)} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, Bobby spends 1 hour each day on lunch and breaks.

Over 5 days, the total time spent on lunch and breaks is:
\[ 1 \text{ hour/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (\text{Amber's distance} + \text{Micah's distance}) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (8 + 28) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - 36 \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Charge:**
   Sheila initially charged $85.00.

2. **Return of Item:**
   She returned an item that cost $15.00. This reduces her balance:
   \[
   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]

3. **Frying Pan Purchase:**
   The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. The discount amount is:
   \[
   20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00
   \]
   So, the price of the frying pan after the discount is:
   \[
   20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00
   \]

4. **Set of Towels Purchase:**
   The set of towels was on sale for 10% off $30.00. The discount amount is:
   \[
   30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00
   \]
   So, the price of the set of towels after the discount is:
   \[
   30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00
   \]

5. **New Balance Calculation:**
   Adding the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the current balance:
   \[
   70.00 + 16.00 + 27.00 = 113.00

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is:
\[ \frac{J}{5} \]

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15} \]

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \frac{J}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 15:
\[ J = 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

Thus, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"First, let's determine Ben's age. Since Ben is two times older than Chris, and Chris is 4 years old, we calculate Ben's age as follows:

\[ \text{Ben's age} = 2 \times \text{Chris's age} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Next, we calculate Caroline's age. Caroline is three times older than Ben, so we calculate her age as follows:

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old."
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs for her retirement and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount given her current savings rate.

1. **Calculate the annual retirement expense:**
   Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual retirement expense} = 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total retirement savings needed:**
   Lauren plans to live off this amount for 20 years.
   \[
   \text{Total retirement savings needed} = 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the amount Lauren saves per year:**
   Lauren saves 20% of her current annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual savings} = 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of years needed to save the total retirement amount:**
   \[
   \text{Number of years needed} = \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \text{ years}

"To find the total population of the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. Let's denote the total population of the school as \( P \).

Given:
\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation:
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ P = 600 \]

So, the total population of the school is 600.

Next, we need to find the number of girls in the school. Since the total population is 600 and 40% of the population are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls.

The number of girls is:
\[ 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."

- Initial male guppies: 4
- Initial female guppies: 7
- Initial male goldfishes: 3
- Initial female goldfishes: 5

Next, we add the new fish Tate buys:

- New male guppies: 2
- New female guppies: 1
- New male goldfishes: 2
- New female goldfishes: 3

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female guppies and goldfishes after the purchase:

- Total female guppies: 7 (initial) + 1 (new) = 8
- Total male goldfishes: 3 (initial) + 2 (new) = 5
- Total female goldfishes: 5 (initial) + 3 (new) = 8

Now, we combine the totals for guppies and goldfishes:

- Total male fishes: 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11
- Total female fishes: 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16

Finally, we find the difference between the total number of female and male fishes:

- Difference: 16 (female) - 11 (male) = 5

Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time each person took to complete their chores and then sum these times.

1. **Amalia's Time:**
   - Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

2. **Megan's Time:**
   - Megan's chore was to walk the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Therefore, Megan's time = Amalia's time + 2 hours = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours.

3. **Dior's Time:**
   - Dior's chore was to do laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Since ""well over 4 hours"" is not a precise number, we can assume it means at least 5 hours (as it's the smallest integer over 4 hours).
   - Therefore, Dior's time = Amalia's time + 5 hours = 4 hours + 5 hours = 9 hours.

4. **Total Time:**
   - Now, we sum the times for all three chores:
   - Total time = Amalia's time + Megan's time + Dior's time
   - Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours + 9 hours = 19 hours.

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 19 hours."

"First, let's determine how many miles Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can calculate the total distance she will walk in 7 days as follows:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find out how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days:

\[ \text{Distance Brian walks in 7 days} = \frac{\text{Distance Sofie walks in 7 days}}{2} \]

Substituting the distance Sofie walks in 7 days:

\[ \text{Distance Brian walks in 7 days} = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the other four workers and then find out how many toys are still needed to meet the order.

First, let's calculate the total production of the first two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.

Next, let's calculate the total production of the next two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total production of these four workers over a 10-hour shift:
- The first two workers produce \(12 \times 10 = 120\) toys.
- The next two workers produce \(8 \times 10 = 80\) toys.
- Therefore, the total production of these four workers is \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys.

The order requires 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. This means that the total number of toys produced by the four workers is \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys less the 200 toys already calculated, which implies the fifth worker must have produced the remaining toys.

Let's denote the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker as \(x\). Over a 10-hour shift, the fifth worker produces \(10x\) toys. The total production of all five workers is:
\[200 + 10x = 380\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[10x = 380 - 200\]
\[10x = 180\]
\[x = \frac{180}{10}\]
\[x = 18\]

Therefore, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."

   \]

Next, we add the weights of Elijah's dogs together to find the total weight of Elijah's dogs:
\[
\text{Total weight of Elijah's dogs} = 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs to find the combined weight of all the dogs:
\[
\text{Total weight of all dogs} = 60 + 45 = 105 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is:
\[
\boxed{105}

"Let's work backwards from the information given:

1. **Rob received 7 stickers from Kris.** This means Kris had \(7 + 9 = 16\) stickers before giving 7 to Rob.
2. **Kris had 16 stickers, which is half of what Luis gave her.** Therefore, Luis gave Kris \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.
3. **Luis had 32 stickers, which is half of what Seth gave him.** Therefore, Seth gave Luis \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

So, Seth originally had 64 stickers.

**Final answer:**
Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of M&M that John has:

- He buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces.
- Therefore, the total weight is \(3 \times 10 = 30\) ounces.

Next, we need to determine how many M&M are in these 30 ounces:

- Since 1 ounce contains 30 M&M, 30 ounces will contain \(30 \times 30 = 900\) M&M.

Now, we need to find out how many small bags he can make if each small bag contains 10 M&M:

- The total number of small bags is \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \).

Therefore, John can make 90 small bags. 

Final numerical answer:

"To determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate half of the circumference of the earth.
2. Determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly that distance.

First, the circumference of the earth is given as 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Next, we know that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies per day:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

"To determine the speed of the fastest car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use the speed of the 2nd fastest car to find the speed of the fastest car.

First, we know that the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. Therefore, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
\[ 120 \text{ mph} \times 5 = 600 \text{ mph} \]

Next, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is:
\[ 600 \text{ mph} \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ mph} \]

So, the speed of the fastest car is:
\[ \boxed{750} \text{ mph} \]"
"Two years ago, Liam was 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. Therefore, Vince was 7 years old two years ago.

Vince is currently 9 years old. 

Vince is currently 9 years old."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Eggs Painted**: Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 eggs.
2. **Arnold and Madeline**: Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as \( A \) and the number of eggs Madeline painted as \( M \). Since they painted the same number, \( A = M \).
3. **Camden and Sarah**: Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. Let's denote the number of eggs Camden painted as \( C \) and the number of eggs Sarah painted as \( S \). So, \( C + S = 30 \).
4. **Camden Painted 12 More Than Sarah**: Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so \( C = S + 12 \).

Now, we can substitute \( C = S + 12 \) into the equation \( C + S = 30 \):
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]
So, Sarah painted 9 eggs. Since Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, Camden painted:
\[ C = 9 + 12 = 21 \]
So, Camden painted 21 eggs.

Now, we know the total number of eggs painted is 56. We can express this as:
\[ A + M + C + S = 56 \]
Since \( A = M \), we can rewrite it as:
\[ 2A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]
So, Arnold painted 13 eggs.

Finally, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Since each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box, Nik will need 25 boxes.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we calculate the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives us the total weight:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the length of the usable part of the tree:**
   - The tree is 80 feet tall.
   - John can make logs out of 80% of it.
   - Usable length = 80 feet * 80% = 80 * 0.8 = 64 feet.

2. **Calculate the number of 4-foot logs:**
   - Each log is 4 feet long.
   - Number of logs = Usable length / Length of each log = 64 feet / 4 feet = 16 logs.

3. **Calculate the number of planks from each log:**
   - From each log, he cuts 5 planks.
   - Total number of planks = Number of logs * Planks per log = 16 * 5 = 80 planks.

4. **Calculate the total earnings from selling the planks:**
   - Each plank is sold for $1.2.
   - Total earnings = Total number of planks * Price per plank = 80 * $1.2 = $96.

Therefore, John makes $96."
"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns $5000 per month and this is half of what her brother earns, we can calculate her brother's earnings as follows:

\[ \text{Brother's earnings} = 2 \times 5000 = 10000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Valerie and her brother earn combined:

\[ \text{Combined earnings of Valerie and her brother} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so we calculate her earnings as:

\[ \text{Mother's earnings} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Now, we add up the earnings of Valerie, her brother, and their mother to find the total amount of money they all have together:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all have together is:

\[ \boxed{45000} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk, given the different speeds on the beach and the sidewalk.

1. **Determine the speed on the beach:**
   - Grandma spends 40 minutes walking 2 miles on the beach.
   - Speed on the beach = Distance / Time = 2 miles / (40 minutes / 60 minutes per hour) = 2 miles / (2/3 hours) = 3 miles per hour.

2. **Determine the speed on the sidewalk:**
   - The speed on the sidewalk is twice the speed on the beach.
   - Speed on the sidewalk = 2 * 3 miles per hour = 6 miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - Distance on the sidewalk = 1 mile.
   - Time on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed = 1 mile / 6 miles per hour = 1/6 hours.
   - Convert this time to minutes: (1/6 hours) * 60 minutes per hour = 10 minutes.

4. **Calculate the total time for the entire walk:**
   - Time on the beach = 40 minutes.
   - Time on the sidewalk = 10 minutes.
   - Total time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk is 50 minutes."
"First, let's calculate how much Jane has saved so far. She has been saving $4 every week for 8 weeks. Therefore, her total savings so far are:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more she needs to save to reach a total of $60. We subtract her current savings from the target amount:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the amount she needs by her weekly savings:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."

"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob originally has.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. Therefore, if we subtract the 24 marbles he receives from the total of 60 marbles, we can find out how many marbles he originally has:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob originally has 36 marbles.

Next, if Bob loses 10 of his marbles, we subtract 10 from the 36 marbles he originally has:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 of his marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

Final answer:
\[ 26 \]"
"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water, we need to consider the final temperature of the water after Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. Since the final temperature is at least 40 degrees, we can use the concept of weighted averages to find the minimum temperature of the second mug.

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

The total volume of water in the water bottle after pouring is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces.

The total heat content of the water in the bottle can be expressed as:
\[ 4 \times 33 + 1 \times T = 132 + T \]

The average temperature of the water in the bottle is:
\[ \frac{132 + T}{5} \]

We know that this average temperature must be at least 40 degrees:
\[ \frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40 \]

To find \( T \), we solve the inequality:
\[ 132 + T \geq 200 \]
\[ T \geq 200 - 132 \]
\[ T \geq 68 \]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees. 

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels before the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, and Russell orders 4 packs:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total:
\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost per single bagel by dividing the total cost by the total number of bagels:

"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of scoops Gomer ate:**
   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This can be calculated as: \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops.

2. **Determine the relationship between scoops and potatoes:**
   - It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This can be simplified to: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes for \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops.
   - Therefore, 1 scoop requires \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes.

3. **Calculate the number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   - Since 1 scoop requires \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes, 18 scoops will require \( 18 \times \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes.

"To determine the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket:**
   - The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a probability of \(0.20\).
   - The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning for the second ticket is \(3 \times 0.20 = 0.60\) or 60%.

2. **Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners:**
   - The probability of both events happening (both tickets being winners) is the product of their individual probabilities.
   - Therefore, the combined probability is \(0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12\).

3. **Convert the combined probability to a percentage:**
   - To convert the probability to a percentage, multiply by 100.

"First, let's calculate the length of the second song. The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes long.

To find 60% of 5 minutes:
\[ 5 \times 0.60 = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, add this to the original length of the first song to get the length of the second song:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, add the lengths of both songs to get the total length of the cassette:
\[ 5 + 8 = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"First, let's determine the selling price of one mobile device. Linus buys each device for $20 and sells it for twice the original price. Therefore, the selling price of one device is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the profit from selling one device. The profit per device is the selling price minus the buying price:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, so the total number of devices he bought is:

\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ devices} \]

Since he makes a profit of $20 per device, the total profit from selling all 6 devices is:

\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total profit Linus earned after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Isabel's Height**: Isabel is 7 feet tall.
2. **Ned's Height**: Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel. So, Ned's height is:
   \[
   7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. **Carl's Height**: Carl is one foot taller than Ned. So, Carl's height is:
   \[
   5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet}
   \]
4. **Length of Carl's Cane**: Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. So, the length of Carl's cane is:
   \[
   \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is \(\boxed{3}\) feet."
"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would need to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily energy demand for 2300 people:**
   - Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
   - Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, Hortex would need to produce 5 bottles of juice (since \(100\% / 20\% = 5\)).

2. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed for 2300 people:**
   - For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is \(2300 \times 5 = 11500\) bottles.

3. **Determine how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce:**
   - Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.
   - The additional number of bottles needed is \(11500 - 4200 = 7300\) bottles.

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce an additional 7300 bottles of juices to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people."
"First, let's determine the number of octuplets dressed in each color. Since Carla has 8 identical octuplets:

- 3/4 of them are dressed in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- 1/4 of them are dressed in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we need to find out how many of the blue-wearers and purple-wearers also wear bows. 

- All 2 blue-wearers wear bows.
- 1/3 of the 6 purple-wearers wear bows: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of the blue-wearers and the purple-wearers who wear bows:
\[ 2 \text{ (blue)} + 2 \text{ (purple)} = 4 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. Out of the 4 babies wearing bows, 2 are wearing purple. Therefore, the probability is:
\[ \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \]

To convert this to a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\% \]

So, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is:
\[ 50\% \]"
"To find out how many tax reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and Thursday and Friday from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week: 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday: 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday: 2136

First, we calculate the total number of reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:
\[ 1907 + 2136 = 4043 \]

Next, we subtract this total from the overall total to find the number of reports received on Wednesday:
\[ 5168 - 4043 = 1125 \]

Therefore, the number of reports received on Wednesday is:
\[ 1125 \]"
"First, let's determine how much land Abraham sold in the first transaction. He sold half of his 80 square meters of land:

\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ square meters} \]

The price for this land was $50. So, the remaining land after the first sale is:

\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \text{ square meters} \]

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his remaining land. The amount of land sold in the second transaction is:

\[ \frac{40}{4} = 10 \text{ square meters} \]

The price for this land was $30. So, the remaining land after the second sale is:

\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ square meters} \]

Abraham then sold the remaining 30 square meters of land for $3 per square meter. The money earned from this sale is:

\[ 30 \times 3 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add up all the money earned from the three sales:

\[ 50 + 30 + 90 = 170 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is:

\[ \boxed{170} \]"
"To find Geb's age, we start by using the information given in the problem. We know that Haley is 26 years old and Geb is 10 less than half the age of Haley.

First, we calculate half of Haley's age:
\[ \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

Next, we subtract 10 from this result to find Geb's age:
\[ 13 - 10 = 3 \]

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old."
"To determine how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Face masks used per outing:**
   Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.

2. **Outings per day:**
   Tyrion goes out three times a day.

3. **Face masks used per day:**
   Since he changes his mask two times per outing and goes out three times a day, the number of face masks he uses per day is:
   \[
   2 \text{ masks/outing} \times 3 \text{ outings/day} = 6 \text{ masks/day}
   \]

4. **Face masks used in 2 days:**
   To find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses per day by 2:
   \[
   6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks}
   \]

Therefore, Tyrion uses \(\boxed{12}\) face masks every 2 days."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen eggs equal \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.

2. Lamar finds 5 eggs.

3. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar. So, Stacy finds \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.

4. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy. So, Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.

5. Mei finds half as many as Charlie. So, Mei finds \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei:

- Lamar: 5 eggs
- Stacy: 10 eggs
- Charlie: 8 eggs
- Mei: 4 eggs

The total number of eggs found is \(5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\) eggs.

Since Cole initially hid 36 eggs, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is \(36 - 27 = 9\).

Therefore, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of apartments in the third complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have:

\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. Therefore, the number of apartments in the third complex is:

\[ 400 + 0.60 \times 400 = 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from:

\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:

\[ 1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections} \]

He gets paid $0.40 per collection. Therefore, the total amount of money he makes in a week is:

\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1248} \]"
"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   3 \times 50 = 150 \text{ fruits}
   \]
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   7 \times 50 = 350 \text{ fruits}
   \]
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   20 \times 50 = 1000 \text{ fruits}
   \]

Next, we need to find out how many fruits the 8-year-old tree produces. According to the problem, an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits:
\[
1000 - 200 = 800 \text{ fruits}
\]

Now, we sum up the fruits produced each year:
\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2450
\]

Therefore, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:

"First, let's determine how much money Sophia gave to Jack. Sophia had $100 and gave Jack 1/5 of it. 

\[ \text{Amount given by Sophia} = \frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20 \]

Now, we add the amount given by Sophia to the amount Jack originally had:

\[ \text{Total amount Jack has now} = 100 + 20 = 120 \]

So, Jack now has $120."
"Let's define the lengths of the ropes with variables:
- Let \( R \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we can substitute the expression for \( R \) from the first relationship into the third equation:
\[ 4B + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5B + Y = 37 \]

Next, we substitute the expression for \( B \) from the second relationship into the equation above:
\[ 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5Y - 35 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we have the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
\[ B = Y - 7 \]
\[ B = 12 - 7 \]
\[ B = 5 \]

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:
\[ R = 4B \]
\[ R = 4 \times 5 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

The length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."
"First, let's determine how much money Rissa was given. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars. According to the problem, after giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, both Ronnie and Rissa gave $3 to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Initially, Ronnie had $5, and after giving $3 to his little sister, he is left with:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Given that the mural uses 12 pints of paint in total and that half of the mural is yellow, we can determine the amount of yellow paint used first. Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is:

\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

This leaves the other half of the mural to be painted with red, white, and purple paint. Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we can denote the amount of each as \( x \). Therefore, the total amount of red, white, and purple paint is:

\[ x + x + x = 3x \]

Since the total amount of paint used for red, white, and purple is the other half of the mural, it is also 6 pints. Thus, we have:

\[ 3x = 6 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{6}{3} = 2 \]

So, the amount of red paint used is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:

\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total area of the house is:

\[ \boxed{3160} \]"
"To determine the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of clouds each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.
2. **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Monday, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the number of clouds counted each day:
\[ 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 \]

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]
\[ 9 + 12 = 21 \]
\[ 21 + 24 = 45 \]
\[ 45 + 48 = 93 \]

So, the total number of clouds Alice counted from Monday to Friday is \(\boxed{93}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of pods in the special size box. The regular box contains 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods.

\[ 100 \text{ pods} + 20\% \text{ of } 100 \text{ pods} = 100 \text{ pods} + 20 \text{ pods} = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. To find the cost per pod in the special size box, we divide the total cost by the number of pods:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Since the cost per pod is $0.10, the number of pods you can get for $1 is:

\[ \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}} = 10 \text{ pods} \]

If you use 1 pod per cycle, then with $1, you can run:

\[ 10 \text{ dishwashing cycles} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills.
   \[
   \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   \[
   50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining 40 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
   \]
   The amount used to pay the bill is:
   \[
   20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   The remaining amount is:
   \[
   1000 - 400 = 600 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   The remaining number of 20 dollar bills is:
   \[
   40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas then triples his money.
   \[
   600 \times 3 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Converting to 5 Dollar Bills:**
   Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills.
   \[
   \frac{1800}{5} = 360 \text{ bills}
   \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\) goals.
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\) goals.
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\) goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To determine how many days the teacher can use the chalk before it needs to be recycled, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
   - He used 45% of the chalk on Monday.
   - Remaining chalk = 5 inches - (45% of 5 inches) = 5 inches - (0.45 * 5 inches) = 5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches.

2. **Determine the daily usage:**
   - The teacher plans to use 20% of the chalk each day.
   - Daily usage = 20% of the remaining chalk.

3. **Calculate the number of days before the chalk is recycled:**
   - The teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches.
   - We need to find out how many days it takes for the remaining chalk to fall below 2 inches.

Let's denote the remaining chalk after \( n \) days as \( C_n \).

- Initial remaining chalk \( C_0 = 2.75 \) inches.
- Daily usage = 20% of the remaining chalk.

The remaining chalk after each day can be calculated as:
\[ C_{n+1} = C_n - 0.2 \times C_n = 0.8 \times C_n \]

We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( C_n < 2 \) inches.

Let's calculate the remaining chalk for each day:

- Day 1: \( C_1 = 0.8 \times 2.75 = 2.2 \) inches.
- Day 2: \( C_2 = 0.8 \times 2.2 = 1.76 \) inches.

Since \( C_2 = 1.76 \) inches is less than 2 inches, the teacher will need to recycle the chalk on the second day.

Therefore, the teacher has \(\boxed{2}\) days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk."
"First, let's calculate the number of girls on varsity. One-third of the 12 girls are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]
So, 4 girls are on varsity.

Next, let's calculate the number of boys on varsity. One-fourth of the 12 boys are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \]
So, 3 boys are on varsity.

Now, let's find the total number of students on varsity:
\[ 4 \text{ (girls)} + 3 \text{ (boys)} = 7 \]
So, 7 students are on varsity.

The total number of students in the class is:
\[ 12 \text{ (boys)} + 12 \text{ (girls)} = 24 \]
So, there are 24 students in total.

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:
\[ 24 - 7 = 17 \]

Therefore, the number of students not on varsity is:
\[ \boxed{17} \]"

"First, let's determine how many teeth the dentist caps. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, and he drills 4 teeth. Therefore, the number of teeth capped is:

\[ 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of teeth fixed by the dentist. This includes both the teeth that were drilled and the teeth that were capped:

\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Now, we need to calculate what percentage of James' total teeth (30) this represents. The formula to calculate the percentage is:

\[ \left( \frac{\text{number of teeth fixed}}{\text{total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ 50\% \]"
"First, we need to determine how much milk Mr. Marcellus returned to the company. He purchased 4000 gallons of milk, and 2/5 of this amount had passed the expiry date.

To find 2/5 of 4000 gallons:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
\]

Mr. Marcellus returned 1600 gallons of milk. The cost per gallon of milk is $3.5. To find the total refund amount, we multiply the number of gallons returned by the cost per gallon:
\[
1600 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 1600 \times 3.5 = 5600 \text{ dollars}

"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( C \) be Colin's current age.
- Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   This can be written as:
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   This can be written as:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[
W = 5C + 35
\]

Next, substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]

Distribute the 3 on the left side:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

Rearrange the equation to isolate \( C \):
\[
75 - 35 = 5C - 3C
\]
\[
40 = 2C
\]

Solve for \( C \):
\[
C = 20
\]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

Final answer:
\[

1. **Initial Apples:**
   - Two apples fell out of the tree.
   - Newton picked up both apples and put one in his pocket, throwing the other one into the tree.

2. **First Throw:**
   - Newton threw the apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out.
   - Newton picked up these 5 apples and put all but one in his pocket, throwing the remaining one back at the tree.

3. **Second Throw:**
   - Newton threw the apple back at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out.
   - Newton picked up all of these 6 apples and went home to make a pie.

Now, let's count the apples Newton brought home:

- Initially, Newton picked up 2 apples and put 1 in his pocket, so he had 1 apple in his pocket.
- After the first throw, he picked up 5 apples and put 4 in his pocket, so he had 1 + 4 = 5 apples in his pocket.
- After the second throw, he picked up 6 apples and put all 6 in his pocket.

Therefore, the total number of apples Newton brought home is 5 (from the first throw) + 6 (from the second throw) = 11 apples.

**Final Answer:**

"To determine the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of 50 kg bags required to deliver 850 kg of coal.
2. Multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag.

First, we calculate the number of 50 kg bags needed:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the order:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's order is:
\[ \boxed{306} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices Kate's friends will eat:

Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices, and there are 6 friends, so:
\[ 6 \text{ slices/friend} \times 6 \text{ friends} = 36 \text{ cheese slices} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices they will eat:

Each friend eats 4 pepperoni pizza slices, and there are 6 friends, so:
\[ 4 \text{ slices/friend} \times 6 \text{ friends} = 24 \text{ pepperoni slices} \]

Now, we need to determine how many cheese and pepperoni pizza pies are required:

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- To find out how many cheese pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of cheese slices by the number of slices per pizza:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ cheese slices}}{12 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} \]

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- To find out how many pepperoni pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of pepperoni slices by the number of slices per pizza:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ pepperoni slices}}{8 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} \]

Therefore, Kate needs to buy a total of:
\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizza pies} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to calculate the total miles run on each day and then sum them up.

- On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So, for these three days, the total miles are \(3 \text{ miles/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles}\).
- On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So, for these two days, the total miles are \(5 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ miles}\).

Adding these totals together gives us the total miles Sam ran this week:
\[9 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 19 \text{ miles}\]

Therefore, Sam ran a total of 19 miles this week."
"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of building snowballs:**
   - Jay builds 20 snowballs in 1 hour (60 minutes).

2. **Rate of melting snowballs:**
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - In 1 hour (60 minutes), the number of 15-minute intervals is \( \frac{60}{15} = 4 \).
   - Therefore, in 1 hour, 2 snowballs melt 4 times, which means \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) snowballs melt in 1 hour.

3. **Net rate of snowball accumulation:**
   - Jay builds 20 snowballs but loses 8 snowballs due to melting.
   - Net rate of snowball accumulation = \( 20 - 8 = 12 \) snowballs per hour.

4. **Time to accumulate 60 snowballs:**
   - To find the time required to have 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net rate of accumulation.
   - Time = \( \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \).

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of years since Digimon's 20th anniversary:**
   - Since the question does not specify the current year, we can assume that the current year is the year of Digimon's 20th anniversary. Therefore, the number of years since Digimon's 20th anniversary is 20 years.

2. **Calculate John's age 20 years ago:**
   - John is currently 28 years old.
   - 20 years ago, John was \(28 - 20 = 8\) years old.

3. **Determine Jim's age 20 years ago:**
   - According to the problem, John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago.
   - If John was 8 years old, then Jim was \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) years old 20 years ago.

4. **Calculate Jim's current age:**
   - Since 20 years have passed since Jim was 4 years old, Jim is now \(4 + 20 = 24\) years old.

Therefore, Jim is currently 24 years old."
"Doxa ate 1 slice of the apple.
Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find the total number of slices they all ate, we add the slices together:
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

Therefore, they all ate a total of 6 slices of apple."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 1 bulk pack = 50
   - Bandages at the end of the first day: \(50 - 38 = 12\)

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: \(38 - 10 = 28\)
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \(12 - 28 = -16\)
   - Since they can't have a negative number of bandages, this means they needed to order more bandages to cover the deficit. They ordered enough to cover the deficit and have some left over. So, they ordered \(28 - 12 = 16\) more bandages to cover the deficit and have 50 - 16 = 34 bandages at the end of the second day.

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages ordered: 2 bulk packs = 100
   - Bandages used: \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \)
   - Bandages at the end of the third day: \(34 + 100 - 25 = 109\)

However, the problem states that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means we need to adjust our calculation to match the given information. Let's re-evaluate the bandages used and ordered:

- At the end of the second day, they had 34 bandages.
- They ordered 100 bandages on the third day.
- They used 25 bandages on the third day.
- Bandages at the end of the third day: \(34 + 100 - 25 = 109\)

Since they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, we need to find out how many bandages they started with on the first day. Let's denote the initial number of bandages as \(x\).

- After the first day: \(x + 50 - 38 = x + 12\)
- After the second day: \(x + 12 - 28 + 16 = x\)
- After the third day: \(x + 100 - 25 = x + 75\)

Since they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, we can set up the equation:
\[x + 75 = 78\]
\[x = 78 - 75\]
\[x = 3\]

So, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, calculate the cost of the haircut. The difference in hair length is 10 inches - 8 inches = 2 inches. The cost per inch of the haircut is $30, so the cost for the haircut is 2 inches * $30/inch = $60.

Next, add the cost of the color, which is $40.

Therefore, the total cost for the cut and color is $60 + $40 = $100.

The final numerical answer is:
$100"
"First, let's calculate Jen's weekly earnings from her hourly rate:

- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her weekly earnings from her hourly rate are:
\[ 7.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 6 \, \text{days/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = 45 \, \text{hours/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$67.5 \, \text{per week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her earnings from her hourly rate for April are:
\[ \$67.5 \, \text{per week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = \$270 \]

Since Jen did not incur any absences in April, she will also receive the additional $10 for complete attendance. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:
\[ \$270 + \$10 = \$280 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$280 \]"
"To calculate how much money Jason earned, we need to multiply the number of times he performed each task by the amount he earns for that task and then sum up all the amounts.

1. For emptying the dishwasher: \(6 \times \$0.50 = \$3.00\)
2. For doing his laundry: \(1 \times \$3.00 = \$3.00\)
3. For taking the trash to the curb: \(2 \times \$0.75 = \$1.50\)
4. For cleaning his room: \(1 \times \$1.50 = \$1.50\)

Now, we add all these amounts together:

\[
\$3.00 + \$3.00 + \$1.50 + \$1.50 = \$9.00
\]

So, Jason earned a total of \$9.00 in a two-week period."
"To find the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of blood in one shark.
2. Multiply that amount by ten to find the total for ten sharks.

Step 1: Each whale has 40 gallons of blood. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, we calculate the blood volume of one shark as follows:
\[ 40 \text{ gallons} \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Step 2: Now, we need to find the total amount of blood in ten sharks:
\[ 120 \text{ gallons/shark} \times 10 \text{ sharks} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:
\[ 1200 \text{ gallons} \]"
"To calculate the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up the number of people who entered at different times.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first (morning) had entered. Since 50 people came in the morning, 3 times that number is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we add all these numbers together:

\[50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320\]

Therefore, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"First, let's determine the number of red pens Alain's mom bought. Since she bought 5 packs of red pens and each pack contains 5 pens, the total number of red pens is:

\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens per pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

Next, we need to find out how many black pens were bought. According to the problem, the number of black pens is twice the number of red pens. Therefore, the total number of black pens is:

\[ 2 \times 25 \text{ red pens} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

Now, to find the total number of pens, we add the number of red pens and the number of black pens together:

\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 75 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so:

\[ \text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the cognac:

\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac to find the total amount John spends:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2400} \]"

- 20 White Oak trees.
- Twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted:
- 10 more White Oak trees than the first day, which is \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days:
- Total White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\)
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: \(40 + 50 = 90\)

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:
\[50 + 90 = 140\]

   Fred made 24 gallons of root beer on the first day.

2. **After Children's Consumption:**
   Fred's children drank 4 gallons.
   \[
   24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **After Wife's Spill:**
   Fred's wife spilled 7 gallons.
   \[
   20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **After Friend's Consumption:**

"First, let's determine how many fish have red stripes. One-third of the 66 fish have red stripes:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

So, 22 fish have red stripes. Now, we need to find out how many fish are left after removing the fish with red stripes:

\[
66 - 22 = 44
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 44 fish have blue stripes. According to the problem, 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes:

\[
\frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

So, 20 fish have blue stripes. To find the total number of fish that have either red stripes or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[
22 + 20 = 42
\]

Therefore, the total number of fish that have red stripes and blue stripes is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Eyeshadow Colors:**
   - Amy had two eyeshadow palettes, each with 4 colors.
     \[
     2 \text{ palettes} \times 4 \text{ colors per palette} = 8 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - Amy also had three makeup sets, each with 6 colors.
     \[
     3 \text{ sets} \times 6 \text{ colors per set} = 18 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - Total initial eyeshadow colors:
     \[
     8 \text{ colors from palettes} + 18 \text{ colors from sets} = 26 \text{ colors}
     \]

2. **After Her Sister Steals One Palette:**
   - One palette is stolen, which had 4 colors.
     \[
     26 \text{ colors} - 4 \text{ colors} = 22 \text{ colors}
     \]

3. **Amy Uses Up Half of the Colors from One Makeup Set:**
   - One makeup set has 6 colors, and Amy uses up half of them.
     \[
     \frac{6 \text{ colors}}{2} = 3 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - After using up 3 colors from one set, the remaining colors from that set are:
     \[
     6 \text{ colors} - 3 \text{ colors} = 3 \text{ colors}

"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Mattison's height = 60 inches.
2. His house is 7 times as high as he is.
3. The first floor's ceiling height is 3 times his height.

Now, let's calculate each part:

1. Height of the house = 7 * Mattison's height = 7 * 60 inches = 420 inches.
2. Height of the first floor's ceiling = 3 * Mattison's height = 3 * 60 inches = 180 inches.

To find the height from the second floor's floor to the roof, we need to subtract the height of the first floor's ceiling from the total height of the house:

Height from the second floor's floor to the roof = Total height of the house - Height of the first floor's ceiling
= 420 inches - 180 inches
= 240 inches.

Therefore, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is 240 inches."
"First, let's determine how many shells team Alphas found. Since they found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

This means team Alphas found 280 shells. Now, we need to find out how many shells were left for the other two teams after team Alphas found their share:

\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Next, we calculate how many shells team The finders found. They found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

So, team The finders found 252 shells. To find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the number of shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells after team Alphas found their share:

\[ 420 - 252 = 168 \]

\[ \text{The number of shells found by team Gogetters is } 168. \]"
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

First, let's calculate the total miles walked by all four dogs based on the average:
- The average miles walked per day by the four dogs is 3 miles.
- Therefore, the total miles walked by all four dogs in a day is \(3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles}\).

Next, we know the miles walked by the first three dogs:
- The first dog walks 1 mile.
- The second dog walks 4 miles.
- The third dog walks 3 miles.

Adding these up gives:
\[1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}\]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs:
\[12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles}\]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day."
"First, we calculate the amount of the loan John gets by taking 40% of the value of his house:

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, we determine how much of the loan John uses to pay off his debts by taking 60% of the loan amount:

\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Finally, we find out how much money John has leftover after paying his debts:

\[ \text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

Therefore, the amount of money John had leftover after paying his debts is:

\[ \boxed{40000} \]"

The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms, the second tuna weighs 46 kilograms, and the third tuna weighs 26 kilograms. Adding these weights together:

\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings from selling 128 kilograms of tuna at a rate of $0.50 per kilogram:

\[ 128 \times 0.50 = 64 \]

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To calculate Trinity's profit, we first need to determine the selling price of the magazines. She sells them at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. Given that she bought the magazines at $72, we can calculate the selling price as follows:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times 1.375 \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the buying price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."

"First, let's determine the capacity of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has the capacity of \( \frac{1}{8} \) of Ali's class, and Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, we can calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[ \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:

\[ \text{Total capacity of John's school} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students} \]

The capacity of Ali's class is 120 students. Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is:

\[ \text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 150 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen owes his sister, including the 2% interest on the $300.

The interest is calculated as:
\[ 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen owes is:
\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 each month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in 11 months is:
\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he has already paid from the total amount he owes:
\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of diaper changes needed per day for both children. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day and there are 2 children:

\[ 5 \text{ changes/child/day} \times 2 \text{ children} = 10 \text{ changes/day} \]

Jordan's wife changes half of these diaper changes. Therefore, she changes:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes} \]

Since Jordan changes the other half, the number of diaper changes Jordan does per day is also:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes} \]

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{Base area} \times \text{Height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume for packing jelly beans:**
   Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume is:
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar:**
   Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{\text{Effective volume}}{\text{Volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880
   \]

4. **Estimate the number of red jelly beans:**
   Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.
   \[
   \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864
   \]

5. **Determine how far off Tim's guess was:**
   The true number of red jelly beans is 900.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36
   \]

**Final Answer:**
Tim was 36 jelly beans off."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of people on the bus**: 20
2. **People entering at the first stop**: 40
   - Total number of people on the bus after the first stop: \(20 + 40 = 60\)
3. **People entering at the second stop**: \(\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30\)
   - Total number of people on the bus after the second stop: \(60 + 30 = 90\)
4. **People entering at the third stop**: The number of passengers on the bus doubled, so \(90 \times 2 = 180\)
   - Total number of people on the bus after the third stop: \(180\)

Now, we need to find out how many more people are required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus. The bus has a capacity of 200 people.

- Remaining spaces on the bus: \(200 - 180 = 20\)

Therefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of visits Pauline made to the museum over the 8 years.

Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year. Over 5 years, she made:
\[ 3 \text{ visits/year} \times 5 \text{ years} = 15 \text{ visits} \]

For the next 3 years, she continued to visit 3 times a year:
\[ 3 \text{ visits/year} \times 3 \text{ years} = 9 \text{ visits} \]

So, the total number of visits over 8 years is:
\[ 15 \text{ visits} + 9 \text{ visits} = 24 \text{ visits} \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of one visit after the increase. The original cost of one visit is $2. The cost increased by 150%, which means the new cost is:
\[ 2 + (150\% \times 2) = 2 + (1.5 \times 2) = 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount Pauline spent on all 24 visits at the new cost of $5 per visit:
\[ 24 \text{ visits} \times 5 \text{ dollars/visit} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students who can try the escape room.
2. Determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed.
3. Calculate the total time required for all groups to try the escape room.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of students who can try the escape room.**

There are 10 students in each of the 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th) who can try the escape room. Therefore, the total number of students is:
\[ 10 \text{ students/grade} \times 4 \text{ grades} = 40 \text{ students} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed.**

To find out how many groups of 8 students can be formed from 40 students, we divide the total number of students by the group size:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students/group}} = 5 \text{ groups} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total time required for all groups to try the escape room.**

Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room. Since there are 5 groups, the total time required is:
\[ 5 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 225 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take \(\boxed{225}\) minutes for everyone to try the escape room."
"To determine how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the wooden tables and the roof frames separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost of the wooden tables:
- John manufactured 4 wooden tables.
- Each wooden table costs $20.
- Therefore, the total cost for the wooden tables is \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the roof frames:
- John manufactured 2 roof frames.
- Each roof frame costs $10.
- Therefore, the total cost for the roof frames is \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs of the wooden tables and the roof frames to find the total amount Ali has to pay:
- Total cost for wooden tables: $80
- Total cost for roof frames: $20
- Therefore, the total amount Ali has to pay is \( 80 + 20 = 100 \) dollars.

Final numerical answer:

"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we calculate:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is \(\boxed{32}\) feet."

\[ 2 \times 175 = 350 \text{ inches} \]

So, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two segments: the first 16 minutes and the remaining minutes.

1. **Cost for the first 16 minutes:**
   - The rate is $0.25 per minute.
   - Cost for 16 minutes = 16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

2. **Cost for the remaining minutes:**
   - Total call duration is 36 minutes.
   - Minutes beyond the first 16 = 36 minutes - 16 minutes = 20 minutes.
   - The rate drops to $0.20 per minute after 16 minutes.
   - Cost for 20 minutes = 20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00

3. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost for the first 16 minutes + Cost for the remaining 20 minutes
   - Total cost = $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

The total cost for a 36-minute call is $8.00."

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly makes as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be written as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

Each of the five people in the class gets two treats, so the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made \(\boxed{3}\) cupcakes."

"First, let's calculate the amount Charlie earns from the 4 lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour.

\[ 4 \text{ lessons} \times \$80 \text{ per lesson} = \$320 \]

Next, we need to determine the reduced rate for lessons with a veteran. Since the rate is reduced by 25%, we calculate 75% of the standard rate.

\[ 75\% \text{ of } \$80 = 0.75 \times \$80 = \$60 \]

Now, we calculate the amount Charlie earns from the 2 lessons with a veteran at the reduced rate.

\[ 2 \text{ lessons} \times \$60 \text{ per lesson} = \$120 \]

Finally, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make for the day.

\[ \$320 + \$120 = \$440 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is \(\boxed{440}\) dollars."

\]
So, Eve is left with 5 pomelos.

To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number:
\[
20 - 5 = 15
\]

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos."
"First, let's calculate how many apples Walter ate. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 apples:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, Walter ate 24 apples. This means he had:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Next, Walter gave 25% of the remaining 36 apples to his sister. To find out how many apples that is, we calculate 25% of 36:

\[ 0.25 \times 36 = 9 \]

So, Walter gave 9 apples to his sister. This leaves him with:

\[ 36 - 9 = 27 \]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. The total amount of money he received is:

\[ 27 \times 3 = 81 \]

"To find out how many novels Regina has written this year, we can set up the problem using the information given.

Let \( x \) be the number of novels Regina has written this year. According to the problem, 9 novels represent 3 quarters (or \(\frac{3}{4}\)) of the number of novels she has written this year. This can be written as:

\[
9 = \frac{3}{4}x
\]

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \). We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):

\[
9 \times \frac{4}{3} = x
\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[
9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 3 \times 4 = 12
\]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

"To determine the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days. Michael travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr. Assuming he drives for 24 hours each day (excluding stops), the distance he covers each day is:

\[ 50 \, \text{km/hr} \times 24 \, \text{hr/day} = 1200 \, \text{km/day} \]

Over 3 days, the total distance he covers is:

\[ 1200 \, \text{km/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3600 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas (6000 km) Michael has covered. The percentage is calculated as follows:

\[ \left( \frac{3600 \, \text{km}}{6000 \, \text{km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

"First, let's determine how many grapes Madeline's brother used to make the grape juice. Since he used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, and Madeline ate 6 grapes, we calculate:

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many grapes were used to make the pies. Since the pie recipe calls for 12 grapes per pie and their mother made 4 pies, we calculate:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

Now, we can find the total number of grapes used by adding the grapes used for the grape juice and the grapes used for the pies:

\[ 30 + 48 = 78 \text{ grapes} \]

Since these are the only grapes used, the total number of grapes at the beginning must be equal to the number of grapes used. Therefore, the total number of grapes at the beginning is:

\[ \boxed{78} \]"
"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of teachers who were not sick.

"First, let's break down the costs Bud incurs for making macaroni and cheese each week:

1. **Pasta cost**: $1.00 per box.
2. **Cheddar cheese cost**: $3.00.
3. **Gruyere cheese cost**: Twice the amount spent on cheddar cheese, which is \(2 \times 3 = $6.00\).

Now, let's calculate the total weekly cost:
\[ \text{Total weekly cost} = \text{Pasta cost} + \text{Cheddar cheese cost} + \text{Gruyere cheese cost} \]
\[ \text{Total weekly cost} = 1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00 \]

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, we need to find out how much he spends in one year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:
\[ \text{Total yearly cost} = \text{Total weekly cost} \times 52 \]
\[ \text{Total yearly cost} = 10.00 \times 52 = 520.00 \]

Therefore, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year."
"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes to clean one classroom, the total time required is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many minutes the custodian works in a day. Since they work an 8-hour day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total working time in a day is:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to clean all the classrooms. Since the custodian has 5 days to clean the school, we can calculate the total time available over these 5 days:

\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 480 \text{ minutes/day} = 2400 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 1200 minutes are required to clean all the classrooms and the custodian has 2400 minutes available over 5 days, we can see that the custodian has enough time to clean all the classrooms within the given timeframe. Now, we need to find out what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning classrooms. The time spent cleaning per day is the total time required divided by the number of days:

\[ \frac{1200 \text{ minutes}}{5 \text{ days}} = 240 \text{ minutes/day} \]

To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning, we use the formula:

\[ \left( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{480 \text{ minutes}} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage of their day, on average, that is spent cleaning classrooms is:

\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"
"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:

- The middle 2 shelves together can hold \(10 + 10 = 20\) books.
- Adding the bottom and top shelves, the total capacity of one bookcase is \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

**Final Answer: 2**"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs, and the cost per dozen is $2.40. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \text{ dozens} \times \$2.40 \text{ per dozen} = \$12.00 \]

Next, let's determine the selling price per egg. Rose sells the eggs for $1 for 3 eggs. Therefore, the price per egg is:
\[ \frac{\$1}{3 \text{ eggs}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ dollars per egg} \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the eggs. Rose has 5 dozens of eggs, which is:
\[ 5 \text{ dozens} \times 12 \text{ eggs per dozen} = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

The total revenue from selling 60 eggs at \(\frac{1}{3}\) dollars per egg is:
\[ 60 \text{ eggs} \times \frac{1}{3} \text{ dollars per egg} = \$20.00 \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \$20.00 - \$12.00 = \$8.00 \]

Therefore, Rose's profit is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of red hats. Since half of the hats are red, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hats are left after removing the red hats:

\[ \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Out of these remaining hats, \( \frac{3}{5} \) are blue. So, the number of blue hats is:

\[ \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

The rest of the hats are white. To find the number of white hats, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats:

\[ \text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of white hats Skyler has is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the beef jerky after the discount. The original price is $18.00 per bag, and there is a $3.00 discount, so the price per bag after the discount is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per stick of beef jerky. Since there are 30 sticks in a bag and the bag now costs $15.00, the cost per stick is:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.50 to cents:

\[ 0.50 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost per stick of jerky is:

\[ 50 \text{ cents} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass, which is 70% of the total questions from both tests.

The first test has 70 questions, and she needs to get 60% of them correct:
\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \text{ questions correct} \]

The second test has 40 questions. Let's denote the number of questions she needs to get correct on the second test as \( x \).

The total number of questions from both tests is:
\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

To pass, Audrey needs to get 70% of these 110 questions correct:
\[ 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \text{ questions correct} \]

Since she already got 42 questions correct from the first test, the number of questions she needs to get correct on the second test is:
\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

Final numerical answer:

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes Mary makes as \( S \). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes she makes is \( 5S - 4 \).

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry cubes and the blueberry cubes, which is given as 116. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Next, we solve for \( S \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, add 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Then, divide both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. Now, we need to find the number of blueberry cubes, which is \( 5S - 4 \):
\[ 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \(\boxed{96}\)."

"To solve this problem, let's break down the time taken for each side of the Rubik's cube:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice the time of the first side, so each takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. The last two sides each take half the time of the first side, so each takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.
4. The sixth side (which is the fifth side mentioned in the problem) is not specified, but since the problem states ""once you get the 5th side you have all 6 sides,"" we can assume the sixth side also takes the same time as the fifth side, which is 2.5 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all six sides:

\[
5 \text{ (first side)} + 10 \text{ (second side)} + 10 \text{ (third side)} + 2.5 \text{ (fourth side)} + 2.5 \text{ (fifth side)} + 2.5 \text{ (sixth side)}
\]

\[
5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 32.5 \text{ minutes}

"Let's break down the popping process step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds**: 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate triples, so \(20 \times 3 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Following 30 seconds**: The popping rate quadruples, so \(20 \times 4 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds**: The popping rate is halved from the previous 30 seconds, so \(80 \div 2 = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, let's sum the number of kernels that popped in the first four 30-second intervals:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\]

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop. So, a quarter of 40 kernels pop:
\[40 \div 4 = 10\]

Adding these to the total number of popped kernels:
\[200 + 10 = 210\]

Therefore, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:

"First, we need to calculate the total weight of the car, luggage, and children. The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and each child weighs 75 pounds. Since there are two children, the total weight of the children is \(75 \times 2 = 150\) pounds.

Adding these together, the total weight is:
\[1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 \text{ pounds}\]

Next, we need to find 1% of the total weight to determine the force required to move the car. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we calculate:
\[1600 \times \frac{1}{100} = 16 \text{ pounds}\]

Therefore, the force John needs to push the car is:
\[16 \text{ pounds}\]

Final numerical answer:
\[16\]"
"To determine how many feet of crepe paper James needs to buy, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular backyard fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the fence:
- Length = 20 feet
- Width = 15 feet

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (20 + 15) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 35 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

Therefore, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper.

"To find the average of Mia and Emma's ages, we first need to determine Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart in age, Emma must be 40 + 16 = 56 years old.

Now, to find the average of their ages, we add their ages together and divide by 2:

\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Mia's age} + \text{Emma's age}}{2} = \frac{40 + 56}{2} = \frac{96}{2} = 48
\]

The average of their ages is 48."
"To find the total number of good seashells that Tom, Nancy, and Benny found together, we first need to calculate the total number of seashells they found and then subtract the number of cracked seashells.

1. Calculate the total number of seashells found:
   - Tom found 214 seashells.
   - Nancy found 432 seashells.
   - Benny found 86 seashells.
   - Total seashells = 214 + 432 + 86 = 732 seashells.

Therefore, it took Anna 7 hours to finish the puzzle.

7 hours"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of feed consumed by Dexter's pigs in a day.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day. Therefore, each pig eats:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Dexter has 5 pigs, so the total feed consumption per day for all pigs is:
\[ 8 \text{ pounds/day/pig} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total feed consumption over a week (7 days):
\[ 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. After a week, the amount of feed left is:
\[ 300 \text{ pounds} - 280 \text{ pounds} = 20 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the number of pounds of feed left after a week is:

"To determine how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals she has.

First, let's add up the meals given out over the three days:
- Meals given out on Friday: 64
- Meals given out on Saturday: 30
- Meals given out on Sunday: 48

Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48

Now, let's perform the addition:
64 + 30 = 94
94 + 48 = 142

So, Mamou has given out 142 meals in total.

"To determine the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of the honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the total cost of ingredients for one jar and then for 10 jars. After that, we'll subtract the total cost from the total revenue from selling 10 jars.

First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound = 2 * $6 = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound = 1.5 * $8 = $12
- Special honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = 2 * $10 = $20

Total cost for one jar = $12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44

Now, calculate the total cost for 10 jars:
Total cost for 10 jars = 10 * $44 = $440

Next, calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars:
Total revenue = 10 * $50 = $500

Finally, calculate the profit:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $500 - $440 = $60

Therefore, the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars is $60."

"First, let's calculate the total number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many holes Nate can fill in a day. Nate fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes each night, so the net number of holes filled each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/night} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes for Nate to fill all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

Therefore, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes."
"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School, and Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = 4000 \times \frac{3}{4} \]

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = 4000 \times 0.75 \]

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = 3000 \]

Now, to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract the average enrollment of Butler High School from that of Norman High School:

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 4000 - 3000 \]

3. **Let \( x \) be the number of beakers Igor gathered.**
   - Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers.
   - Igor lost some beakers on the way, so the number of beakers he placed on the lab bench is \( x \).

4. **Set up the equation for the total number of items on the lab bench:**
   - The total number of items on the lab bench is the sum of the test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes.
   - According to the problem, the total number of items is 29.
   - Therefore, the equation is:
     \[
     8 \text{ (test tubes)} + x \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29
     \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   8 + x + 16 = 29
   \]
   \[
   24 + x = 29
   \]
   \[
   x = 29 - 24
   \]
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

6. **Determine the number of beakers Igor lost:**
   - Igor was supposed to gather 7 beakers but only placed 5 on the lab bench.
   - Therefore, the number of beakers he lost is:
     \[
     7 - 5 = 2
     \]

**Final Answer:**
Igor lost 2 beakers."
"First, let's calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg requires 2 screws. Therefore, the number of screws needed per table is:
\[ 4 \text{ legs/table} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table} \]

James is putting together 4 tables, so the total number of screws needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the number of screws used from the total number of screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Therefore, the number of screws James will have left over is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"There are 10 eggs in the first basket. The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, which means it has \(10 \times 2 = 20\) eggs. 

To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket: \(10 + 20 = 30\).

Therefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets put together is 30."
"First, let's determine how much each person raised:

1. Alexandra raises $430.
2. Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.
3. Sarah raises $300.
4. Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add up the amounts raised by all four girls:

- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: $750
- Maryam: $700
- Sarah: $300

Total amount raised = $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180.

Therefore, the total amount of money they all raised is $2180."
"First, let's determine the speed of Aaron and Vanessa.

Given:
- Vanessa ran 4 miles.
- Aaron ran half the distance Vanessa ran, so Aaron ran \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.
- Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.

From this, we can calculate Aaron's speed:
\[ \text{Aaron's speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is:
\[ \text{Vanessa's speed} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \times 2 = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we can calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:
\[ \text{Time for Vanessa} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}}} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her part of the race."
"To determine how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line needed based on the length of the dock.
2. Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total needed.

First, the caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Since there are 200 feet of dock, the total amount of line needed is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we subtract the 6 feet of new line he already has from the total amount needed:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy a total of:
\[ \boxed{594} \text{ feet of line} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the meals and wine for one night:

- They order 2 meals at $5 each, so the cost for the meals is \(2 \times 5 = \$10\).
- They also order a $5 bottle of wine.

So, the total cost for one night is \(10 + 5 = \$15\).

Since they are open 2 days a week, the total cost for the week is \(15 \times 2 = \$30\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\$30
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost price per watermelon. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = \$1.60 \]

Next, we need to find the selling price per watermelon, given that the vendor made a profit of 25%. The profit percentage is calculated on the cost price, so the selling price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = \text{Cost price per watermelon} \times (1 + \text{Profit percentage}) \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times (1 + 0.25) \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 1.25 \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00."
"First, let's determine Dora's current age. If Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, she is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

Next, we know that James is twice as old as Dora. Therefore, James is currently \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

Now, we need to find out how old John was when James was born. Since James is currently 18 years old, and John had James when he was 19, John is currently \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

The youngest son was born when John was 32. Therefore, the youngest son is currently \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

Final answer:
8"
"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour:**
   - Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour:**
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
     \]

3. **Find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:**
   - Ana peels 20 oranges.
   - Jane peels 15 oranges.
   - The difference is:
     \[
     20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges}
     \]

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and he gets it at 80% off. 

The discount amount is:
\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

So, the cost of the radiator after the discount is:
\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. Therefore, the total cost for the mechanic's work is:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's work to find the total amount Mark paid:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of equations. Let's define:
- \( C \) as the number of chickens.
- \( K \) as the number of cows.

We know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ C + K = 20 \]

From the second piece of information, we know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, so we can write the equation:
\[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To find \( C \) and \( K \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of pizza slices available. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many people are sharing the pizzas. Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people. To find out how many slices each person can have, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices of pizza."
