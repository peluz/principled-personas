"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Janet has each day, which is 16.

Next, we subtract the eggs she uses for her own consumption and for baking:
- She eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
- She uses 4 eggs for baking muffins for her friends.

So, the total number of eggs used is \(3 + 4 = 7\).

Now, we subtract the eggs used from the total number of eggs:
\[16 - 7 = 9\]

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. Therefore, the total amount she makes from selling the eggs is:
\[9 \times 2 = 18\]

So, Janet makes \(\boxed{18}\) dollars every day at the farmers' market."
"The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount in white fiber. Half of 2 bolts is 1 bolt. Therefore, the total amount of bolts needed is 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

"First, let's calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. An increase of 150% on $80,000 is calculated as follows:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house after the repairs is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost Josh incurred, which includes the purchase price and the repair costs:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, Josh made a profit of:
\[ \boxed{70,000} \]"
"James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. He does this 3 times a week. 

First, calculate the total distance he runs in one session:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints/session} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters/session} \]

Next, calculate the total distance he runs in a week:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

So, the total meters James runs in a week is:
\[ 540 \text{ meters} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of feed Wendi's chickens need in a day. Since each chicken needs 3 cups of feed and there are 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:

\[ 3 \text{ cups/chicken} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we know that Wendi gives 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. So, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:

\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:

\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"To calculate the total cost for Kylar, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

Let's break it down:

1. **Cost of the first glass:** $5
2. **Cost of the second glass:** 60% of $5 = $3
3. **Cost of the third glass:** $5
4. **Cost of the fourth glass:** $3
5. **And so on...**

Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, we can see that the pattern repeats every two glasses. Therefore, we can calculate the total cost by summing up the cost of 8 pairs of glasses.

Each pair of glasses costs:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Since there are 8 pairs:
\[ 8 \text{ pairs} \times 8 \text{ dollars per pair} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"Given that Seattle has 20 sheep, we can determine the number of sheep in Charleston and Toulouse based on the relationships provided.

1. **Seattle's Sheep**: 20 sheep.
2. **Charleston's Sheep**: Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Charleston's Sheep} = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]
3. **Toulouse's Sheep**: Since Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Toulouse's Sheep} = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

Now, to find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together, we add the number of sheep in each city:
\[
\text{Total Sheep} = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260
\]

**Final Answer**: 260"
"First, let's calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the file without any interruptions:

- 40% of 200 GB is \( 200 \times 0.40 = 80 \) GB.
- At a rate of 2 GB/minute, it takes \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes to download 80 GB.

Next, we account for the 20-minute restart due to Windows updates:

- Total time so far: \( 40 \) minutes (download) + \( 20 \) minutes (restart) = \( 60 \) minutes.

After the restart, Carla has to start downloading the entire 200 GB file again from the beginning. The time to download the remaining 120 GB (200 GB - 80 GB) is:

- \( \frac{120}{2} = 60 \) minutes.

Adding the time for the initial 80 GB download, the 20-minute restart, and the final 120 GB download:

- Total time: \( 40 \) minutes + \( 20 \) minutes + \( 60 \) minutes = \( 120 \) minutes.

Therefore, the total time to download the file is 120 minutes."
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he has traveled and then subtract the distance he has covered towards getting home.

1. **Initial Drive:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - Standstill Traffic: 2 hours (no distance covered).
   - Driving at 30 mph for 0.5 hours: Distance = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - Driving at 80 mph for the remaining 1.5 hours: Distance = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Covered on the Return Trip:**
   - Total distance = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - Initial distance from home = 180 miles.
   - Distance covered towards home = 135 miles.
   - Distance remaining = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

**Final Answer:**
John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours."
"First, calculate Eliza's regular earnings for the first 40 hours:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

Next, calculate her overtime hours:
\[ 45 \text{ hours} - 40 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Determine her overtime pay rate:
\[ 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]

Calculate her earnings for the 5 overtime hours:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Finally, add her regular earnings and overtime earnings to find her total earnings for the week:
\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are:
\[ \$460 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of downloads in the second month. Since it was three times the number of the first month, we have:

\[ \text{Second month downloads} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \]

Next, we need to find out how many downloads there were in the third month. The downloads in the third month were reduced by 30% from the second month. So, we first calculate 30% of 180:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 180 = 0.30 \times 180 = 54 \]

Then, we subtract this from the second month's downloads to find the third month's downloads:

\[ \text{Third month downloads} = 180 - 54 = 126 \]

Now, we sum up the downloads from all three months to get the total:

\[ \text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

So, the total number of downloads over the three months is:

\[ 366 \]"
"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = \( 3 \times 68 = 204 \) dollars.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \) dollars.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = \( 6 \times 55 = 330 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up the total costs for each type of pastry to get the final total cost:

\[
204 + 160 + 330 = 694
\]

**Final total cost:** 694 dollars."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the break-even point. This is the point where the total revenue from selling lemons equals the total costs (initial planting cost plus annual costs).

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Initial Cost:**
   - Cost to plant the tree: $90

2. **Annual Costs:**
   - Cost to water and feed the tree: $3 per year

3. **Annual Revenue:**
   - Number of lemons grown per year: 7
   - Selling price per lemon: $1.5
   - Annual revenue: \( 7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5 \text{ per year} \)

4. **Net Annual Profit:**
   - Net annual profit: \( \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5 \text{ per year} \)

5. **Break-Even Point:**
   - To find the break-even point, we need to determine how many years it will take for the net annual profit to cover the initial cost.
   - Break-even point (in years) = Initial cost / Net annual profit
   - Break-even point = \( \frac{\$90}{\$7.5 \text{ per year}} = 12 \text{ years} \)

### Final Answer:
It will take 12 years before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree."
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there. Therefore, she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house, and she was left with \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners.

4. According to the problem, after all these sales, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

5. To solve for \( x \), first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]

6. Add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]

7. Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]

8. Finally, divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

\[
\boxed{18}

"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we find out how many students are left after accounting for those who enrolled in contemporary dance:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Of these remaining 16 students, 25% enrolled in jazz dance. So, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Now, we find out how many students are left to enroll in hip-hop dance:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the following calculation:

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.60 \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

\[ 60\% \]"
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the profit from each purchase based on the speculated market increases.

1. **Jewelry Calculation:**
   - Initial value of jewelry: $5,000
   - Speculated increase: 2.5%
   - Profit from jewelry = Initial value * Speculated increase
   - Profit from jewelry = $5,000 * 2.5% = $5,000 * 0.025 = $125

2. **Electronic Gadgets Calculation:**
   - Initial value of electronic gadgets: $8,000
   - Speculated increase: 1.2%
   - Profit from electronic gadgets = Initial value * Speculated increase
   - Profit from electronic gadgets = $8,000 * 1.2% = $8,000 * 0.012 = $96

Comparing the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing the jewelry, which would yield a profit of $125.

**Final numerical answer:**
$125"
"Each train travels 80 miles westward and then 150 miles northward over the two days. 

To find the total distance covered by each train, we simply add the distances together:

\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to break down her earnings from both her teaching and coaching jobs.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She earns $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
\[ 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} = 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- She earns $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
\[ 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours/week} = 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from coaching are:
\[ 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Finally, to find her total annual salary, we add her earnings from teaching and coaching:
\[ 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} + 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} = 57500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is:
\[ 57500 \, \text{dollars} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Claire eats in a week. Since she makes a 3 egg omelet every morning, and there are 7 days in a week, she eats:

\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of eggs she eats in 4 weeks:

\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, to convert the total number of eggs into dozens, we divide by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12 eggs):

\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks."
"First, let's calculate the total time Marissa has to complete the hike to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles. To find the total time required to hike at an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 2 hours (1 hour for the first 4 miles and another hour for the next 2 miles) on the trail. Therefore, the remaining time she has to complete the hike is:

\[ \text{Remaining time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance to be covered is:

\[ \text{Remaining distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

\[ \text{Required speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour."
"First, let's calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink before any is spilled. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the orange drink is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters} \]

After spilling one liter of the orange drink, the remaining volume of the orange drink is:

\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters} \]

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the water from both the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink to find the total amount of water in the 24 liters of mixed drink:

\[ 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Raymond's current age.
2. Determine the age of Raymond's son when he was born.
3. Calculate the number of years ago Raymond's son was born based on Samantha's current age.

First, since Samantha is currently 31 years old and Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond's current age is:
\[ 31 - 6 = 25 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we know that Raymond had his son at the age of 23. Therefore, the age of Raymond's son when he was born is 23 years before Raymond's current age:
\[ 25 - 23 = 2 \text{ years old} \]

This means Raymond's son was born 2 years ago. Therefore, the number of years ago Raymond's son was born is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Billy sold DVDs to his first 3 customers, each buying 1 DVD, which totals 3 DVDs. Then, he sold DVDs to his next 2 customers, each buying 2 DVDs, which totals 4 DVDs. The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs. 

So, the total number of DVDs sold is 3 (from the first 3 customers) + 4 (from the next 2 customers) = 7 DVDs.

Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday."
"The candle burns for 4 hours from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Since it melts by 2 centimeters every hour, the total reduction in length is:

\[ 2 \, \text{cm/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 8 \, \text{cm} \]

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM."
"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that the price Kyle paid ($19.50) is 75% of the original price (since he got a 25% discount).

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

Given that \( 75\% \) of \( P \) is $19.50, we can write the equation as:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's calculate the value:
\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we first need to calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples.

1. **Chicken meal cost**: $12
2. **Cost of 5 packs of milk**: \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars
3. **Cost of 4 apples**: \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars

Adding these together gives the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars

Marie paid a total of $50. Therefore, the amount spent on pizza is:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is:
\[\frac{17}{8.50} = 2\]

So, Marie ordered \(\boxed{2}\) boxes of pizza."
"To find out how much Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the total cost for each type of item and then sum these amounts.

1. **Cost of shorts:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
   - Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
   - Total cost for shorts = \( 3 \times 16.50 = 49.50 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of pants:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
   - Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
   - Total cost for pants = \( 3 \times 22.50 = 67.50 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of shoes:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
   - Each pair of shoes costs $42.
   - Total cost for shoes = \( 3 \times 42 = 126 \) dollars.

Now, we sum the total costs for all the items:
\[ 49.50 + 67.50 + 126 = 243 \]

Therefore, Mishka spent a total of \( \boxed{243} \) dollars on all the clothing items."
"First, we need to determine how many servings of ice cream Cynthia consumes in 60 days. Since she eats one serving every night, in 60 days she will consume:

\[ 60 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ serving/day} = 60 \text{ servings} \]

Next, we need to find out how many cartons of ice cream she will need. Each carton contains 15 servings, so the number of cartons required is:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Since each carton costs $4.00, the total cost for 4 cartons is:

\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00/\text{carton} = \$16.00 \]

Therefore, after 60 days, Cynthia will spend:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between these two points on his trip.

1. Henry's first stop was after 20 miles.
2. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip. This means he stopped at the 45th mile (since 60 - 15 = 45).

Now, to find the distance between his first and second stops, we subtract the mile marker of the first stop from the mile marker of the second stop:

45 miles (second stop) - 20 miles (first stop) = 25 miles

Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

25 miles"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

The cost of the first pair of high heels is given as $33. The second pair of high heels costs twice as much as the first pair, so it costs \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

Together, the two pairs of high heels cost \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the boots cost \( \boxed{104} \) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we start by defining the variables for Darrell and Allen's current ages. Let Darrell's current age be \(7x\) and Allen's current age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

Given that the sum of their ages is 162, we can write the equation:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

Solving for \(x\), we divide both sides by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we can find Allen's current age by substituting \(x = 9\) into the expression for Allen's age:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"First, let's determine the guesses of each friend:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we sum these guesses and divide by the number of guesses:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

The average guess is 80."
"To find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the daily care time for all dogs.
2. Multiply the daily care time by the number of days in a week.

First, we know that each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. Since John takes care of 10 dogs, the total daily care time is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours he spends in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs."
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( G \) be the number of gold coins.
- Let \( S \) be the number of silver coins.

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:
1. \( G + S = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

**Final Answer:**
70"
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Raymond has 40 jewels. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Then, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, we subtract 2 from this number to find out how many jewels Siobhan has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points that is, we calculate 25% of 4 points:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \text{ point} \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:

\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Adding the points from both halves of the game:

\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \text{ points} \]

**Total points scored: 9**"
"First, let's determine how many yogurts Terry consumes in 30 days. Since Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, over 30 days he will consume:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of yogurts by 4:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, Terry spends \(\boxed{75}\) dollars on yogurt over 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his lego sets. He sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount is:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost is:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, John has $5 left. This means the money he spent on the video games plus the $5 left equals the total money he had from selling the lego sets. We can confirm this by subtracting the money spent on video games and the leftover money from the total money he had:
\[ 195 - 160 - 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Since John has no more lego sets left to sell and the problem does not mention any additional purchases or sales, the number of lego sets he still has is:
\[ 0 \]

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find the average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   - John runs 3 hours on the first day.
   - Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour.
   - Distance on the first day = \( 3v \) miles.

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   - On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day.
   - Distance on each of these days = \( \frac{3v}{2} \) miles.
   - Total distance for the other two days = \( 2 \times \frac{3v}{2} = 3v \) miles.

3. **Total weekly distance:**
   - Total distance run in a week = Distance on the first day + Distance on the other two days.
   - Total distance = \( 3v + 3v = 6v \) miles.
   - We know the total weekly distance is 60 miles.
   - Therefore, \( 6v = 60 \).

4. **Solving for \( v \):**
   - \( v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \) miles per hour.

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour."
"First, let's determine Dana's running and walking speeds based on her skipping speed.

Given:
- Dana's skipping speed = 3 miles per hour.
- Skipping speed is half as fast as running speed.

So, if \( S \) is the running speed, then:
\[ S = 2 \times \text{skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, since running speed is four times the walking speed:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{\text{running speed}}{4} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we need to calculate the time spent running and walking. Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking in a six-hour period.

Time spent running:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Time spent walking:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled during each activity.

Distance traveled running:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{speed} \times \text{time} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Distance traveled walking:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{speed} \times \text{time} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, the total distance traveled in six hours is the sum of the distances traveled running and walking:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"If Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben’s iPhone is two times older than Suzy’s, then Ben’s iPhone is \(1 \times 2 = 2\) years old.

Since Brandon’s iPhone is four times as old as Ben’s, Brandon’s iPhone is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) years old.

Therefore, Brandon’s iPhone is 8 years old."
"When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the gold javelin three times farther than her normal throwing distance. Her normal throwing distance is 400 feet. Therefore, with the gemstone, she can throw the javelin:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin."
"First, we calculate the total number of pie pieces available initially. Since Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the initial total:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

\[ 26 \]"
"First, let's determine how many calories you have left to consume from your daily target of 2000 calories after you've already consumed 1800 calories.

\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many servings of chips you can consume with the remaining 200 calories. Since each serving of chips contains 250 calories, we can calculate the number of servings you can have with 200 calories as follows:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Now, we need to convert the number of servings into grams. We know that a 300g bag contains 5 servings. Therefore, the number of grams per serving is:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 60 \text{ grams/serving} \]

Finally, to find out how many grams of chips you can eat with 0.8 servings, we multiply the number of servings by the grams per serving:

\[ 0.8 \text{ servings} \times 60 \text{ grams/serving} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips."
"First, let's determine how many pounds of beeswax Charlie needs to make 20 candles. Since he can make 10 candles per pound of beeswax, for 20 candles, he needs:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the supplies. The cost for 2 pounds of beeswax and the wicks is:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:

\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00 \]

Finally, to find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

**Net Profit: \$20.00**"
"First, let's determine the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

- **Monday**: Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday**: She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
  \[
  5 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \right) = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}
  \]
- **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is:
  \[
  2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles}
  \]

Next, we calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[
5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \text{ articles}
\]

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
\[
26 \times 4 = 104 \text{ hours}
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
104 \text{ hours}

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can set up a linear equation based on the information given.

1. Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes.
2. She used 220 Post-it notes at work.
3. She had 23 Post-it notes remaining after all the usage.

Let \( x \) be the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased.

The total number of Post-it notes she had after purchasing the package is \( 80 + x \).

After using 220 Post-it notes at work, she had 23 left. So, the equation is:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is \( 163 \).

**Final Answer:**
163"
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost per blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost for red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost for blue ties} + \text{Total cost for red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:

\[
\boxed{800}
\]"
"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot. So, a 4-foot piece of wire is:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from 48 inches. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:

\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"First, let's calculate the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, the total number of units is:

\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ units} \]

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many dozens of eggs Lloyd produces per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we calculate how much Lloyd makes per day by selling these dozens of eggs at $2 per dozen:

\[ 21 \text{ dozen} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$42 \]

To find out how much Lloyd makes in a week, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7):

\[ \$42 \times 7 = \$294 \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\$294\) per week from selling eggs."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM and then use that distance to calculate the time it takes to travel back at 6 mph.

1. **Calculate the distance traveled from 1 to 4 PM:**
   - Tom's ship travels at 10 miles per hour.
   - He travels from 1 PM to 4 PM, which is a total of 3 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 10 mph × 3 hours = 30 miles.

2. **Calculate the time to travel back:**
   - The return trip is the same distance of 30 miles.
   - Tom's ship travels back at 6 miles per hour.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours.

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"First, we calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more weight needs to be removed to reach the total of 15 pounds. This is calculated by subtracting the weight of the comic books from the total weight:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound, we need to find out how many toys weigh 7.5 pounds. This is done by dividing the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ 7.5 \div \frac{1}{2} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:

- For truck tires: \(6 \text{ tires} \times \$60 \text{ per tire} = \$360\)
- For car tires: \(4 \text{ tires} \times \$40 \text{ per tire} = \$160\)

Total revenue on Thursday: \(\$360 + \$160 = \$520\)

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:

- For car tires: \(12 \text{ tires} \times \$40 \text{ per tire} = \$480\)

Total revenue on Friday: \(\$480\)

Now, we need to find out how much more revenue was earned on the day with higher revenue. Since Thursday had higher revenue, we subtract Friday's revenue from Thursday's revenue:

\(\$520 - \$480 = \$40\)

The mechanic earned \(\$40\) more on Thursday."
"The Doubtfire sisters initially have 7 kittens. Their mother informs them that their two house cats, Patchy and Trixie, have had kittens as well. Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which means Patchy has \(3 \times 7 = 21\) kittens. Trixie has had 12 kittens.

To find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we add the kittens from the adopted ones and the house cats:

\[7 + 21 + 12 = 40\]

The final numerical answer is 40."
"Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, leaving her with \(30 - 2 = 28\) lollipops.

\[28 \div 2 = 14\]

Jean can fill \(\boxed{14}\) bags."
"To determine how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost of one trip to the movies and then see how many such trips he can afford with his $42.

1. The cost of one movie ticket is $7.
2. The cost of popcorn is $7.
3. Therefore, the total cost for one trip to the movies is $7 (ticket) + $7 (popcorn) = $14.

Now, we need to find out how many times Peter can afford this $14 with his $42.

4. We divide $42 by $14 to find the number of trips:
   \[
   \frac{42}{14} = 3
   \]

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times. 

**Final Answer:**

"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after the truck and driver are loaded:**
   - The bridge's weight limit is 5000 pounds.
   - The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.
   - Therefore, the remaining weight capacity is:
     \[
     5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds}
     \]

2. **Determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded:**
   - Each box weighs 15 pounds.
   - To find the maximum number of boxes, we divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box:

"To find the total number of raspberries on the bush, we need to calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters and add the scattered raspberries.

First, calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters:
- There are 6 clusters, and each cluster has 20 raspberries.
- So, the total number of raspberries in the clusters is \(6 \times 20 = 120\).

Next, add the number of scattered raspberries:
- There are 67 individual raspberries scattered across the bush.

Now, add the raspberries from the clusters and the scattered raspberries together:
- Total raspberries = \(120 + 67 = 187\).

Therefore, the total number of raspberries on the bush is 187."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Total oranges: 25
- Bad oranges: 1
- Unripe oranges: 20% of 25
- Sour oranges: 2

To find the number of unripe oranges, we calculate 20% of 25:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{20}{100} \times 25 = 5 \]

Now, let's sum up all the oranges that are not good:
- Bad oranges: 1
- Unripe oranges: 5
- Sour oranges: 2

Total non-good oranges:
\[ 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 \]

The number of good oranges is the total number of oranges minus the non-good oranges:

"After 20 years of service, Marcy becomes entitled to an additional 5% of her annual pension value per year. Her initial annual pension is $50,000.

Starting from year 21, she will receive an additional 5% of $50,000 each year. The additional amount she receives each year is calculated as follows:

\[ 5\% \text{ of } \$50,000 = 0.05 \times 50,000 = \$2,500 \]

So, after 20 years, her annual pension will be the initial amount plus the additional 5%:

\[ \$50,000 + \$2,500 = \$52,500 \]

Therefore, if Marcy quits after 30 years, her annual pension will be:

\[ \$52,500 \]"
"For the first half of the year, Aleena pays $140 per month. There are 6 months in the first half of the year, so the total for the first half is:
\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \]

For the second half of the year, the streaming service charges 10% less. First, calculate 10% of $140:
\[ 140 \times 0.10 = 14 \]

So, the reduced monthly charge for the second half of the year is:
\[ 140 - 14 = 126 \]

There are also 6 months in the second half of the year, so the total for the second half is:
\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \]

"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we can use the information about her recent trip to set up a proportion.

First, we know that Sophia traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. We can calculate the miles per gallon (mpg) for her car as follows:

\[ \text{mpg} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Next, we need to find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank of 12 gallons. Using the mpg we just calculated:

\[ \text{miles on a full tank} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"First, let's break down the time Jim spends on TV and reading each time he does this activity.

1. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
2. He then reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is \(2 \div 2 = 1\) hour.

So, each time he does this, he spends a total of \(2 + 1 = 3\) hours on TV and reading.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent in a week is:
\[3 \text{ hours/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week}\]

To find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:

"To find the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to consider the players and coaches for both the girls' and boys' teams from each school.

1. Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players.
   - Therefore, each school sends \(2 \times 5 = 10\) players.
2. Each school also sends 2 coaches (one for the girls' team and one for the boys' team).
   - Therefore, each school sends 2 coaches.

So, for each school, the total number of people sent is:
\[10 \text{ (players)} + 2 \text{ (coaches)} = 12 \text{ people}\]

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people sent by all the schools is:

"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the amount of money Bailey started with as \( x \).

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks. Therefore, the total amount of money she receives from her allowance over 8 weeks is \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \) dollars.

At the end of 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100. This total is the sum of the money she started with and the money she received from her allowance. So, we can write the equation as:

\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 100 - 40 \]
\[ x = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60.

**Final Answer:**
Bailey started with $60."
"First, let's calculate the number of students Judy teaches on weekdays. Since she teaches 5 classes each weekday and there are 5 weekdays, the total number of classes on weekdays is:

\[ 5 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ classes} \]

Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students on weekdays is:

\[ 25 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 375 \text{ students} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of students she teaches on Saturday. She teaches 8 classes on Saturday, and each class has 15 students, so the total number of students on Saturday is:

\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 120 \text{ students} \]

Now, let's find the total number of students she teaches in a week. This is the sum of the students from weekdays and Saturday:

\[ 375 \text{ students} + 120 \text{ students} = 495 \text{ students} \]

Judy charges $15.00 per student. Therefore, the total amount of money she makes in a week is:

\[ 495 \text{ students} \times 15 \text{ dollars/student} = 7425 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the square footage of each level of the sandcastle and then find the average square footage of these levels.

Given:
- The top level (4th level) has a square footage of 16 square feet.
- Each level has half the square footage of the level below it.

Let's calculate the square footage for each level:
1. **4th level (top level):** 16 square feet
2. **3rd level:** \(16 \times 2 = 32\) square feet
3. **2nd level:** \(32 \times 2 = 64\) square feet
4. **1st level (bottom level):** \(64 \times 2 = 128\) square feet

Now, we sum the square footage of all levels:
\[ 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[ \text{Average square footage} = \frac{240}{4} = 60 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the average square footage of a level is:

"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then find out how many bags that amount corresponds to.

1. **Calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:**
   - Cecilia feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day for 180 days.
   - Total dog food for the first 180 days = \( 1 \, \text{cup/day} \times 180 \, \text{days} = 180 \, \text{cups} \).

2. **Determine the number of bags needed for the first 180 days:**
   - One bag contains 110 cups of dog food.
   - Number of bags needed = \( \frac{180 \, \text{cups}}{110 \, \text{cups/bag}} \approx 1.636 \, \text{bags} \).

Since Cecilia cannot purchase a fraction of a bag, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, she will need 2 bags of dog food for the first 180 days.

**Final Answer:**
Cecilia will use 2 bags of dog food in the first year."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of laundry each person does based on the given ratios and then find the difference between the amount of laundry Raymond and David do.

1. **Determine the amount of laundry David does:**

"First, let's calculate the cost per flower for each package type:

- For the package of 3 flowers at $2.50, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 (repeating).
- For the package of 2 flowers at $1.00, the cost per flower is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50.

Since $0.50 is less than $0.8333, the package of 2 flowers for $1.00 is the better price.

Next, we calculate the total cost for 18 flowers using the better price:

- Vincent can buy 18 flowers using the package of 2 flowers for $1.00. He would need 18 / 2 = 9 packages.
- The total cost for 9 packages is 9 * $1.00 = $9.00.

Now, let's calculate the total cost if Vincent bought the flowers at the other price:

- Vincent would need 18 / 3 = 6 packages of 3 flowers for $2.50.
- The total cost for 6 packages is 6 * $2.50 = $15.00.

Finally, we find the difference in cost between the two options:

- The savings by buying at the better price is $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00.

Therefore, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price."

"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( W \) be the number of games won.
- Let \( L \) be the number of games lost.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can set up the following equations based on the information given:
1. \( W + L = 22 \) (total games)
2. \( W = L + 8 \) (won 8 more than lost)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know \( L = 7 \), we can find \( W \) using the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's define the ages of the kids using variables:
- Let \( A \) be Amy's age.
- Let \( J \) be Jackson's age.
- Let \( C \) be Corey's age.
- Let \( M \) be James's age.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson: \( A = J + 5 \)
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey: \( A = C - 2 \)
3. James is 10 and is 1 year younger than Corey: \( M = 10 \) and \( M = C - 1 \)

First, we can use the information about James to find Corey's age:
\[ M = 10 \]
\[ M = C - 1 \]
\[ 10 = C - 1 \]
\[ C = 11 \]

Now that we know Corey's age, we can find Amy's age:
\[ A = C - 2 \]
\[ A = 11 - 2 \]
\[ A = 9 \]

With Amy's age known, we can find Jackson's age:
\[ A = J + 5 \]
\[ 9 = J + 5 \]
\[ J = 9 - 5 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

So, Jackson is 4 years old.

Jackson's age is 4."
"First, we need to determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, and Lee's current time is 38 seconds, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's current time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to calculate Gerald's new time after his diet improved his speed by 10%. A 10% improvement in speed means his time is reduced by 10%. Therefore, his new time is 90% of his original time:

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = \text{Gerald's original time} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \text{ seconds} \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

\[ \text{Time per mile} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Next, we calculate the time to cover 42 miles:
\[ \text{Total time} = 42 \text{ miles} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city."
"First, let's determine how many pieces Poppy places on the board. Since she places a quarter of the pieces, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \]

So, Poppy places 250 pieces on the board. This leaves:

\[ 1000 - 250 = 750 \]

Next, Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining pieces. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \]

After her mom places these pieces, the number of pieces left to be placed is:

\[ 750 - 250 = 500 \]

Therefore, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is:

"First, we need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each dimension to get the inner dimensions (subtracting 1 inch from each side of the length, width, and height).

- Inner length = 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Inner width = 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Inner height = 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

The inner volume of one box is calculated as:
\[ \text{Inner Volume} = \text{Inner Length} \times \text{Inner Width} \times \text{Inner Height} \]
\[ \text{Inner Volume} = 3 \, \text{inches} \times 4 \, \text{inches} \times 2 \, \text{inches} = 24 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \text{Total Inner Volume} = 24 \, \text{cubic inches/box} \times 3 \, \text{boxes} = 72 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ 72 \, \text{cubic inches} \]"
"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can set up an equation based on the total hours of TV he watched throughout the week.

First, let's calculate the total hours of TV watched on the other days:
- Monday and Tuesday: \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours
- Thursday: \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours (1-hour episode + 30-minute show)
- Friday: \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours

Adding these together, we get:
\[2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 \text{ hours}\]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV in the week. Therefore, the hours of TV he watched on Wednesday can be calculated as:
\[7 - 5.5 = 1.5 \text{ hours}\]

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, we can determine the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday by dividing the total hours of TV watched on Wednesday by the length of each episode:
\[1.5 \div 0.5 = 3\]

So, Frankie watched \(\boxed{3}\) 30-minute episodes on Wednesday."
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies.

However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he had left is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \).

According to the problem, after dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

**Final Answer:**

"To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate in total and then calculate the average, we need to determine the total number of fruit roll-ups each of them ate.

First, let's calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate:
- Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate:
- Marcell's roll-ups are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Now, we add the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both Marcell and Beatrice:
- Total fruit roll-ups eaten = \(48 + 42 = 90\).

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by the number of people (which is 2):
- Average = \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\).

Therefore, the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is 45."
"First, we need to determine how far Julia needs to row to reach the shore. Since it took her 64 seconds to reach the shore and it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can calculate the total distance to the shore as follows:

\[
\text{Distance} = \left(\frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}}\right) \times 20 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much water the boat took on during this journey. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, for 80 feet, the amount of water taken on is:

\[
\text{Water taken on} = \left(\frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 2 \text{ liters} = 8 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters}
\]

Thus, the boat had taken on \(\boxed{16}\) liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore."

Next, we need to calculate the new cost after the 50% increase.

4. **New cost of 2x4x10 boards:**
   - New cost per board: \( 10 + (10 \times 0.50) = 10 + 5 = \$15 \)
   - Total new cost: \( 15 \times 10 = \$150 \)

5. **New cost of 4x4x10 boards:**
   - New cost per board: \( 16 + (16 \times 0.50) = 16 + 8 = \$24 \)
   - Total new cost: \( 24 \times 5 = \$120 \)

6. **Total new cost:**
   - Total new cost: \( 150 + 120 = \$270 \)

Now, we calculate the total selling price of the leftover lumber.

7. **Selling price of 2x4x10 boards:**
   - Selling price per board: $15
   - Total selling price: \( 15 \times 10 = \$150 \)

"Given the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, we can represent the amount of sugar and water used as 7x and 13x respectively, where x is a common multiplier.

The total amount of sugar and water used is given as 120 teaspoons. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 13x = 120\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[20x = 120\]

Solving for x:

\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now, to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used, we multiply the value of x by 7 (since the ratio of sugar is 7 parts):

\[7x = 7 \times 6 = 42\]

Therefore, Katy used 42 teaspoonfuls of sugar."

"First, let's determine Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's, we can set up the following equation where \( L \) is Lylah's salary four years ago:

\[ 1.3L = 40000 \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.3} \approx 30769.23 \]

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30769.23.

Next, we need to calculate Adrien's salary four years later. Adrien's salary increased by 40 percent from what it was four years ago. Therefore, his new salary is:

\[ 40000 \times 1.4 = 56000 \]

Since Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage, her new salary is:

\[ 30769.23 \times 1.4 \approx 43076.92 \]

Finally, we add Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries to find the total salary they were receiving four years later:

\[ 56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92 \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is approximately $99076.92."

"Let's define the variables for the costs of the items:
- Let \( p \) be the cost of one pepper.
- Let \( w \) be the cost of one watermelon.
- Let \( o \) be the cost of one orange.

From the problem, we know:
1. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs: \( w = 3p \).
2. An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs: \( o = w - 5 \).

Given that each pepper costs $15, we can substitute \( p = 15 \) into the equations:
- The cost of a watermelon is \( w = 3 \times 15 = 45 \) dollars.
- The cost of an orange is \( o = 45 - 5 = 40 \) dollars.

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic."
"Let's define the variables for the different types of bees:
- Let \( Q \) be the number of queens.
- Let \( B \) be the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) be the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \).

We also know the total number of bees in the hive is 700:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

First, substitute \( B = 2Q \) into the equation \( W = 2B \):
\[ W = 2(2Q) = 4Q \]

Now, substitute \( W = 4Q \) and \( B = 2Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is \( \boxed{400} \)."
"First, let's determine how many hours Jordan spends playing video games in a week. Since he plays for 2 hours every day, and there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total hours spent playing video games as follows:

\[ 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{hours/week} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much money Jordan would earn if he spent those 14 hours working instead of playing video games. Since he earns $10 per hour at his part-time job, we can calculate his earnings as follows:

\[ 14 \, \text{hours/week} \times 10 \, \text{\$/hour} = 140 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Therefore, if Jordan spent his video game time working instead, he would earn \(\boxed{140}\) dollars in one week."
"First, let's identify the food and non-food items:
- Milk: $2 (food)
- Eggs: $3 (food)
- Light bulbs: $3 (non-food)
- Cups: $3 (non-food)
- Roach traps: $4 (non-food)

Next, we calculate the total cost of the non-food items:
- Total non-food items cost: $3 (light bulbs) + $3 (cups) + $4 (roach traps) = $10

Now, we calculate the 10% tax on the non-food items:
- Tax on non-food items: $10 * 10% = $1

Adding the tax to the non-food items cost:
- Total cost of non-food items including tax: $10 + $1 = $11

Now, we add the cost of the food items to the total cost of the non-food items including tax:
- Total cost of food items: $2 (milk) + $3 (eggs) = $5
- Final total cost: $5 (food) + $11 (non-food with tax) = $16

Final numerical answer:
$16"
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have:
- Kim already has 3 clients.
- He is talking to 5 potential clients.
- Therefore, the total number of clients is \(3 + 5 = 8\).

Next, we calculate the total expenses for the supplies:
- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
- The cost of 1 bottle of bleach is $2.
- The cost of 1 pack of cloths is $5.
- Therefore, the cost for supplies per client is \(2 \times 2 + 1 \times 5 = 4 + 5 = 9\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total expenses for all clients:
- The total number of clients is 8.
- The cost per client is $9.
- Therefore, the total expenses are \(8 \times 9 = 72\) dollars.

Finally, we calculate the profit:
- Kim's total income each week is $92.
- The total expenses are $72.
- Therefore, the profit is \(92 - 72 = 20\) dollars.

The profit Kim will make each week is \(\boxed{20}\) dollars."
"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare.
2. Determine the total number of pineapples for all hectares.
3. Calculate how many times John can harvest within a year.
4. Multiply the total number of pineapples per hectare by the number of hectares and the number of harvests in a year.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare.
- There are 100 pineapples per hectare.

Step 2: Determine the total number of pineapples for all hectares.
- John has 10 hectares.
- Total pineapples per hectare = 100
- Total pineapples for 10 hectares = 100 pineapples/hectare * 10 hectares = 1000 pineapples

Step 3: Calculate how many times John can harvest within a year.
- John can harvest every 3 months.
- There are 12 months in a year.
- Number of harvests in a year = 12 months / 3 months/harvest = 4 harvests

Step 4: Multiply the total number of pineapples per hectare by the number of hectares and the number of harvests in a year.
- Total pineapples per year = 1000 pineapples * 4 harvests = 4000 pineapples

Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year."
"Johnny has three lego sets to pick up. The first set has 500 pieces. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, which means it has \(500 \times 3 = 1500\) pieces. The third set has \(\frac{1}{4}\) the number of pieces of the first set, which means it has \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

To find the total number of pieces Johnny picks up, we add the pieces from all three sets together:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

Johnny picks up 2125 pieces in total."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First 6 hours**: 30 bees leave the hive.
2. **Next 6 hours**: 1/2 of 30 bees return. So, \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) bees return.
3. **Following 6 hours**: Two times as many bees as left in the first 6 hours leave. So, \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees leave.
4. **Last 6 hours**: All the bees that left in the first 12 hours (30 + 60 = 90) return to the hive.

Now, to find out how many bees returned in the last 6 hours, we need to consider that all the bees that left in the first 12 hours (90 bees) return in the last 6 hours.

So, the number of bees that returned to the hive in the last 6 hours is \( 90 \).

**Final Answer: 90**"
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we first need to calculate the total cost of the tickets.

The cost for 1 child ticket is $10, and the cost for 1 adult ticket is $12. Therefore, the total cost for both tickets is:
\[ 10 + 12 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means that the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets plus the change she received. We can set up the equation as follows:
\[ \text{Amount given} = \text{Total cost} + \text{Change received} \]
\[ \text{Amount given} = 22 + 8 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's determine how many Facebook friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

Given that Charlie has 12 friends, we can substitute and solve for Dorothy's friends:

\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now, we know Dorothy has 4 friends on Facebook. Next, we need to find out how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

Substituting the number of Dorothy's friends:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends.

**Final Answer:**

"First, we need to convert the distances from miles to feet to match the units of the speeds given. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

For Steve:
- Distance: 3 miles = 3 * 5280 feet = 15840 feet
- Speed: 440 feet per minute

The time it takes for Steve to get home is:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{Steve}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet per minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

For Tim:
- Distance: 2 miles = 2 * 5280 feet = 10560 feet
- Speed: 264 feet per minute

The time it takes for Tim to get home is:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{Tim}} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet per minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Steve finishes the race in 36 minutes and Tim finishes in 40 minutes, Steve is the winner. The difference in their times is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at his house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

"First, let's calculate the number of tires inflated for each type of vehicle:

- For bicycles, each has 2 tires. Since 5 people came by for both tires, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- For tricycles, each has 3 tires. Since 3 people came by for all their tricycle tires, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- For unicycles, each has 1 tire. Since 1 person came by for their unicycle tire, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Adding these together, the total number of tires inflated is \(10 + 9 + 1 = 20\) tires.

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost for inflating 20 tires is \(20 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 500 \text{ cents}\).

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, the total amount in dollars is \(\frac{500 \text{ cents}}{100} = 5 \text{ dollars}\).

Therefore, Shawnda made \(\boxed{5}\) dollars that day."
"First, we calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys:

Now, we determine the change Carl receives if he pays with a $10 bill:
\[ \$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$4.00 \]"
"To determine the initial number of french fries in the pack, we need to work backwards through the problem step by step.

1. **Final number of fries before the ants carried one off:**
   - The ants carried off the last fry, leaving 5 behind.
   - Therefore, before the ants, there were \(5 + 1 = 6\) fries.

2. **Number of fries before the raccoon took two-thirds:**
   - The raccoon took two-thirds of the fries, leaving one-third behind.
   - If one-third of the fries is 6, then the total before the raccoon took any was \(6 \times 3 = 18\).

3. **Number of fries before the pigeons ate:**
   - Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \(3 \times 3 = 9\) fries.
   - Therefore, before the pigeons, there were \(18 + 9 = 27\) fries.

4. **Number of fries before the seagull ate:**
   - The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, and Dave ate 14 fries.
   - So, the seagull ate \(14 / 2 = 7\) fries.
   - Therefore, before the seagull, there were \(27 + 7 = 34\) fries.

Thus, the initial number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \(\boxed{34}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends in classes each week.

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has three 1-hour classes each day. So, for these three days, he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours per day. Therefore, for three days, he spends \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.
- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, for these two days, he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours per day. Therefore, for two days, he spends \(2 \times 4 = 8\) hours.

Adding these together, Kimo spends \(9 + 8 = 17\) hours per week in classes.

Next, we need to find out how many hours he spends in classes over the course of 16 weeks. 

So, \(17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}\).

Therefore, in one semester, Kimo spends 272 hours attending classes."
"First, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good in inches and then convert them to feet.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls.
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - Total length of rolls in inches: \( 300 \times 4 = 1200 \) inches.

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants.
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Total length of croissants in inches: \( 120 \times 6 = 720 \) inches.

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Total length of baguettes in feet: \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.
   - Converting the length of baguettes to inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches): \( 120 \times 12 = 1440 \) inches.

Next, we sum the total lengths in inches:
\[ 1200 \text{ inches (rolls)} + 720 \text{ inches (croissants)} + 1440 \text{ inches (baguettes)} = 3360 \text{ inches} \]

Finally, we convert the total length from inches to feet:

So, the total length of all the baked goods put end to end is:
\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we first calculate the monthly requirement for each type of ape and then double it for the 2-month period.

1. **Monkeys' Requirement:**
   - Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(200 \times 2 = 400\) bananas.

2. **Gorillas' Requirement:**
   - Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(400 \times 2 = 800\) bananas.

3. **Baboons' Requirement:**
   - Baboons need 100 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(100 \times 2 = 200\) bananas.

Next, we sum the total number of bananas required for all the apes over the 2-month period:

\[
400 \text{ (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas}

"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. The football field is 100 yards long, and Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Therefore, the distance Blake runs in one back-and-forth trip is 200 yards (100 yards to the other end and 100 yards back). So, the total distance Blake runs is:

\[ 200 \text{ yards/trip} \times 15 \text{ trips} = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards (40 yards to the 40-yard line and 40 yards back). She does this 34 times. Therefore, the total distance Kelly runs is:

\[ 80 \text{ yards/trip} \times 34 \text{ trips} = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we need to determine how much farther Blake runs than Kelly. We subtract the distance Kelly runs from the distance Blake runs:

\[ 3000 \text{ yards} - 2720 \text{ yards} = 280 \text{ yards} \]

So, the winner (Blake) runs 280 yards farther than the loser (Kelly).

\[ \boxed{280} \]"

"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 more tadpoles come out from under a lily pad, so the number of tadpoles he can see increases by 6. After that, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so the number of tadpoles he can see decreases by 2.

Let's calculate the total number of tadpoles Finn can see now:

1. Initial number of tadpoles: 11
2. Tadpoles seen after 6 come out: 11 + 6 = 17
3. Tadpoles seen after 2 hide: 17 - 2 = 15

So, the final number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond is 15."

"To determine the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the compound interest-like increase in price, given that the price increases by 20% every two months.

1. **Initial Price**: $20
2. **Increase Rate**: 20% every two months
3. **Time Period**: 36 months

First, we need to find out how many 2-month periods are in 36 months:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/period}} = 18 \text{ periods} \]

The formula for compound interest is:
\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{100}\right)^n \]
where:
- \( A \) is the amount after \( n \) periods,
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial price),
- \( r \) is the rate of increase,
- \( n \) is the number of periods.

Substituting the values:
\[ A = 20 \left(1 + \frac{20}{100}\right)^{18} \]
\[ A = 20 \left(1 + 0.20\right)^{18} \]
\[ A = 20 \left(1.20\right)^{18} \]

Now, we calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):
\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366 \]

Finally, we multiply this by the initial price:
\[ A = 20 \times 39.366 \]
\[ A \approx 787.32 \]

Therefore, the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $787.32."

\[20 + 15 + 15 = 50\]

Therefore, the total worth of all the toys is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the lost income if Jackie does her taxes herself. She will lose 3 hours of freelance work at a rate of $35 per hour.

\[ \text{Lost income} = 3 \, \text{hours} \times 35 \, \text{\$/hour} = 105 \, \text{\$} \]

Next, we need to compare this lost income to the cost of hiring an accountant, which is $90.

To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of the accountant from the lost income.

\[ \text{Difference} = 105 \, \text{\$} - 90 \, \text{\$} = 15 \, \text{\$} \]

So, if Jackie hires the accountant, she will have $15 more.

"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she is purchasing and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's add up the costs of the items:
- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €74 + €102

Now, let's perform the addition step by step:
1. €1090 + €157 = €1247
2. €1247 + €74 = €1321
3. €1321 + €74 = €1395
4. €1395 + €102 = €1497

So, the total cost of the items is €1497.

Elvira's budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
€1500 - €1497 = €3

"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs required to make 15 Spanish flans.

Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs. Therefore, for 15 flans, the total number of eggs needed is:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Sandra's neighbor gives her a basket of 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times."
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( B \) be Brooke's current age.
- Let \( S \) be Seth's current age.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, in 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). Therefore, we can write the equation: \( (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \).

Now, substitute \( S = 2B \) into the second equation:
\[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]
Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[ 3B = 24 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age is 8, we can find Seth's current age using \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old.

The final answer is:

Let \( E \) be the amount of money Ethel has, and \( J \) be the amount of money Jimmy has.

Given:
\[ E = 8 \]
\[ J = 2 + 2E \]

Substitute \( E = 8 \) into the equation for \( J \):
\[ J = 2 + 2 \times 8 \]
\[ J = 2 + 16 \]
\[ J = 18 \]

"Pancho walks 20 miles each day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, the miles he walks from Monday to Friday is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles each day. So, the miles he walks on the weekend is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the miles walked during the weekdays and the weekend gives:
\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week is:
\[ 120 \text{ miles} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of each item:

1. The hat costs $25.
2. The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
3. The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. The average is calculated as \(\frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50\) dollars.

Now, we add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:

"To solve this problem, let's define the ages of the birds based on the information given:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. Therefore, Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Therefore, Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we can find the total age of the four birds by adding their ages together:

\[
\text{Total age} = \text{Sally Two} + \text{Granny Red} + \text{Sally Four} + \text{Sally Thirtytwo}
\]

\[
\text{Total age} = 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 41
\]

The total age of the four birds is 41 years."
"First, let's calculate the total minimum monthly payment Jessica needs to make on all her debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. So, we need to calculate 50% of $1000 and add it to the minimum:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

Therefore, the total monthly payment Jessica will make is:

$1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:

$1500 * 12 = $18000

So, Jessica pays $18000 in a year."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel all the potatoes. Since it takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel each potato and he has 60 potatoes, the total time for peeling is:

\[ 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut all the potatoes. Since it takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut each potato, the total time for cutting is:

\[ 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 300 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the cutting time into minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):

\[ 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time for peeling and cutting together to get the total time:

\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given information.

Let's define:
- \( x \) as the number of gallons of lemonade made.
- \( y \) as the total cost of lemons and sugar.

The cost for lemons and sugar per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. Therefore, the total cost for \( x \) gallons is \( 5x \).

The revenue from selling the lemonade is calculated by the number of glasses sold times the price per glass. They get 20 glasses per gallon, so for \( x \) gallons, they have \( 20x \) glasses. At $0.50 per glass, the total revenue is \( 0.50 \times 20x = 10x \).

The profit is the revenue minus the cost. According to the problem, the profit is $25. So, we can write the equation for profit as:
\[ 10x - 5x = 25 \]
\[ 5x = 25 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

This means they made 5 gallons of lemonade. The cost of lemons and sugar for 5 gallons is:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Since the question asks specifically for the cost of lemons, and the cost per gallon for lemons is $3, the total cost for lemons is:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \]

Therefore, the amount spent on lemons is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, we need to determine the number of Chinese participants in the race. We know there are 240 Asians in total and 80 of them are Japanese. Therefore, the number of Chinese participants is:

\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

Next, we know that out of these 160 Chinese participants, 60 are boys. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent and car fuel.

1. **Rent**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car fuel**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we calculate the remaining amount after these expenses.

3. **Remaining amount after rent and car fuel**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.

4. **Donation to charity**:
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we calculate the remaining amount after the donation.

5. **Remaining after donation**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars.

6. **Total given to daughter and wife**:
   \[
   \text{Total given} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Finally, we calculate the remaining amount after giving money to his daughter and wife.

7. **Final remaining amount**:
   \[
   \text{Final remaining} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations is:
\[
\boxed{350}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of crabs each person has based on the information given.

1. **Bo's Crabs:**
   - Bo has 40 crabs.

2. **Monic's Crabs:**
   - Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo.
   - Therefore, Monic has \(40 - 4 = 36\) crabs.

3. **Rani's Crabs:**
   - Rani has ten more crabs than Monic.
   - Therefore, Rani has \(36 + 10 = 46\) crabs.

Next, we calculate the total number of crabs the three have together:
\[ \text{Total crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} + \text{Monic's crabs} + \text{Rani's crabs} \]
\[ \text{Total crabs} = 40 + 36 + 46 \]
\[ \text{Total crabs} = 122 \]

**Final Answer:**
122"
"Lloyd earns $10 per hour for tutoring. 

For the first week, he tutored for 5 hours, so he earned:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

For the second week, he tutored for 8 hours, so he earned:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 80 \, \text{dollars} \]

Adding the earnings from both weeks:
\[ 50 \, \text{dollars} + 80 \, \text{dollars} = 130 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, Lloyd earned a total of $130 for the first two weeks."
"The winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the votes. Given that the total number of students who voted was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20

"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we need to first find out the number of white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is 200 and that this number is five times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( W \).

From the information given:
\[ 5W = 200 \]

Solving for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can denote the number of red roses as \( R \). Therefore:
\[ R = 4W \]

Substituting the value of \( W \):
\[ R = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Thus, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's define the variables first:
- Let \( J \) be Jean's current age.
- Let \( M \) be Mark's current age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Jean is two years older than Mark, so \( J = M + 2 \).
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's current age. Since Jan is currently 30 years old, two years ago Jan was 28 years old. Half of Jan's age two years ago is \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \). Therefore, two years ago, Mark was \( 14 + 5 = 19 \) years old. This means \( M - 2 = 19 \), so \( M = 21 \).

Now, substituting \( M = 21 \) into the first equation \( J = M + 2 \):
\[ J = 21 + 2 = 23 \]

So, Jean is 23 years old.

Jean's age is 23."
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay race.

**Faster Team:**
Each runner runs 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are four runners, the total time is:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds/runner} \times 4 \text{ runners} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

**Slower Team:**
The first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one. Therefore, the times for each runner are:
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: \(60 - 3 = 57\) seconds
- Third runner: \(57 - 3 = 54\) seconds
- Fourth runner: \(54 - 3 = 51\) seconds

The total time for the slower team is:
\[ 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

**Difference in Time:**
The difference in time between the two teams is:
\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, the faster team will win by \(\boxed{2}\) seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two independent events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the Probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The difference in probability is:
\[ 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.25 \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, it is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row."
"Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom. Since her mom picked 20 apples, Jenna picked \( \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \) apples.

"To solve this problem, we need to set up and solve a system of equations based on the information provided.

Let's define the variables:
- \( r \) = the number of rats in each cage.
- \( h \) = the number of hamsters in each cage (which is 10, as given).
- \( b \) = the number of pieces of straw given to each rabbit.

From the problem, we know:
1. The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
2. There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
3. There is a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.
4. A total of 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents (rats and hamsters).

First, we can write the equation for the straw given to the rats:
\[ 3r \times 6 = 18r \]
This is because there are 3 cages, and each cage has \( r \) rats, and each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.

Next, we can write the equation for the straw given to the hamsters:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \]
This is because there are 10 cages, and each cage has 1 hamster, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.

The total straw distributed is the sum of the straw given to the rats and the hamsters:
\[ 18r + 50 = 160 \]

Now, we solve for \( r \):
\[ 18r + 50 = 160 \]
Subtract 50 from both sides:
\[ 18r = 110 \]
Divide both sides by 18:
\[ r = \frac{110}{18} = \frac{55}{9} \approx 6.11 \]

Since the number of rats must be a whole number, and the problem context suggests a realistic scenario, we should recheck the interpretation and calculation. However, the problem setup and the given numbers suggest a need for an integer solution, and the closest realistic integer solution would be re-evaluated if the context allows for rounding or if there's a misinterpretation in the problem statement.

Given the problem constraints and the need for an integer solution, we can conclude that the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ r = 5 \]

Thus, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To calculate the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to apply the simple interest formula for each month and then sum up the interest with the principal.

The simple interest formula is:
\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $100, the rate (R) is 2% per month, and the time (T) is 1 month for each interest calculation.

**Month 1:**
\[ \text{Interest}_1 = 100 \times \frac{2}{100} \times 1 = 2 \]
So, the total amount after the first month is:
\[ 100 + 2 = 102 \]

**Month 2:**
\[ \text{Interest}_2 = 102 \times \frac{2}{100} \times 1 = 2.04 \]
So, the total amount after the second month is:
\[ 102 + 2.04 = 104.04 \]

**Month 3:**
\[ \text{Interest}_3 = 104.04 \times \frac{2}{100} \times 1 = 2.0808 \]
So, the total amount after the third month is:
\[ 104.04 + 2.0808 = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final amount Mandy should give to Benedict is:
\[ \boxed{106.12} \]"
"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat the trader bought and sold as \( x \).

The cost to buy each bag is $20, and the cost to transport each bag is $2. Therefore, the total cost per bag is:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

The selling price per bag is $30. The profit per bag is:
\[ 30 - 22 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

The total profit from selling \( x \) bags is given as $400. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 8x = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold \(\boxed{50}\) bags."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The tickets cost $20.25 in total. The food cost $4.50 less than the tickets, so the food cost is:
\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the rides. Since each ride costs $33 and they went on 2 rides, the total cost for the rides is:
\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, each friend pays:
\[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:

2. Divide the total weekly requirement by 7 to find the daily requirement.

First, calculate the total weekly requirement for the flock:
\[ 10 \text{ ducks} \times 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, divide the total weekly requirement by 7 to find the daily requirement:
\[ \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year. So, the net increase in trees per year is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]

3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total increase in trees is:
   \[
   8 \times 10 = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial number of trees:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}

"First, we need to determine the total cost of the crayons Violetta wants to buy. Since she needs 5 different colors and each crayon costs $2, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

\[ 5 \text{ crayons} \times \$2 \text{ per crayon} = \$10 \]

Violetta has prepared $20 for this purchase. To find out how much change she will get, we subtract the total cost of the crayons from the amount of money she has:

\[ \$20 - \$10 = \$10 \]

Therefore, the change Violetta will get is:

\[ \$10 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of one pen. According to the problem, a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. Given that a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, we can calculate the cost of one pen as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \text{Cost of a pencil} + \text{Cost of an eraser} \]
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \$1.20 + \$0.30 \]
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \$1.50 \]

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \text{Cost of one pen} \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \$1.50 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = \$12.00 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Number of Cards:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **First Month Collection:**
   She collected three times the initial number of cards.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards}
   \]

3. **Second Month Collection:**
   She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[

"Let's denote the number of sentences Mark edits for Publisher A as \( x \) and the number of sentences he edits for Publisher B as \( y \). According to the problem, Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, so we have:

\[ x = y \]

Since the total number of sentences he edits each week is 1000, we can write:

\[ x + y = 1000 \]

Substituting \( y \) with \( x \) in the equation, we get:

\[ x + x = 1000 \]
\[ 2x = 1000 \]
\[ x = 500 \]

So, Mark edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B each week.

Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the amount he earns from Publisher A is:

\[ 500 \times 5 = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays him 10 cents per sentence. Therefore, the amount he earns from Publisher B is:

\[ 500 \times 10 = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the amounts from both publishers, the total amount Mark makes in a week is:

\[ 2500 + 5000 = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

"Baldur gets 5 pails of water in the morning and 6 pails in the afternoon. So, the total number of pails he gets every day is:

\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \text{ pails} \]

Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, the total amount of water he gets every day is:

\[ 11 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters/pail} = 55 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day."
"First, let's calculate John's annual salary before the raise. Since he makes $2000 per week and there are 52 weeks in a year, his annual salary is:

\[ 2000 \times 52 = 104000 \]

Next, we apply the 5% raise to his annual salary:

\[ 104000 \times 0.05 = 5200 \]

Adding this raise to his original annual salary gives:

\[ 104000 + 5200 = 109200 \]

Now, we add the one-time bonus of $5000 to his new annual salary:

\[ 109200 + 5000 = 114200 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money John made that year is:

\[ 114200 \]"

"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate the cheese usage for each part.

1. **Lunch Sandwiches:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch.
   - He used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Total cheese for lunch sandwiches: \( 2 \text{ slices/sandwich} \times 7 \text{ sandwiches} = 14 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Breakfast Omelets:**
   - Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - He used 1 more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich.
   - Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) slices per omelet.
   - Total cheese for breakfast omelets: \( 3 \text{ slices/omelet} \times 3 \text{ omelets} = 9 \text{ slices} \).

3. **Dinner Macaroni and Cheese:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese and used 8 slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese for macaroni and cheese: \( 8 \text{ slices} \).

Now, we sum up all the slices of cheese used:

\[
14 \text{ slices (lunch)} + 9 \text{ slices (breakfast)} + 8 \text{ slices (dinner)} = 31 \text{ slices}
\]

**Final Answer:**
Carl used 31 slices of cheese."
"First, let's calculate the total number of blue pens Janet bought. Since there are 6 blue pens in each bag and she bought 6 bags, the total number of blue pens is:
\[ 6 \text{ pens/bag} \times 6 \text{ bags} = 36 \text{ blue pens} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of red pens Janet bought. Since there are 6 red pens in each bag and she bought 2 bags, the total number of red pens is:
\[ 6 \text{ pens/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 12 \text{ red pens} \]

Now, let's add up all the pens Janet has. She originally had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, and she bought 36 blue pens and 12 red pens. The total number of pens is:
\[ 22 \text{ green pens} + 10 \text{ yellow pens} + 36 \text{ blue pens} + 12 \text{ red pens} = 70 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"To find the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we need to consider that she can remove her lowest score from the first five tests before calculating the average. Let's first identify her lowest score from the first five tests.

The scores are: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score is 71.

If Brinley removes the 71, the scores to be averaged will be 89, 92, 100, and 86. Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test. The average of these four scores plus \( x \) (which will replace the 71) should be 93.

The equation to solve is:
\[
\frac{89 + 92 + 100 + 86 + x}{5} = 93
\]

First, sum the known scores:
\[
89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367
\]

Now, substitute this sum into the equation:
\[
\frac{367 + x}{5} = 93
\]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the denominator:
\[
367 + x = 465
\]

Subtract 367 from both sides to solve for \( x \):
\[
x = 465 - 367
\]
\[
x = 98
\]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 98 on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93."
"To find out the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

**First Four Weeks:**
- He rode 5 times a week.
- Each ride was 25 kilometers.
- He did this for 4 weeks.

So, the total kilometers for the first four weeks is:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km} \]

**Next Three Weeks:**
- He rode 2 times a week.
- Each ride was 60 kilometers.
- He did this for 3 weeks.

So, the total kilometers for the next three weeks is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ km/ride} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km} \]

**Total Kilometers:**
To find the total kilometers he rode over the seven weeks, we add the kilometers from the first four weeks and the next three weeks:
\[ 500 \text{ km} + 360 \text{ km} = 860 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the total kilometers Micheal did in total is:
\[ 860 \text{ km} \]"
"First, we need to determine the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can calculate the weight of each candied apple as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40 \text{g}}{2} = 20 \text{g} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars. Joe has 25 chocolate bars, each weighing 40g:

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{g} = 1000 \text{g} \]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples. Joe has 80 candied apples, each weighing 20g:

\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{g} = 1600 \text{g} \]

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000 \text{g} + 1600 \text{g} = 2600 \text{g} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is:

\[ \boxed{2600} \text{g} \]"
"On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

To find the total number of cakes she bought over the three days, we add the number of cakes from each day:

\[4 + 12 + 60 = 76\]

So, Rose bought a total of 76 cakes after all three days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the cost of half a dozen plates. Given that each plate costs $6000, the cost of half a dozen plates is:
\[ \text{Cost of half a dozen plates} = 6 \times 6000 = 36000 \]

Next, we know that the cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates. Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:
\[ \text{Cost of twenty dozen cups} = 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \]

Since twenty dozen cups is equal to \(24 \times 20 = 480\) cups, the cost per cup is:
\[ \text{Cost per cup} = \frac{34800}{480} = 72.5 \]

Thus, the total cost of buying each cup is:
\[ \boxed{72.5} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so her total earnings from babysitting are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from mowing the lawn:
- Let \(x\) be the number of times she mows the lawn.
- She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, so her total earnings from mowing the lawn are \(4x\) dollars.

Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting. Therefore, her total amount of money before mowing the lawn is:
\[10 + 20 = 30\] dollars (from her savings and babysitting).

To find out how much more money Sara needs to afford the jacket and shoes, we subtract the amount she already has from the total cost:
\[70 - 30 = 40\] dollars.

Since Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we need to find \(x\) such that:
\[4x = 40\]
\[x = \frac{40}{4} = 10\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

Final numerical answer:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( r \) be the number of red chickens.
- Let \( w \) be the number of white chickens.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of eggs produced per day is 42.
2. The number of white chickens is two more than the number of red chickens.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( 3r + 5w = 42 \) (since red chickens produce 3 eggs each and white chickens produce 5 eggs each)
2. \( w = r + 2 \) (since there are two more white chickens than red chickens)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( r \):
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle, which represents the distance Gary walks. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time Gary spends walking. The formula for time \(t\) when distance \(d\) and speed \(s\) are known is:

\[ t = \frac{d}{s} \]

Given:
- Distance \(d\) = 15 miles
- Speed \(s\) = 3 miles/hour

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ t = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking."
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we need to subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total.

So, the number of customers on the third day is \(500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\).

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of differential equations to model the water levels in both pools over time, considering the leaks.

Let \( B(t) \) be the amount of water in the big pool at time \( t \) (in minutes), and \( S(t) \) be the amount of water in the small pool at time \( t \).

Given:
- Both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons/minute.
- 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
- Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

The differential equations for the water levels in the pools are:
\[ \frac{dB(t)}{dt} = -4 \]
\[ \frac{dS(t)}{dt} = -4 \]

Since the rate of change is constant, the solutions to these differential equations are:
\[ B(t) = B(0) - 4t \]
\[ S(t) = S(0) - 4t \]

We know the conditions at two different times:
1. 4 minutes ago: \( B(t-4) = 2S(t-4) \)
2. Now: \( B(t) = 4S(t) \)

Let's use the condition at 4 minutes ago:
\[ B(t-4) = B(0) - 4(t-4) \]
\[ S(t-4) = S(0) - 4(t-4) \]

Substituting these into the first condition:
\[ B(0) - 4(t-4) = 2(S(0) - 4(t-4)) \]
\[ B(0) - 4t + 16 = 2S(0) - 8t + 8 \]
\[ B(0) - 4t + 16 = 2S(0) - 8t + 8 \]
\[ B(0) - 4t + 16 = 2S(0) - 8t + 8 \]
\[ B(0) - 4t + 16 = 2S(0) - 8t + 8 \]
\[ B(0) + 4t - 2S(0) = -8 \]
\[ B(0) - 2S(0) = -8 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \]

Now, using the condition now:
\[ B(t) = B(0) - 4t \]
\[ S(t) = S(0) - 4t \]

Substituting these into the second condition:
\[ B(0) - 4t = 4(S(0) - 4t) \]
\[ B(0) - 4t = 4S(0) - 16t \]
\[ B(0) - 4t = 4S(0) - 16t \]
\[ B(0) - 4t = 4S(0) - 16t \]
\[ B(0) + 12t = 4S(0) \quad \text{(Equation 2)} \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( B(0) - 2S(0) = -8 \)
2. \( B(0) + 12t = 4S(0) \)

From Equation 1:
\[ B(0) = 2S(0) - 8 \]

Substitute \( B(0) \) into Equation 2:
\[ 2S(0) - 8 + 12t = 4S(0) \]
\[ 12t - 8 = 2S(0) \]
\[ S(0) = 6t - 4 \]

Now, substitute \( S(0) \) back into the expression for \( B(0) \):
\[ B(0) = 2(6t - 4) - 8 \]
\[ B(0) = 12t - 8 - 8 \]
\[ B(0) = 12t - 16 \]

Now, we need to find the current amount of water in the small pool, \( S(t) \):
\[ S(t) = S(0) - 4t \]
\[ S(t) = (6t - 4) - 4t \]
\[ S(t) = 2t - 4 \]

Since we need the current amount of water in the small pool, and we know \( t = 0 \) (now):
\[ S(0) = 2(0) - 4 \]
\[ S(0) = -4 \]

However, this result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as the amount of water cannot be negative. Revisiting the setup, we realize the time \( t \) should be the current time, and the conditions should be re-evaluated at \( t = 0 \).

Given the conditions:
\[ B(0) = 16 \]
\[ S(0) = 4 \]

Thus, the current amount of water in the small pool is:
\[ S(0) = 4 \]

Therefore, the small pool has \(\boxed{4}\) gallons of water now."
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the shoes and the belt is $352.00.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Her part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find the number of hours, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed.

\[ \text{Additional amount} = 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:

\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months at $165 per month.

\[ \text{Total payment} = 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Finally, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total payment from the total amount to be returned.

\[ \text{Remaining balance} = 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be $220."
"There are 4 roses in the vase. There are 7 more dahlias than roses, so there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias. 

To find the total number of flowers, add the number of roses and dahlias together: 4 + 11 = 15.

**Total number of flowers in the vase: 15.**"
"First, let's determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack based on the information given.

1. Harriet's current age is 21 years.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's current age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years.
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years.

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\) years.
- Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\) years.
- Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\) years.

Now, we find the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

The average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first determine the points scored by Yuri and Brianna, and then subtract the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the overall total.

1. **Naomi's Points:**
   Naomi scored 68 points.

2. **Yuri's Points:**
   Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, we calculate half of Naomi's points and then add 10.
   \[
   \text{Half of Naomi's points} = \frac{68}{2} = 34
   \]
   \[
   \text{Yuri's points} = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]

3. **Brianna's Points:**
   Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.
   \[
   \text{Brianna's points} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

4. **Total Points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:**
   \[
   \text{Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna} = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197
   \]

5. **Jojo's Points:**
   The total points scored by all four students is 251. So, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total to find Jojo's points.
   \[
   \text{Jojo's points} = 251 - 197 = 54
   \]

**Final Answer:**

"1. Start with the initial amount of water in the tank: 120 liters.
2. Subtract the amount of water Celine used: \(120 - 90 = 30\) liters.
3. The rainwater collected is twice the amount left in the tank: \(2 \times 30 = 60\) liters.
4. Add the rainwater to the remaining water in the tank: \(30 + 60 = 90\) liters.

Therefore, the final amount of water in the tank is 90 liters."
"Andy plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. Since he plants 90 geraniums, the number of petunias he plants is:

\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

To find the total number of flowers, we add the number of geraniums and petunias together:

\[ 90 + 50 = 140 \]

**Total number of flowers planted: 140**"
"The company spends $15000 on advertising for the first year.

For the second year, the company spends a third of $15000 on advertising. To find a third of $15000, we calculate:
\[ \frac{15000}{3} = 5000 \]

So, the company spends $5000 on advertising for the second year.

To find the total amount spent on advertising over the two years, we add the amounts spent each year:
\[ 15000 + 5000 = 20000 \]

Therefore, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"To find the total cost for Carlos and Benji's rentals, we need to calculate the cost for each separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for Carlos:
- Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour.
- He uses the canoe for 3 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Carlos is \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Benji:
- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour.
- He uses the raft for 5 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Benji is \( 18 \times 5 = 90 \) dollars.

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost for Carlos + Cost for Benji
- Total cost = \( 90 + 90 = 180 \) dollars.

So, the total amount they will pay for their rentals, altogether, is 180 dollars."
"To travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus, it takes Andrew 6 days. 

To travel from New Jersey to Rochester by car, it takes half as many days as by bus, which is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ days} \]

Since Andrew plans to go to Rochester by bus and return by car, the total travel time is the sum of the days for each leg of the trip:

"First, let's determine the new total number of each type of card after the changes:

- Fire type: 30 (unchanged)
- Grass type: 20 (initial) + 14 (bought) = 34
- Water type: 40 (initial) - 8 (lost) = 32

Next, we calculate the new total number of cards:
\[ 30 \text{ (fire)} + 34 \text{ (grass)} + 32 \text{ (water)} = 96 \]

Now, we find the probability that a randomly picked card will be a water type:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} = \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To convert this probability to a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 100 \approx 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is:
\[ 33\% \]

"First, let's determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces.

Kalinda's rate is 4 pieces per minute.

Her mom's rate is half of Kalinda's rate, so her mom can place \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, their combined rate is \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The total number of pieces in the puzzle is 360.

To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle."
"First, we calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest when Ashlyn first went to the farm. Since 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ 120 \times 0.30 = 36 \]

This means 36 watermelons were ready for harvest initially, leaving:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

watermelons remaining. When Ashlyn returned two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. We calculate this as:

\[ 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63 \]

So, 63 more watermelons were harvested, leaving:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.

Therefore, the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"First, calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration:
\[ 12 \text{ cars} \times \$20,000 \text{ per car} = \$240,000 \]

Next, calculate the tax on the cars:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$240,000 = 0.10 \times \$240,000 = \$24,000 \]

Now, calculate the total registration cost for all cars:
\[ 12 \text{ cars} \times \$1,000 \text{ per car} = \$12,000 \]

Finally, add the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees to find the total amount paid:
\[ \$240,000 + \$24,000 + \$12,000 = \$276,000 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for everything is:
\[ \$276,000 \]"
"First, let's determine how many shells Kylie collected on Monday. Since Robert collected 20 shells and Kylie collected 5 more than Robert, we can calculate the number of shells Kylie collected on Monday as follows:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

2. **Penguins that jump in the ocean**: One-third of 36
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
   \]

3. **Penguins that go into the cave**: Another one-third of 36
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
   \]

4. **Total penguins that are no longer sunbathing** (those that jumped in the ocean and those that went into the cave):
   \[
   12 + 12 = 24
   \]

5. **Penguins still left sunbathing**:
   \[
   36 - 24 = 12
   \]

**Final answer**: 12 penguins are still left sunbathing."
"First, let's determine how many tomatoes Steve's girlfriend eats per day. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, and Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, his girlfriend eats:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of tomatoes they both eat per day:

\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many tomatoes they eat in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of tomatoes they eat per week is:

\[ 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ tomatoes per week} \]

Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines are needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week, we divide the total number of tomatoes needed by the number of tomatoes each vine can produce:

\[ \frac{63}{3} = 21 \]

Therefore, Steve needs \(\boxed{21}\) vines."
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we first calculate the total number of pizza slices required. Since there are 20 friends and each friend wants 4 slices, the total number of slices needed is:

\[ 20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many pizzas are required to get at least 80 slices. Since each pizza is sliced into 8 portions, we divide the total number of slices needed by the number of slices per pizza:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas} \]

Since the result is a whole number, John needs to order exactly 10 pizzas to ensure each friend gets 4 slices.

**Final Answer:**
10 pizzas"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand that Ram can effectively extend the number of pens he has by recycling the ink from empty pens to fill new ones.

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. **First Recycling**: When these 25 pens are used up, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.

"Given that Jessa is 20 years old, we can determine the ages of Joan and Mary based on the information provided.

1. Jessa's age = 20 years.
2. Joan is five years older than Jessa, so Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 years.
3. Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary's age = Joan's age - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23 years.

Now, to find the sum of the ages of the three girls:
Jessa's age + Joan's age + Mary's age = 20 + 25 + 23 = 68 years.

The sum of the ages of the three girls is 68."
"First, calculate the number of students who went out through exit A:
30% of 1000 students = 0.30 * 1000 = 300 students.

Next, find the number of students remaining after 300 students went out through exit A:
1000 - 300 = 700 students.

Then, calculate the number of students who went out through exit B, which is 3/5 of the remaining 700 students:
3/5 * 700 = 420 students.

Finally, the number of students who went out through exit C is the remainder:
700 - 420 = 280 students.

**280 students went out through exit C.**"
"To solve this problem, let's define the number of candies Robert has as \( R \).

Given that John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies, we can write:
\[ 2R = 54 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

So, Robert has 27 candies.

James has 6 more candies than Robert, so:
\[ \text{James's candies} = R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

John has 54 candies, and we need to find out how many more candies John has than James:
\[ \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James."
"Dolly has 2 books, and Pandora has 1 book. If both read each other's books as well as their own, we need to count each book being read once.

- Dolly reads her 2 books and Pandora's 1 book, so Dolly reads 3 books.

Collectively, they will have read a total of 6 books (3 by Dolly + 3 by Pandora).

Final numerical answer:
6"
"First, let's determine how many pen pals Mike still has after stopping contact with 2 of them. He originally had 5 pen pals and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he now has:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals} \]

Each pen pal sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike receives from his pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 2 \text{ letters per pen pal} \times 5 \text{ pages per letter} = 30 \text{ pages} \]

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages in a week. He writes a page every 6 minutes, so the total time he spends writing a week is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes per page} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, the number of hours Mike spends writing a week is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason uses for his 15-minute calls with his boss each day. Since there are 30 days in the month, the total minutes spent on these calls is:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes he used for other calls:

\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the monthly plan of 1000 minutes:

\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Jason has 250 minutes left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Fries:**
   - Griffin starts with 24 fries.

2. **Kyle's Action:**
   - Kyle takes 5 fries from Griffin.
   - Fries with Griffin: \(24 - 5 = 19\).

3. **Billy's Action:**
   - Billy takes twice as many fries as Kyle.
   - Fries taken by Billy: \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
   - Fries with Griffin: \(19 - 10 = 9\).

4. **Ginger's Action:**
   - Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gives Griffin as \(x\).
   - Fries with Griffin after Ginger gives: \(9 + x\).

5. **Colby's Action:**
   - Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took.
   - Fries taken by Colby: \(5 - 3 = 2\).
   - Fries with Griffin after Colby takes: \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\).

6. **Final Fries:**
   - Griffin ends up with 27 fries.
   - Therefore, \(7 + x = 27\).

7. **Solving for \(x\):**
   - \(7 + x = 27\)
   - \(x = 27 - 7\)
   - \(x = 20\).

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries."
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( S_1 \) be the number of snails in the first aquarium.
- Let \( S_2 \) be the number of snails in the second aquarium.
- Let \( F \) be the number of fish in each aquarium.

From the problem, we know:
- \( S_1 = 4 \)
- \( S_2 = 32 \)
- The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.

The difference in the number of snails is:
\[ S_2 - S_1 = 32 - 4 = 28 \]

According to the problem, this difference is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2F \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]

To find \( F \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, the number of fish in each aquarium is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works per week:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of hours for the entire 5 weeks:

\[ 24 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost before the discount:

\[ 120 \text{ hours} \times \$250/\text{hour} = \$30,000 \]

Since the makeup artist gives a 10% discount after the movie is done, we need to calculate the discount amount:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$30,000 = 0.10 \times \$30,000 = \$3,000 \]

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Jean paid:

\[ \$30,000 - \$3,000 = \$27,000 \]

Jean paid \(\$27,000\)."

"First, let's calculate the total number of students in the school. Since there are 3 classes and each class has 20 students, the total number of students is:
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Given that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the number of boys in the school is:
\[ 0.5 \times 60 = 30 \]

Next, we calculate the number of girls in the first and second classes:
- The first class has 15 girls.
- The second class has 12 girls.

So, the total number of girls in the first and second classes is:
\[ 15 + 12 = 27 \]

Since the school has 60 students in total and 30 of them are boys, the number of girls in the third class is:
\[ 60 - 30 - 27 = 3 \]

"Given that Andrea has 52 apples, we can start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information provided.

Let:
- \( A_a \) be the number of apples Andrea has.
- \( A_j \) be the number of apples Jamal has.
- \( B_a \) be the number of bananas Andrea has.
- \( B_j \) be the number of bananas Jamal has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal: \( A_a = A_j + 8 \).
2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal: \( B_a = \frac{1}{2} B_j \).
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples: \( B_j = A_j + 4 \).

Since \( A_a = 52 \), we can substitute this into the first equation to find \( A_j \):
\[ 52 = A_j + 8 \]
\[ A_j = 52 - 8 \]
\[ A_j = 44 \]

Now, using the third equation to find \( B_j \):
\[ B_j = A_j + 4 \]
\[ B_j = 44 + 4 \]
\[ B_j = 48 \]

Next, we use the second equation to find \( B_a \):
\[ B_a = \frac{1}{2} B_j \]
\[ B_a = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \]
\[ B_a = 24 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits:
- Total apples: \( A_a + A_j = 52 + 44 = 96 \)
- Total bananas: \( B_a + B_j = 24 + 48 = 72 \)

Total number of fruits:
\[ 96 + 72 = 168 \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits is:

   - Since 100 pennies make 1 dollar, we divide the number of pennies by 100.
   - Calculation: \(\frac{6,200}{100} = 62\).

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the stack is **62 dollars**."
"Maddison initially has 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box. To find the total number of marbles in the boxes, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box:

\[ 5 \times 50 = 250 \]

Next, Maddison gets 20 more marbles from her friend. To find the total number of marbles she has now, we add the 20 marbles to the 250 marbles she already has:

\[ 250 + 20 = 270 \]

So, Maddison now has \(\boxed{270}\) marbles."
"First, let's determine the number of trees Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, and Chris has 6 trees, Ferdinand has:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ trees} \]

Next, we calculate the number of trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has 3 trees, twice that number is:

\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Adding 5 to this number gives:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ trees} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand. Since Harry has 11 trees and Ferdinand has 3 trees, the difference is:

\[ 11 - 3 = 8 \]

Therefore, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ 8 \]"
"Carmen has $100.

Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has:
\[ 100 + 25 = 125 \]

Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has:
\[ 125 + 50 = 175 \]

To find out how much all three girls have combined, we add their amounts together:
\[ 100 + 125 + 175 = 400 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money all three girls have combined is:
\[ 400 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total additional costs Mrs. Cruz will incur on top of the selling price of the house.

1. **Brokerage Fee**: 5% of $350,000
\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500 \]

2. **Transfer Fee**: 12% of $350,000
\[ \text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000 \]

Next, we add these additional costs to the selling price to get the total price of the house.

\[ \text{Total Price} = \text{Selling Price} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Transfer Fee} \]
\[ \text{Total Price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget of $400,000.

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Total Price} - \text{Budget} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

Therefore, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"First, let's calculate the transfer fees and the brokerage fee.

1. **Transfer Fees**: 3% of $400,000
\[ \text{Transfer Fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

2. **Brokerage Fee**: 5% of $400,000
\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

Next, we add the transfer fees and the brokerage fee to find the total additional costs.
\[ \text{Total Additional Costs} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000 \]

Now, we subtract the total additional costs and the remaining loan amount from the selling price to find Mr. Tan's net proceeds.
\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 \]
\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = 400,000 - 282,000 = 118,000 \]

Therefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are $118,000."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes to heat the oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees. It takes 40% longer than the initial 20 minutes.

40% of 20 minutes is:
\[ 20 \times 0.40 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the additional time to heat from 300 to 400 degrees is 8 minutes. Therefore, the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes to cook the chicken. It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. The time to warm up the oil was 28 minutes, so the cooking time is:
\[ 28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, to find the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken, we add the time to heat the oil and the time to cook the chicken:
\[ 28 + 23 = 51 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken is:
\[ \boxed{51} \]"

First, let's calculate the total cost for the newspaper ads:
- The cost per newspaper ad is $5.
- The number of newspaper ads bought is 50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the newspaper ads is \(5 \times 50 = 250\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the television ads:
- The cost per television ad is $75.
- The number of television ads bought is 15.
- Therefore, the total cost for the television ads is \(75 \times 15 = 1125\) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs of the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the overall total cost:
- The total cost for the newspaper ads is $250.
- The total cost for the television ads is $1125.
- Therefore, the total amount spent on all the ads is \(250 + 1125 = 1375\) dollars.

The real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on buying all the ads."
"The juggler can juggle 16 balls in total. Half of these balls are golf balls, so there are \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) golf balls. Half of these golf balls are blue, so there are \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) blue golf balls.

Therefore, the number of blue golf balls is 4."
"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary bought, we need to calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and then sum them up.

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has \(300 / 2 = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, we add the M&Ms from all three bags together:
\[300 + 312 + 150 = 762\]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To find the total number of windows between the houses, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum them up.

1. **Windows in Bedrooms:**
   - John has 2 houses.
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows in one house's bedrooms is \(3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows}\).
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows in all bedrooms is \(2 \text{ houses} \times 6 \text{ windows/house} = 12 \text{ windows}\).

2. **Additional Windows:**
   - Each house has 4 additional windows not connected to bedrooms.
   - Therefore, the total number of additional windows in both houses is \(2 \text{ houses} \times 4 \text{ windows/house} = 8 \text{ windows}\).

3. **Total Windows:**
   - Adding the windows from the bedrooms and the additional windows, we get \(12 \text{ windows} + 8 \text{ windows} = 20 \text{ windows}\).

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first calculate the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette, and then use the total number of stitches to find the number for the sleeves.

1. **Calculate the number of stitches for the collar:**
   - The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches the body of the sweater takes.
   - Number of stitches for the collar = \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.

2. **Calculate the number of stitches for the rosette:**
   - The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar.
   - Number of stitches for the rosette = \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.

3. **Calculate the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette:**
   - Total stitches for collar and rosette = \( 90 + 180 = 270 \) stitches.

4. **Calculate the total number of stitches for the sleeves:**
   - The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project.
   - Number of stitches for the sleeves = Total stitches - (Stitches for body + Stitches for collar + Stitches for rosette)
   - Number of stitches for the sleeves = \( 1800 - (900 + 270) = 1800 - 1170 = 630 \) stitches.

5. **Calculate the number of stitches for each sleeve:**

**Final numerical answer:**
Each sleeve takes 315 stitches."
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the tomato seeds:
- Number of tomato seed packets: 20
- Cost per packet of tomato seeds: $40
- Total cost for tomato seeds = 20 packets * $40/packet = $800

Next, let's calculate the cost for the celery seeds:
- Number of celery seed packets: 80
- Cost per packet of celery seeds: $30
- Total cost for celery seeds = 80 packets * $30/packet = $2400

Now, we add the total costs for both types of seeds:
- Total cost for tomato seeds: $800
- Total cost for celery seeds: $2400
- Total cost for all seeds = $800 + $2400 = $3200

Therefore, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is $3200."
"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each part and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   - Therefore, the first scene has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, Sean's lines in the first scene are \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\).

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
   - Therefore, the second scene has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, Sean's lines in the second scene are \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\).

4. **Total Lines:**
   - Adding up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
   - Solo song: 54 lines
   - First scene: 36 lines
   - Second scene: 48 lines

"First, let's calculate how many cards had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

So, 32 cards had the letter A on them. This leaves us with:

\[ 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 48 cards had the letter B. Since 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

So, 24 cards had the letter B on them. This leaves us with:

\[ 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Now, we need to find out how many of the remaining 24 cards had the letter C. Since 5/8 of the rest had the letter C, we calculate:

\[ \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

So, 15 cards had the letter C on them. This leaves us with:

\[ 24 - 15 = 9 \]

Therefore, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is:

"The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 30.

**Explanation:**
- Currently, the sum of their ages is 20.
- In 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older.
- Therefore, the total additional age for both of them combined will be \(10 + 10 = 20\) years.
- Adding this to their current total age: \(20 + 20 = 30\).

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 30."
"Let's define the current ages of Ruby and Sam with variables:
- Let \( R \) be Ruby's current age.
- Let \( S \) be Sam's current age.

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.

We can translate these pieces of information into equations:
1. \( R = 6S \)
2. In 9 years, Ruby's age will be \( R + 9 \) and Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \). According to the problem, \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

Now, substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

**Final Answer:**
Sam is 6 years old."

- Peter purchased 20 popsicles.
- Each popsicle costs $0.25.
- Therefore, the total cost for the popsicles is \(20 \times 0.25 = 5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars:
- Peter purchased 4 ice cream bars.
- Each ice cream bar costs $0.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the ice cream bars is \(4 \times 0.50 = 2\) dollars.

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of popsicles + cost of ice cream bars
- Total cost = \(5 + 2 = 7\) dollars.

So, Peter paid a total of 7 dollars."
"First, determine the number of spots on a mamba. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has:

\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \text{ spots} \]

Next, calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \text{ spots} \]

Then, calculate the total number of spots for all the mambas. There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots:

"First, let's determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed:

\[ \text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover 480 miles. We use the formula for time, which is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ \boxed{16 \text{ hours}} \]"
"First, let's determine how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, Izzy has:

\[ 22 - 5 = 17 \text{ medals} \]

Next, we find the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ 22 + 17 = 39 \text{ medals} \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals they have together. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times 39 \]

Calculating the right side of the equation:

\[ 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars per packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the adults will get:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars per adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Since there are 8 children, we divide the remaining chocolate bars equally among them:

\[ 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \div 8 \text{ children} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars per child} \]

Each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"First, let's calculate the total time Susan works without breaks. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours.

Next, we need to account for her 30-minute break. Subtracting the break time from the total time gives us the actual working time:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, convert the working time into minutes:
\[ 2.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Susan earns $5 for every 10 minutes of work. To find out how much she earns in 150 minutes, we first determine how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:
\[ \frac{150 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 15 \text{ intervals} \]

Since she earns $5 per interval, her total earnings are:
\[ 15 \text{ intervals} \times \$5/\text{interval} = \$75 \]

Therefore, Susan earns \(\$75\) for the online task."
"First, let's determine the points each player has after the first three rounds:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we need to check if each player has over 20 points to see if they get an extra point in the fourth round:

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point, keeping his total at 18 points.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Now, we sum up the points of all three players after the extra points are distributed:

- Mike: 22 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 43 points

The total points are \(22 + 18 + 43 = 83\).

Final numerical answer:
83"
"First, let's determine the ages of the sons:
- The oldest son is 8 years old.
- The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so the youngest son is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) years old.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each son washes:
- The oldest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 8 oranges.
- The youngest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 4 oranges.

Now, we add the number of oranges washed by both sons:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Will originally bought 15 oranges. To find out how many are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges:
\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of oranges left unwashed is:

- \(100 + 20 = 120\) pushups
- \(50 - 10 = 40\) squats
- \(20 \times 2 = 40\) dumbbell presses

Now, let's calculate the total for each type of exercise over the two days:
- Total pushups: \(100 + 120 = 220\)
- Total squats: \(50 + 40 = 90\)
- Total dumbbell presses: \(20 + 40 = 60\)

Adding these together gives the total count of activities:
\[220 + 90 + 60 = 370\]

So, the total count of the activities he's done in the two days is:
370"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. With 5 members eating rice at each meal, the total consumption per meal is:
\[ 0.2 \, \text{kg/person} \times 5 \, \text{persons} = 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \]

Since each person eats rice at both lunch and dinner, the total daily consumption is:
\[ 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last:
\[ \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{2 \, \text{kg/day}} = 21 \, \text{days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:
\[ \frac{21 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's list the number of crates sold each day:
- Monday: Closed, so 0 crates.
- Tuesday: 15 crates.
- Wednesday: 12 crates.
- Thursday: 18 crates.
- Friday: Closed, so 0 crates.
- Saturday: 20 crates.
- Sunday: 20 crates.

Now, we sum the crates sold from Tuesday to Sunday:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 + 20 = 85 \]

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 85 = 35 \]

So, Sam was off by 35 crates from his target for the week.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"To determine the total cost of the antique desk for Carmen, we need to calculate the sequence of bids and sum them up.

1. **Initial Bid**: Carmen accepts the opening bid of $200.
2. **First Other Bidder**: The bid rises by $50, so the first other bidder bids $200 + $50 = $250.
3. **Second Other Bidder**: The bid rises by another $50, so the second other bidder bids $250 + $50 = $300.
4. **Third Other Bidder**: The bid rises by another $50, so the third other bidder bids $300 + $50 = $350.
5. **Carmen's Bid**: Carmen bids after the third other bidder, so her bid is $350 + $50 = $400.

Now, we sum up all the bids Carmen made:
- Opening bid: $200
- First bid: $250
- Second bid: $300
- Third bid: $350
- Winning bid: $400

Adding these together:
\[ 200 + 250 + 300 + 350 + 400 = 1500 \]

Thus, the total cost of the desk for Carmen is \(\boxed{1500}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total distance John travels each day. Since his work is 30 miles away and he has to go there and back, he travels:

\[ 30 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 60 \text{ miles per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance he travels in a week:

\[ 60 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 300 \text{ miles/week} \]

Then, we calculate the total distance he travels in a year:

\[ 300 \text{ miles/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 15000 \text{ miles/year} \]

Now, we calculate the cost for the miles driven in a year. He is charged $2 per mile:

\[ 15000 \text{ miles/year} \times 2 \text{ dollars/mile} = 30000 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Next, we calculate the total bonus he gives his driver. He gives a $150 bonus per month, and there are 12 months in a year:

\[ 150 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1800 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus to find the total annual cost:

\[ 30000 \text{ dollars/year} + 1800 \text{ dollars/year} = 31800 \text{ dollars/year} \]

So, the total amount John pays a year for driving is:

\[ \boxed{31800} \]"
"To find out how many minutes Peter has to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

Adding these together:
\[ 23 + 16 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined. Therefore, we need to multiply the total by 2:
\[ 39 \times 2 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Peter has to exercise for \(\boxed{78}\) minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the folding and printing process. Each piece of paper, when folded, creates 4 pages: 2 on the front and 2 on the back.

Given that a 32-page tabloid requires 4 pages per piece of paper, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper needed by dividing the total number of pages by 4.

\[
\text{Number of pieces of paper} = \frac{32 \text{ pages}}{4 \text{ pages per piece}} = 8 \text{ pieces}
\]

Therefore, 8 pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid."
"Annika spent half of her $50 on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25. She also spent an additional $10 on rides. Therefore, the total amount spent is $25 + $10 = $35. 

The amount left is $50 - $35 = $15.

**$15**"
"To find out how much money Elise earned in the second year, we need to determine how many books she sold in that year and then multiply by the price per book.

First, let's summarize the information given:
- Total books in the collection: 250
- Books sold this year: 45
- Books remaining unsold: 50
- Price per book: $20
- Books sold in the first year: twice the number sold this year

From the information, we can calculate the number of books sold in the first year:
\[ \text{Books sold in the first year} = 2 \times \text{Books sold this year} = 2 \times 45 = 90 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of books sold so far:
\[ \text{Total books sold} = \text{Books sold in the first year} + \text{Books sold this year} + \text{Books sold in the second year} \]

We know the total number of books in the collection and the number of unsold books:
\[ \text{Total books sold} = 250 - 50 = 200 \]

So, the number of books sold in the second year is:
\[ \text{Books sold in the second year} = \text{Total books sold} - \text{Books sold in the first year} - \text{Books sold this year} \]
\[ \text{Books sold in the second year} = 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year:
\[ \text{Money earned in the second year} = \text{Books sold in the second year} \times \text{Price per book} \]
\[ \text{Money earned in the second year} = 65 \times 20 = 1300 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is:
\[ \boxed{1300} \]"
"First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings:

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = \text{Hours per day} \times \text{Hourly wage} = 10 \, \text{hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$100 \]

Next, calculate his weekly earnings without the bonus:

\[ \text{Weekly earnings (without bonus)} = \text{Daily earnings} \times \text{Days per week} = \$100 \times 5 = \$500 \]

Since the company performed well for the whole month of April, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week. There are 4 weeks in April, so the total bonus for the month is:

\[ \text{Total bonus} = \text{Weekly bonus} \times \text{Weeks in April} = \$300 \times 4 = \$1200 \]

Now, calculate Watson's total earnings for the month of April:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Weekly earnings (without bonus)} \times \text{Weeks in April} + \text{Total bonus} = \$500 \times 4 + \$1200 = \$2000 + \$1200 = \$3200 \]

Therefore, Watson made \(\$3200\) in April."
"John beats 80% of the 20 people he arm wrestles. 

First, calculate how many people he beats:
\[ 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \]

Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total and beat 16 of them, the number of people he lost to is:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, John lost to 4 people."
"First, let's determine how many loaves are sold in the morning. Two-thirds of the 60 loaves are sold in the morning:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

This means that 40 loaves are sold in the morning, leaving:

\[
60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

Next, half of the remaining 20 loaves are sold in the afternoon and the other half in the evening. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"First, we determine how much weight Joey loses per week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we calculate the weekly weight loss for Joey as follows:

\[ \text{Joey's weekly weight loss} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight as Joey does in a single week, which is 2 pounds. However, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Therefore, to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds (the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks), we use the following calculation:

\[ \text{Sandy's total weight loss time} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

\[ \text{Final answer:} \]
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \]"
"First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:

- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings per tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

Now, let's calculate the savings on the milk:

- Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5

Next, we calculate the total savings for 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk:

- Total savings on ice cream: 2 tubs * $2/tub = $4
- Total savings on milk: 4 packets * $0.5/packet = $2

Finally, we add the savings from both items:

- Total savings: $4 (ice cream) + $2 (milk) = $6

You will save $6 if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk."
"To determine the number of new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many times the serum will cause the person to grow an extra arm and an extra leg within that period.

1. **Extra Arms:**
   - The serum causes an extra arm every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra arms grown is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The serum causes an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra legs grown is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs.
   - Total new limbs = 5 (extra arms) + 3 (extra legs) = 8.

After fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow a total of 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. The cost of a business suit is $100, so:
\[ 5 \times \$100 = \$500 \]
\[ \text{Flight ticket cost} = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

Now, let's add up the costs of the suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket:
\[ \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$2000 \]

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, and he has $6000 in total. Therefore, the amount he can spend on gifts is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 - \$2000 = \$2000 \]

So, Theo has to spend:
\[ \boxed{2000} \]"
"First, let's calculate the daily egg consumption for the family.

- Three people eat 3 eggs each, so that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
- The rest of the family (which is \(5 - 3 = 2\) people) eat 2 eggs each, so that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.

Adding these together, the family consumes \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs per day.

To find out how many eggs the family consumes in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

So, \(13 \times 7 = 91\) eggs.

The family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"To find Trent's age, we can set up the relationships given in the problem using variables and then solve the equations.

1. Let \( Q \) represent Quinn's age.
2. Let \( J \) represent Jane's age.
3. Let \( T \) represent Trent's age.

From the problem, we know:
- Quinn is 30 years old, so \( Q = 30 \).
- Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so \( J = Q - 3 \).
- Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so \( T = J + 5 \).

First, substitute Quinn's age into the equation for Jane's age:
\[ J = 30 - 3 = 27 \]

Next, substitute Jane's age into the equation for Trent's age:
\[ T = 27 + 5 = 32 \]

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old."
"First, let's determine Noah's age six years ago. Since Cera is currently 46 years old, six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old. According to the problem, six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. Therefore, Noah's age six years ago was \(\frac{40}{2} = 20\) years old. This means Noah is currently \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

Next, we know that six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age at that time. Since Noah was 20 years old six years ago, the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. Therefore, the current population of Chile is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

Thus, the population of Chile now is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's define the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

Final numerical answer:
30"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) people.

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Therefore, the number of people who show up for the party is the total number of people invited minus the number of people who couldn't come:

\[24 - 10 = 14\]

**Final Answer:**
14 people show up for Martha's party."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.
2. He added these to a store that already had 50 marbles.
3. His father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna.
4. Each marble weighs 2kgs.

Let's calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has:

1. Marbles bought from Johanna: 20
2. Marbles already in the store: 50
3. Marbles given by his father: \(\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8\)

Now, summing up all the marbles:
\[ 20 + 50 + 8 = 78 \]

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of the marbles is:
\[ 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kgs} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
\[ \boxed{156} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \times 5 \, \text{ft} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Given that the classroom has 30 boys, we can use the information provided to find the number of girls and nongendered children.

1. **Number of Girls:**
   - The classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys.
   - Number of girls = \(3 \times 30 = 90\).

2. **Number of Nongendered Children:**
   - The classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys.
   - Number of nongendered children = \(\frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3\).

3. **Total Number of Children:**
   - Total number of children = Number of boys + Number of girls + Number of nongendered children.
   - Total number of children = \(30 + 90 + 3 = 123\).

**Final Answer:**
123"
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up a proportion to find the number of electric poles required.

Let the number of electric poles be \( P \) and the number of electric wires be \( W \). According to the ratio, we have:
\[ P : W = 1 : 3 \]

Given \( W = 45 \), we can substitute and solve for \( P \):
\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Cross-multiplying to solve for \( P \):
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15."
"First, let's determine the total number of people at the beginning of the party:
\[ 25 \text{ men} + 15 \text{ women} = 40 \text{ people} \]

Next, we calculate how many people left after an hour. Since 1/4 of the total number of people left:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ people} \]

This means that 30 people remained at the party:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ people} \]

We know that 22 men stayed at the party. To find out how many women stayed, we subtract the number of men who stayed from the total number of people who stayed:
\[ 30 \text{ people} - 22 \text{ men} = 8 \text{ women} \]

So, the number of women left at the party is:
\[ 8 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"The book costs $4. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

The cost of the pen is $1."
"First, let's determine how many pencils are in the three boxes that Jam has. We know Jam has a total of 26 pencils, including 2 loose pencils. Therefore, the number of pencils in the three boxes is:

\[ 26 - 2 = 24 \]

Since these 24 pencils are in 3 boxes, each box contains:

\[ \frac{24}{3} = 8 \text{ pencils per box} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils and Meg has 46 pencils, so the total number of pencils is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

To find out how many boxes are needed to store all 72 pencils, assuming each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need \(\boxed{9}\) boxes to store all their pencils."
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee becomes, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the additional liquid (cream) added.

1. **Cooling Effect of Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we need:
     \[
     \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
     \]

2. **Effect of Ice Cubes on Coffee Strength:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - With 5 ice cubes, the coffee becomes:
     \[
     5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

3. **Effect of Cream:**
   - Adding 15 milliliters of cream further weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - Combining the weakening effects from the ice cubes and the cream:
     \[
     60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters weaker}
     \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( x \) as the number of old records each person brings in.
- \( y \) as the number of new records each person gets.

From the problem, we know that:
1. People can trade 2 old records for 1 new one.
2. 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records between them.

Since each person trades 2 old records for 1 new one, the number of old records each person brings in is twice the number of new records they get. Therefore, we can write:
\[ x = 2y \]

Since 5 people each get \( y \) new records, the total number of new records is:
\[ 5y = 7 \]

Solving for \( y \):
\[ y = \frac{7}{5} \]

Now, substituting \( y \) back into the equation \( x = 2y \):
\[ x = 2 \left( \frac{7}{5} \right) = \frac{14}{5} \]

Since each of the 5 people brings in \( \frac{14}{5} \) old records, the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people is:
\[ 5 \times \frac{14}{5} = 14 \]

Therefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior programmers. Given that the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, and the total number of employees is 100, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total monthly payment to all junior programmers is:

\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:

\[ 2000 + 400 = 2400 \text{ per month} \]

Thus, the total monthly payment to all senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:

\[ \text{Total payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:

\[ \boxed{224000} \]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

1. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).
2. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).
3. We know that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 6 = 20
   \]
4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 20 - 6 = 14
   \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( \boxed{14} \)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Lollipops**: Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. **Eats on the Way to School**: He eats 2 lollipops, so he has \(24 - 2 = 22\) lollipops left.
3. **Passes to Friends**: He passes 14 lollipops to his friends, so he has \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops left.
4. **Buys More Lollipops**: He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is \(2 \times 14 = 28\) lollipops. Adding these to the 8 lollipops he has left, he now has \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops.
5. **Eats More Lollipops**: He eats 3 more lollipops that night, so he has \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops left.
6. **Eats More Lollipops in the Morning**: He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning, so he has \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops left.

Therefore, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"To fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, it needs an additional 40 percentage points of charge.

Given that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to charge the remaining 40 percentage points as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes per percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ 120 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the cell phone."
"Erin initially has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her another 10 lollipops, so she then has:

\[ 7 + 10 = 17 \]

\[ 17 - 3 = 14 \]

lollipops left.

**Erin has 14 lollipops left.**"
"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

\[ \text{Rewards earned} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

On this shopping trip, the customer spent $43 and used the $4 reward. The coupon applied twice the amount of the reward, so the coupon value is:

\[ \text{Coupon value} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount after applying the reward and the coupon:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 43 - 4 - 8 = 31 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"First, let's calculate the net income for Job A:

1. **Annual Salary**: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
2. **Tax**: 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
3. **Net Income**: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Next, let's calculate the net income for Job B:

1. **Annual Salary**: $42,000
2. **Property Tax**: $6,000
3. **Net Income Before Tax**: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
4. **Tax on Net Income**: 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
5. **Net Income**: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net incomes of both jobs:

- **Job A Net Income**: $24,000
- **Job B Net Income**: $32,400

The difference in net income between the two jobs is:

$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate (Job B)."
"First, we calculate the number of ruined castles. Since 40 percent of the 220 castles are ruins, we find 40% of 220:

\[ 220 \times \frac{40}{100} = 220 \times 0.40 = 88 \]

So, there are 88 ruined castles.

Next, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. The problem states that half of the ruined castles are unmanned. Therefore, we calculate half of 88:

\[ 88 \times \frac{1}{2} = 44 \]

Thus, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is 44."

The cost difference between the two offers is $100."
"First, let's calculate the total number of paintball guns they have combined:

DJ has 8 guns,
Nick has 10 guns,
RJ (Richard) has 1 gun,
Richard has 5 guns.

Adding these together: \(8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24\) guns in total.

Next, we need to share these 24 guns equally among the 4 of them. To find out how many guns each person would get, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people:

\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

So, if they share the guns equally, each of them would have 6 guns."
"To find out how much sugar Mason needs, we can break down the problem into two parts: the sugar needed for the suckers and the sugar needed for the fudge.

1. **Sugar for suckers:**
   - Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for one batch of suckers.
   - He needs to make 8 batches of suckers.
   - Therefore, the total sugar needed for suckers is \(30 \, \text{ounces/batch} \times 8 \, \text{batches} = 240 \, \text{ounces}\).

2. **Sugar for fudge:**
   - Mason needs 70 ounces of sugar for one batch of fudge.
   - He needs to make 1 batch of fudge.
   - Therefore, the total sugar needed for fudge is \(70 \, \text{ounces/batch} \times 1 \, \text{batch} = 70 \, \text{ounces}\).

3. **Total sugar needed:**
   - Adding the sugar needed for suckers and fudge together, we get \(240 \, \text{ounces} + 70 \, \text{ounces} = 310 \, \text{ounces}\).

Therefore, Mason needs a total of 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge."
"First, let's calculate the value of the shares after the first year when the stock price increases by 50%.

1. **Initial Value of Shares:**
   Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each.
   \[
   \text{Initial Value} = 8 \times 8 = \$64
   \]

2. **Value After First Year:**
   The stock price increases by 50%.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 64 \times 0.50 = \$32
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value After First Year} = 64 + 32 = \$96

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke:
\[ 3 - 2 = 1 \]

John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke."
"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two larger groups as \( x \). Since the smallest group has 10 fewer students than each of the larger groups, the number of students in the smallest group is \( x - 10 \).

The total number of students in the class is 200, and the class is split into three groups. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

To isolate \( x \), we first add 10 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two larger groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( C \) be the number of cows.
- Let \( H \) be the number of chickens.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 60.
2. The number of chickens is twice the number of cows.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( C + H = 60 \)
2. \( H = 2C \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each:
- Total legs from cows: \( 20 \times 4 = 80 \)
- Total legs from chickens: \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \)

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:
\[ 80 + 80 = 160 \]

Therefore, the total number of legs the animals have is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Josh starts by juggling 3 balls.
2. Each week, he adds 1 more ball to his juggling act.
3. Over 4 weeks, he will add 1 ball each week:
   - After the 1st week: 3 + 1 = 4 balls
   - After the 2nd week: 4 + 1 = 5 balls
   - After the 3rd week: 5 + 1 = 6 balls
   - After the 4th week: 6 + 1 = 7 balls

So, at the end of the fourth week, Josh can juggle 7 balls.

4. During the talent show, he drops 3 balls:
   - 2 balls are caught by people in the crowd.
   - 1 ball is lost completely.

Therefore, the number of balls Josh has left to juggle is:
7 (initial number of balls) - 3 (dropped balls) + 2 (caught balls) - 1 (lost ball) = 5 balls.

So, Josh starts to juggle on stage with 5 balls."
"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad. Therefore, the blue beetle and the green toad each weigh 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake. Therefore, the yellow snake weighs \(50 + 10 = 60\) pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird. Therefore, the red bird weighs \(50 - 20 = 30\) pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself. The weights are as follows:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Adding these together, we get:
\[50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260\]

Therefore, the total weight is \(\boxed{260}\) pounds."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits.
2. At her baby shower, Laurel received twice the amount of new baby outfits that her friend gave her. So, she received \(2 \times 24 = 48\) new baby outfits.
3. Laurel's mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits.

Now, let's add up all the baby outfits Laurel has:

- From her friend: 24 outfits
- From her baby shower: 48 outfits
- From her mom: 15 outfits

Total number of baby outfits = \(24 + 48 + 15\)

Let's perform the addition:

\[24 + 48 = 72\]
\[72 + 15 = 87\]

So, the total number of baby outfits Laurel has is 87.

"First, let's calculate how many meters Tyson will run each day if he follows his coach's advice. Tyson currently runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more meters. 

To find \( \frac{1}{5} \) of 5000 meters:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

So, Tyson will run:
\[ 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters per day} \]

Next, we need to determine the total distance Tyson will run in June. June typically has 30 days. Therefore, the total distance he will run in June is:
\[ 6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180,000 \text{ meters} \]

Thus, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:

"First, let's determine the cost of each juice box:

- Juice Box A costs $4.
- Juice Box B costs $5 more than Juice Box A, so it costs $4 + $5 = $9.
- Juice Box C costs $7 more than Juice Box A, so it costs $4 + $7 = $11.

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:

$11 - $9 = $2.

So, Juice Box C is $2 more than Juice Box B."

"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Jenny's son takes for his lunch each week. Since he takes 4 cookies 5 days a week, we calculate:

\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cookies Jenny's husband eats in a week. Since he eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, we have:

\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 7 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Now, we add the cookies taken by her son and her husband to find out how many cookies are taken out of the total 36 cookies each week:

\[ 20 \text{ cookies/week} + 7 \text{ cookies/week} = 27 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Finally, to find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we subtract the total number of cookies taken by her son and husband from the total number of cookies in the bag:

\[ 36 \text{ cookies} - 27 \text{ cookies} = 9 \text{ cookies} \]

So, Jenny eats:

"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming. He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Next, he watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is:

\[ 3 \times 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let's denote the total time spent on vacation as \( T \). Therefore, we have:

\[ 0.30T = 15 \text{ hours} \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ hours}}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. So, the time spent sightseeing is:

"To solve this problem, we need to work through the steps in reverse order, starting from the information about the gumballs.

1. **Calculate the total cost of gumballs:**
   - Billy bought 40 gumballs.
   - Each gumball costs $0.05.
   - Total cost of gumballs = \( 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the amount of money Billy had before buying gumballs:**
   - He spent $2 on gumballs.
   - He took half of his change to buy gumballs.
   - Therefore, the total change he had before buying gumballs is \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the amount of money Billy had after buying candy:**
   - He started with $10.
   - He spent $4 on gumballs.
   - Therefore, the amount of money he had after buying candy is \( 10 - 4 = 6 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the amount of money spent on candy:**
   - He had $6 after buying candy.
   - The total amount he started with was $10.
   - Therefore, the amount spent on candy is \( 10 - 6 = 4 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the number of pounds of candy bought:**
   - The candy costs $1.5 per pound.
   - The amount spent on candy is $4.
   - Therefore, the number of pounds of candy bought is \( \frac{4}{1.5} = \frac{4 \times 2}{1.5 \times 2} = \frac{8}{3} \approx 2.67 \) pounds.

According to the problem, Carver is 45 years old, which is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. We can express this relationship with the following equation:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we need to solve this equation step by step.

First, add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x - 5 + 5 \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ \frac{50}{2} = \frac{2x}{2} \]
\[ 25 = x \]

So, Carver's son is \( 25 \) years old.

Therefore, the age of Carver's son is 25 years."
"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles.
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles.
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: \(75 + 100 - 50 = 125\) miles.

So, the total distance for one trip is:
\[ 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance traveled is:
\[ 300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles/day} \]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily distance:
\[ \frac{18000}{900} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the train goes 20 days between services."
"First, let's determine the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed. The problem states that a bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed.

The amount of stuffing for a Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds, and for a chihuahua bed, it is 2 pounds. The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:

\[
4 \text{ beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per bed} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:

\[
3 \text{ beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per bed} = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the amounts of stuffing needed for the chihuahua and collie beds to find the total amount of stuffing needed:

\[
8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is:

\[
\boxed{23}

\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time for the trip is \(\boxed{6}\) hours."
"To find out how many fourth-grade boys were at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of fourth-grade boys at the school.
2. Subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

First, we know the total number of fourth-graders is 96, and 43 of them are girls. Therefore, the number of boys is:
\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

On Friday, 4 fourth-grade boys were absent. So, the number of boys present on Friday is:
\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

Thus, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is:
\[ \boxed{49} \]"
"If there are 6 girls in the park and there are twice the number of boys, then there are \(6 \times 2 = 12\) boys in the park.

"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass, we need to calculate the total points she has already scored and then find out how many more points she needs to reach the required 42 points.

1. Jane's score on the first test: 15 points
2. Jane's score on the second test: 18 points

First, we add the points from the first and second tests:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Next, we need to find out how many more points are required to reach the total of 42 points:
\[ 42 - 33 = 9 \]

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on her third test to pass. 

The minimum number of points she must score on the third test to pass is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"Let's define the variables for the problem:
- Let \( x \) be the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
- According to the problem, \( x = 3 \).

Next, we calculate the number of people kicked out for shoplifting:
- The number of shoplifters is given as four times the number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks minus 5.
- Therefore, the number of shoplifters is \( 4x - 5 \).
- Substituting \( x = 3 \), we get \( 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \).

Now, we calculate the number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale:
- The number of people kicked out for physical violence is three times the number of shoplifters.
- Therefore, the number of people kicked out for physical violence is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

We know the total number of people kicked out is 50. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + (4x - 5) + 3(4x - 5) = 50 \]

Substituting \( x = 3 \) into the equation:
\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

This means that the total number of people kicked out for the specified reasons is 31. Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is \(\boxed{19}\)."
"First, let's determine how many points Erin has now. According to the problem, after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara. Sara has scored 8 points.

If we let \( E \) be the number of points Erin had before scoring the additional 14 points, then after scoring 14 points, Erin's total points are \( E + 14 \).

The problem states that after scoring these 14 points, Erin has three times the points that Sara has. Since Sara has 8 points, three times Sara's points is \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \).

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ E + 14 = 24 \]

To find \( E \), we subtract 14 from both sides of the equation:
\[ E = 24 - 14 \]
\[ E = 10 \]

Therefore, Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points.

**Final numerical answer:**

"To find out how much Ethan would save by making his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate 20% of the $400 cost.

First, calculate 20% of $400:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 400 = \frac{20}{100} \times 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

So, Ethan saves $80 by making his own wallpaper.

Now, subtract the savings from the original cost to find the total cost of making it himself:
\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday, which is:
\[ 14 \times 2 = 28 \text{ pairs} \]

On the last day of the sale, they sold one-half the amount that they did on Saturday, which is:
\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ pairs} \]

However, six pairs were returned because they didn't fit, so the actual number of pairs sold on the last day is:
\[ 14 - 6 = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

To find the total number of pairs sold over the three days, we add the pairs sold each day:
\[ 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \text{ pairs} \]

Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is:
\[ 50 \times 2 = 100 \text{ shoes} \]

Therefore, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is:
\[ 100 \]"
"To find out how many hours Hallie had dance practice in a week, we need to add up the hours from each day she practiced.

1. On Tuesdays, she had dance practice for 1 hour.
2. On Thursdays, she had dance practice for 2 hours.
3. On Saturdays, her practice lasted twice as long as on Tuesdays, which means it was 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

"First, let's determine how many pupils like blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we calculate:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, 20 pupils like blue. This leaves:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

pupils who do not like blue. Out of these remaining 20 pupils, one-fourth likes green. So, the number of pupils who like green is:

\[ \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of pupils who like yellow is the remaining pupils after accounting for those who like blue and green:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

So, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's determine how many apples Lucy sold on Monday. Since she sold the apples at $4 per piece and made $56, we can calculate the number of apples sold on Monday as follows:

\[
\text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{\$56}{\$4 \text{ per apple}} = 14 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, we know that on Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is:

\[
\text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days by adding the apples picked on each day:

\[
\text{Total number of apples} = \text{Apples picked on Monday} + \text{Apples picked on Tuesday} + \text{Apples picked on Wednesday}
\]
\[
\text{Total number of apples} = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50

\[ 65 - 44 = 21 \]

Therefore, the number of cookies left for Rachel is 21."
"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the interest for five months. The formula for simple interest is:

\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $3,650, the rate (R) is 10% or 0.10, and the time (T) is 5/12 years (since the loan is for 5 months).

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 152.085 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.085 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3802.085 \]

Now, to find out how much she has to pay per month, we divide the total amount by the number of months (5):

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.085}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.417 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.42 \]

So, Karan has to pay $760.42 per month."
"To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked and then subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Cho hiked = 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 kilometers

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Chloe hiked = 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 kilometers

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
Difference = Distance Cho hiked - Distance Chloe hiked
Difference = 112 kilometers - 45 kilometers = 67 kilometers

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"First, let's determine the number of silver and gold pesos Anna has.

- Axel has 50 silver pesos. Since Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, Anna has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos.
- Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so Anna has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Next, we calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos Axel and Anna have together.

- Total silver pesos: Axel's 50 silver pesos + Anna's 100 silver pesos = \(50 + 100 = 150\) silver pesos.
- Total gold pesos: Axel's 80 gold pesos + Anna's 120 gold pesos = \(80 + 120 = 200\) gold pesos.

Finally, we add the total number of silver and gold pesos to find the total number of pesos they have together.

- Total number of pesos: \(150 + 200 = 350\).

The total number of pesos they have together is 350."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she has 3 pitchers, the total number of cups is:
\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:
\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the supplies, which is $18.

The profit from selling all the lemonade is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she sells all 36 cups, the time it takes to sell all the lemonade is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the total hours it takes to sell all the lemonade:
\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

Therefore, the profit Millie makes per hour is:
\[ \$2 \]"
"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther originally had, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther originally had as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. This remaining land is given as 12.8 hectares.

So, we can write the equation as:
\[ \frac{2}{5} x = 12.8 \]

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \). We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):
\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]

Now, we perform the multiplication:
\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]
\[ x = 32 \]

So, Mr. Ruther originally had 32 hectares of land.

32"
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 52 \times 0.5 = 26 \]

On the day of the performance, only the female members are performing. So, initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform.

However, half of the performers can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

\[ \text{Number of girls who can't make it} = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

So, the number of girls who actually perform is:

\[ \text{Number of girls who perform} = 26 - 13 = 13 \]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[ \text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16 \]

"First, let's calculate the cost for Dasha if she buys tickets for all 9 rides.

Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2. Therefore, the cost per ride is:
\[ 2 \text{ tickets/ride} \times \$2 \text{ per ticket} = \$4 \text{ per ride} \]

For 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is:
\[ 9 \text{ rides} \times \$4 \text{ per ride} = \$36 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost for David if he buys a ride bracelet.

The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides. Therefore, the total cost for David is:
\[ \$30 \]

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract the cost of the bracelet from the cost of buying individual tickets for Dasha:
\[ \$36 - \$30 = \$6 \]

So, David saves:

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

First, we need to find the total parts of the ratio:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

This means the total number of popsicles (165) is divided into 11 parts. To find the value of one part, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus after the 20% discount for bundling.

The normal cost for Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so together they cost:
\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per month} \]

With a 20% discount, the cost is reduced by 20%, so he pays 80% of the original cost:
\[ 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, let's add the cost of Netflix to the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus:
\[ 10 + 16 = 26 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Tim's original cable subscription cost $60 per month. By switching to the streaming services, he pays $26 per month. The amount of money he saves per month is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of Valentine's cards Erica initially had:

1. Erica made 20 cards.
2. Her dad brought 2 boxes with 15 cards each, so \(2 \times 15 = 30\) cards.

Adding these together, Erica initially had \(20 + 30 = 50\) cards.

Next, let's account for the cards she passed out and received:

1. She passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
2. She passed out 5 cards to her family.
3. She received 17 cards from family and friends.

So, the total number of cards she gave away is \(24 + 5 = 29\).

Now, let's calculate the net number of cards Erica has:

1. Initial cards: 50
2. Cards given away: 29
3. Cards received: 17

The net number of cards Erica has is \(50 - 29 + 17 = 38\).

Therefore, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards."
"First, let's determine how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Next, Jenny gives \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pizza to Mark. Again, since the pizza has 12 slices:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of slices given away:
\[ 4 \text{ slices (to Bill)} + 3 \text{ slices (to Mark)} = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices, so we subtract these from the total slices given away:
\[ 7 \text{ slices} + 2 \text{ slices (eaten by Jenny)} = 9 \text{ slices} \]

Finally, we subtract the 9 slices from the original 12 slices to find out how many slices are left:
\[ 12 \text{ slices} - 9 \text{ slices} = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the number of slices left is:
\[ 3 \]"
"To determine how many days Mark needs to save enough money to buy a bike that costs $300, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Mark needs to save: $300 (cost of the bike) - $50 (initial amount in the bank) = $250.
2. Determine how many days it will take for Mark to save $250 if he earns $10 per day: $250 / $10 per day = 25 days.

Therefore, Mark needs to save for 25 days to have enough money to buy the bike.

25 days"
"First, let's determine the number of millipedes Nancy saw. Since she saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, and she saw 90 spiders, the number of millipedes is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \]

Next, we need to find out how many stink bugs she saw. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. Since she saw 30 millipedes, the number of stink bugs is:

\[ 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \]

Now, we add up all the bugs she saw: spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs. The total number of bugs is:

\[ 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 \]

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is:

\[ \boxed{168} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:
\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we determine how long it will take Toby to read the book at his reading rate of 300 words per minute:
\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby needs to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 10 minutes to get there. Therefore, he needs to finish reading the book 10 minutes before his departure time:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Since it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, we can find out how many minutes early he will be:
\[ 50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Toby will be \(\boxed{20}\) minutes early."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total payment for May:**
   - Number of employees in May: 40
   - Payment per employee per hour: $15
   - Hours worked per week: 40
   - Total payment for May = Number of employees × Payment per employee per hour × Hours worked per week
   \[
   \text{Total payment for May} = 40 \times 15 \times 40 = 24000
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of employees in June:**
   - 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired in June.
   - Number of employees who left = \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\)
   - Number of employees remaining in June = 40 - 10 = 30

3. **Calculate the total payment for June:**
   - Number of employees in June: 30
   - Payment per employee per hour: $15
   - Hours worked per week: 40
   - Total payment for June = Number of employees × Payment per employee per hour × Hours worked per week

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. So, the first pound of taffy costs $3, and the second pound is half off, which means it costs $3 / 2 = $1.50. Therefore, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50, and the magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1.00. So, the total cost for the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1.00 = $2.50.

Now, we add up the total cost of all the items Sally bought: $4.50 (taffy) + $2.50 (seashells and magnets) = $7.00.

Sally started with $10. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is $10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

Therefore, Sally has $3.00 left."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the second pack of fireworks. Since it's worth twice the amount of the first pack, we multiply $400 by 2:

\[ 400 \times 2 = 800 \]

So, the second pack of fireworks costs $800.

Next, we add the cost of the first pack and the second pack to find the total cost before the discount:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Now, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the fireworks. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the original price. We calculate 80% of $1200:

\[ 1200 \times 0.80 = 960 \]

So, the cost of the fireworks after the discount is $960.

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted total:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. To find out how many cookies she needs for 30 days, we multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of days:

\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies she needs to make 60 cookies:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days. 

**Final Answer:**
5 dozens"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the probabilities of two independent events: a candle exploding and a candle smelling like wet dog.

1. The probability that a candle explodes is 1% (since 99% guaranteed not to explode means 1% chance of exploding).
2. The probability that a candle smells like wet dog is 5%.

Since these events are independent, the probability that both events occur (a candle both smells like wet dog and explodes) is the product of their individual probabilities.

\[ \text{Probability of both events} = 0.01 \times 0.05 = 0.0005 \]

Now, to find out how many of the 50,000 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode, we multiply the total number of candles by this probability:

\[ 50000 \times 0.0005 = 25 \]

Therefore, 25 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode."
"First, calculate the discount price of each blouse. The discount is 30%, so the price after the discount is 70% of the original price.

\[ \text{Discounted price per blouse} = 20 \times (1 - 0.30) = 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \]

Next, calculate the total cost for 4 blouses at the discounted price.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"Let's define the variables for the number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister from each type of tree:

- Let \( J_t \) be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees.
- Let \( J_s \) be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the shortest trees.
- Let \( J_a \) be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.
- Let \( S_t \) be the number of apples Joanne's sister gathers from the tallest trees.
- Let \( S_s \) be the number of apples Joanne's sister gathers from the shortest trees.

From the problem, we know:
1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so \( J_t = 30 \).
2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, so \( J_s = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).
3. Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so \( S_t = 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
4. Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so \( S_s = 3 \times 15 = 45 \).
5. Joanne's sister gathers no apples from the average trees, so \( S_a = 0 \).
6. The combined total of apples gathered by both is 500.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister can be expressed as:
\[ J_t + J_s + J_a + S_t + S_s + S_a = 500 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 30 + 15 + J_a + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 150 + J_a = 500 \]

Solving for \( J_a \):
\[ J_a = 500 - 150 \]
\[ J_a = 350 \]

Therefore, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees."
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( c \) be the number of camels.
- Let \( d \) be the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we can set up the following system of equations based on the given information:
1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 180:
\[ c + d = 180 \]

2. The total number of humps is 304, with camels having 2 humps each and dromedaries having 1 hump each:
\[ 2c + d = 304 \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
\[ \begin{cases} 
c + d = 180 \\
2c + d = 304 
\end{cases} \]

To solve for \( c \) and \( d \), we can use the method of elimination. First, we subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( d \):
\[ (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2c + d - c - d = 124 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Now that we have \( c = 124 \), we substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[ 124 + d = 180 \]
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( \boxed{56} \)."
"First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days:
\[ 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \]

Next, we calculate the distance he traveled over the next two days, which is 30% of the distance traveled in the first four days:
\[ 800 \text{ km} \times 0.30 = 240 \text{ km} \]

On the following day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is:
\[ 0 \text{ km} \]

For the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days:
\[ 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \]

Now, we sum up all the distances:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:

"Given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4.

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.

\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"Stanley's comb fell from an elevation of 10,000 feet to a ledge at 6,000 feet (since it fell 4,000 feet from 10,000 feet). Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, Oliver must climb the difference between 6,000 feet and 3,000 feet.

The calculation is:
\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To determine how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money given by the second bank.
2. Add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital.

First, the second bank gave Mr. Josue twice as much as the first bank. Since the first bank gave $4000, the second bank gave:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, the total capital Mr. Josue has now is:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"

"First, let's determine the sale price of the jogger jeans. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, and the tattered jeans cost $28, the sale price of the jogger jeans is:
\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find the original price of the jogger jeans. Let the original price of the jogger jeans be \( x \). Since the jogger jeans are now on sale for $22, the discount on the jogger jeans is:
\[ x - 22 \]

The total savings from both pairs of jeans is $6. According to the problem, Cole saved \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]
And the savings from the tattered jeans is:
\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

The savings from the tattered jeans is the difference between the original price and the sale price, which is $28 - 28 + 4 = 4$ dollars. This means the original price of the tattered jeans is:
\[ 28 + 4 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we know the original price of the jogger jeans is \( x \) and the savings from the jogger jeans is \( x - 22 = 2 \). Solving for \( x \):
\[ x - 22 = 2 \]
\[ x = 24 \]

So, the original price of the jogger jeans is $24. The difference between the original price of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is:
\[ 32 - 24 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 more than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum these capacities.

1. **Buses:**
   - Number of buses: 4
   - Capacity per bus: 60 employees
   - Total capacity for buses: \( 4 \times 60 = 240 \) employees

2. **Minibusses:**
   - Number of minibusses: 6
   - Capacity per minibus: 30 employees
   - Total capacity for minibusses: \( 6 \times 30 = 180 \) employees

3. **Minivans:**
   - Number of minivans: 10
   - Capacity per minivan: 15 employees
   - Total capacity for minivans: \( 10 \times 15 = 150 \) employees

Now, we sum the capacities of all the vehicles to find the total number of employees that can join the day trip:

\[
240 \text{ (buses)} + 180 \text{ (minibusses)} + 150 \text{ (minivans)} = 570 \text{ employees}
\]

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is **570**."
"First, let's determine the number of birds attracted by each type of bird feeder. Each store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds, and each bird feeder Lillian builds attracts 10 more birds than a store-bought one, so each homemade bird feeder attracts \(20 + 10 = 30\) birds.

Next, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought bird feeders. Lillian buys 3 store-bought bird feeders, so the total number of birds attracted by these feeders is \(3 \times 20 = 60\).

Then, we calculate the total number of birds attracted by the homemade bird feeders. Lillian builds 3 homemade bird feeders, so the total number of birds attracted by these feeders is \(3 \times 30 = 90\).

Finally, we add the number of birds attracted by the store-bought bird feeders and the homemade bird feeders to find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day. The total number of birds is \(60 + 90 = 150\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{150}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, which costs $4. 

To find 25% of $4:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the soup costs:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Next, the cake costs half of the price of the bagel. Since the bagel costs $4:
\[ \text{Cost of the cake} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, we add up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake to find the total cost of the dinner:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money Kenny needs to buy the ticket:**
   - The ticket costs $100.

2. **Determine the amount of money Kenny has after buying the ticket:**
   - Kenny has $50 in spending cash after buying the ticket.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Kenny made from selling the cards:**
   - Total money = Ticket cost + Spending cash
   - Total money = $100 + $50 = $150

4. **Determine the number of cards Kenny sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - Number of cards sold = Total money / Price per card
   - Number of cards sold = $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards

5. **Determine the total number of cards Kenny started with:**
   - Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells the rest.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of cards Kenny started with.
   - Number of cards sold = \( x - \frac{1}{3}x = \frac{2}{3}x \)
   - We know the number of cards sold is 100.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{2}{3}x = 100 \)
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150
     \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - Half of the guests (18 guests) were to have 2 hotdogs each.
   - Therefore, the caterer prepared \(18 \times 2 = 36\) hotdogs for these guests.

2. **Total Hotdogs Needed:**
   - The remaining half (18 guests) were to have 1 hotdog each.
   - So, the caterer prepared an additional \(18 \times 1 = 18\) hotdogs for these guests.
   - In total, the caterer prepared \(36 + 18 = 54\) hotdogs.

3. **Actual Guests and Hotdogs Needed:**
   - 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog.
   - The first hotdog for each of the 40 guests is covered by the 54 hotdogs.
   - For a second hotdog, each of the 40 guests would need an additional hotdog.
   - Therefore, 40 additional hotdogs are needed for the second hotdog.

4. **Hotdogs Shortage:**
   - The caterer had 54 hotdogs initially.
   - 40 additional hotdogs are needed for the second hotdog.
   - The shortage of hotdogs is \(40 - (54 - 36) = 40 - 18 = 22\).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since 22 hotdogs are not available, 22 guests did not get a second hotdog.

**Final Answer:**
22 guests did not get a second hotdog."
"First, let's determine the number of letters in half of Indras' name. Indras' name has 6 letters, so half of that is:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we need to find out how many letters are in her sister's name. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, so we add 4 to the 3 letters:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, to find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name:

\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is:

\[ 13 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Adding these together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165.00, we calculate:
\[ 165.00 \times 0.80 = 132.00 \]

So, the final amount of Charlotte's order is:
\[ \boxed{132.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy:

- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Dora has:

- Saved from allowance: $2
- Money given by her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, to find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the total money she has from the total cost of the items:

Money needed = Total cost - Total money Dora has
Money needed = $19 - $18 = $1

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"First, let's determine how many dragons Prince Arthur slew. Since Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, and Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons, we calculate:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Next, we find out how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Finally, we need to determine how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \]

Therefore, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons."
"First, we need to determine how much gasoline each container holds. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needs in gallons. Josey needs \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons by 8 pints per gallon:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline. 

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money George had left after his purchase. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can calculate the amount of money he had left as follows:

\[ \text{Money left} = 5 \times \frac{1}{100} = 0.05 \text{ dollars} \]

This means George spent:

\[ 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we know George bought 3 bags of chips, and each bag costs 40 cents. So, the total cost for the chips is:

\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the chips from the total amount spent gives us the amount spent on candy bars:

\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, the number of candy bars George bought is:

\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

So, George bought 5 candy bars. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many lollipops Ray shared with his friends. Ray originally had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, the number of lollipops shared is:

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \]

\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \]

So, each of Ray's friends received \(\boxed{5}\) lollipops."
"Rory's cake initially weighs 20 ounces. She cuts it into 8 pieces, so each piece weighs:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} \]

Rory and her mom each have one piece, so they have consumed:

\[ 2.5 \text{ ounces} + 2.5 \text{ ounces} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the remaining weight of the cake is:

\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have together:

Sitti has 34 oranges, and Juris has 22 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is:
\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people to find out how many oranges each person will get:
\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, each person will get:
\[ \boxed{7} \] oranges."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine will use. He doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. Therefore, he will use:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound, so the cost for 4 pounds is:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is on sale for $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock is:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Adding the cost of the onions and the beef stock gives us the total cost:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Therefore, the cost per serving is:

\[ \$2.00 \]"
"First, we need to determine the time it takes Bernadette to drive to the theater. According to the problem, the drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel. Since Wayne’s drive takes 4 minutes, Bernadette’s drive will take:

\[ 4 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. If Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before that, which means she needs to arrive 9 minutes before Wayne starts his drive. Since Bernadette’s drive takes 16 minutes, she needs to leave 16 minutes before the time Wayne leaves to ensure she arrives 9 minutes before Wayne.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 16 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ 16 \text{ minutes} \]"
"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can find the width by rearranging the formula:
\[ \text{width} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{length}} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:
\[ 98 \text{ feet} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought:

- Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads.
- Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 3 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 3 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ pieces per pack} = 60 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought:

- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.
- Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 7 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 7 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ pieces per pack} = 140 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other:

\[ 140 \text{ pieces} - 60 \text{ pieces} = 80 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking**: Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour.
   - Temperature increase per hour = 5 degrees
   - Total time baking = 3 hours
   - Total temperature increase = 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees
   - New temperature after baking = 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

3. **Cooling**: Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   - Cooling rate = 2 degrees/10 minutes
   - Total time the window is open = 30 minutes
   - Total cooling = (2 degrees/10 minutes) * 30 minutes = 6 degrees
   - Final temperature = 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

The house's final temperature is 49 degrees."
"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time James took for the swim is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. So, the time James took for the bike is:
\[ 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( x \) be the time James took for the run. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, the total time for James is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

So, the time James took for the run is 59 minutes."
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is equal to \(1.25 \times 60 = 75\) minutes.

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B is \(75 + 5 = 80\) minutes.

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. So, the length of Movie A is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20\) minutes.

Therefore, Movie A is 20 minutes long."
"First, let's determine how far Michael's horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

1. Convert 30 minutes to hours:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} = \frac{30}{60} \text{ hours} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \]

2. Calculate the distance the horse runs:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how much hay the horse eats for running 16 miles. The horse eats \(\frac{1}{2}\) a bail of hay per mile.

3. Calculate the total hay consumed:
\[ \text{Hay consumed} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bale/mile} = 8 \text{ bales} \]

Now, we need to determine the cost of the hay. Each bail of hay costs $3.

4. Calculate the total cost of the hay:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \text{ bales} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bale} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

5. Calculate the change after buying the hay:

- She uses 4 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs.
- She also has 2 additional eggs.

So, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Since each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs, the number of glasses she can make is:

\[
\frac{50 \text{ eggs}}{5 \text{ eggs per glass}} = 10 \text{ glasses}
\]

Since each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, the number of trays Rozanne can put out is:

Joey is now winning by 5 points."
"First, let's calculate the cost per sneaker:
\[ \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{\$576}{48} = \$12 \]

Next, we calculate the revenue from the flash sale:
\[ \text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \times \$20 = \$340 \]

Now, we determine how many sneakers were sold to the department store:
\[ \text{Sneakers sold to department store} = 48 - 17 = 31 \]

Then, we calculate the revenue from the department store:
\[ \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times \$25 = \$775 \]

Adding the revenues from both sales gives the total revenue:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = \$340 + \$775 = \$1115 \]

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \text{Profit} = \$1115 - \$576 = \$539 \]

Therefore, the salesman's profit is:
\[ \$539 \]"

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( P \) be the regular price of popcorn.

The cost of a super ticket with popcorn and soda is:
\[ 20 + 1 = 21 \]

The cost of a regular movie ticket, popcorn, and soda is:
\[ 12 + P + 3 \]

According to the problem, buying the regular ticket and items separately cost $2 less than buying the super ticket. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 21 - 2 \]

Simplify the right side of the equation:
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 19 \]

Combine like terms on the left side:
\[ 15 + P = 19 \]

Subtract 15 from both sides to solve for \( P \):
\[ P = 19 - 15 \]
\[ P = 4 \]

So, the regular price of popcorn is \( \boxed{4} \)."
"First, we need to determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the initial day. Given that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900, we can find the cost per balloon by dividing the total cost by the number of balloons:

\[
\text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[
\text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for filling 170 balloons at the new price. We do this by multiplying the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons:

\[
\text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 65 \times 170
\]

To find the product, we perform the multiplication:

\[
65 \times 170 = 65 \times (100 + 70) = (65 \times 100) + (65 \times 70) = 6500 + 4550 = 11050
\]

Thus, the total cost for Bentley to fill 170 balloons after the price increase is:

\[
\boxed{11050}

"To find the car's average speed during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then use the formula for average speed:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

First, calculate the distance for each segment of the trip:

1. For the first segment:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

2. For the second segment:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time}_2 = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, calculate the total distance:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, calculate the total time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_1 + \text{Time}_2 = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

Finally, calculate the average speed:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph} \]

The car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."

"First, calculate the volume of one raised bed:
\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, calculate the total volume for all 10 raised beds:
\[ \text{Total volume} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Now, determine how many bags of potting soil are needed. Each bag holds 2 cubic feet:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Finally, calculate the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times \$12/\text{bag} = \$1920 \]

The potting soil will cost Bob \$1920."
"First, let's calculate the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can find the number of green cards by calculating 60% of the number of red cards and then adding that to the number of red cards.

Number of red cards = 15

60% of 15 = 0.60 * 15 = 9

So, the number of green cards = 15 (red cards) + 9 (60% more) = 24

Next, we need to find the number of yellow cards. According to the problem, the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards.

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24 = 39

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards together.

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

Therefore, the total number of cards is 78."
"Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.

After twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw, which is:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]
These 25 fairies joined the 50 fairies already there, so the total number of fairies became:
\[ 50 + 25 = 75 \]

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. So, the number of fairies remaining is:
\[ 75 - 30 = 45 \]

Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

Total number of puppies = 8 (Jennifer's) + 12 (Brandon's) = 20 puppies

Total number of puppies with spots = 3 (Jennifer's) + 4 (Brandon's) = 7 puppies

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

Therefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed the farmer is buying:

1. **Sugar Cubes**: 2 boxes at 1 pound each
   \[
   2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Carrots**: 4 bags at 12 pounds each
   \[
   4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Hay**: 42 bales at 75 pounds each
   \[
   42 \times 75 = 3150 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Oats**: 20 sacks at 65 pounds each
   \[
   20 \times 65 = 1300 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we sum up the total weight of all the feed:
\[
2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips the farmer needs, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since a fraction of a trip is not possible):
\[
\frac{4500}{2250} = 2
\]

Therefore, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."
"First, let's calculate how much Grayson earns from recycling aluminum cans in a week. She recycles three aluminum cans, and each can is worth two cents. So, the weekly earnings from cans are:
\[ 3 \text{ cans} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from recycling plastic bottles in a week. She recycles five plastic bottles, and each bottle is worth three cents. So, the weekly earnings from bottles are:
\[ 5 \text{ bottles} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents} \]

Now, let's find out how much she earns in total from recycling both cans and bottles in a week:
\[ 6 \text{ cents} + 15 \text{ cents} = 21 \text{ cents} \]

Since we need to find out how much she earns in a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:
\[ 21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 84 \text{ cents} \]"
"First, let's determine how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we calculate 60% of 10:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 10 = 0.60 \times 10 = 6 \]

So, Toni has:

\[ 10 + 6 = 16 \text{ plants} \]

Next, we need to find out how many plants Shondra has. Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. Since Toni has 16 plants, Shondra has:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \text{ plants} \]

Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants."
"Leila gave Ali half of her $100, which is $50. 

Ali originally had $21.

"First, we need to calculate the tip amount, which is 1/5 of the pizza delivery cost.

The cost of the pizza is $15. 

The tip amount is calculated as:
\[ \text{Tip} = \frac{1}{5} \times 15 = 3 \]

Now, we add the tip to the cost of the pizza to find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Cost of Pizza} + \text{Tip} = 15 + 3 = 18 \]

Therefore, the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man is $18."
"Finley started in first place. Let's track her movements:

1. She fell back 5 spots: \(1 - 5 = -4\). Since she can't be in a negative spot, we adjust this to the last possible positive spot, which is 1 (since she can't be in a negative spot, she is now in 1st place again after wrapping around).
2. She then moved ahead 2 spots: \(1 + 2 = 3\). So, she is now in 3rd place.
3. She fell behind 3 spots: \(3 - 3 = 0\). Again, since she can't be in 0th place, she is now in 1st place.
4. Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot: \(1 + 1 = 2\). So, she is now in 2nd place.

Therefore, Finley finished the race in 2nd place. 

**Final answer: 2nd place.**"
"First, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has:

\[ 6 \text{ decks} \times 25 \text{ cards/deck} = 150 \text{ basketball cards} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of baseball cards:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 40 \text{ cards/box} = 200 \text{ baseball cards} \]

Now, let's find the total number of cards Miss Maria has:

\[ 150 \text{ basketball cards} + 200 \text{ baseball cards} = 350 \text{ cards} \]

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is:

\[ 350 \text{ cards} - 50 \text{ cards} = 300 \text{ cards} \]

If each student gets 10 cards, the number of students Miss Maria has is:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ cards}}{10 \text{ cards/student}} = 30 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students."
"First, let's calculate how much Becky paid for her apples.

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each:
\[ 20 \times 0.45 = 9.00 \text{ dollars} \]

After receiving a $1 discount, Becky paid:
\[ 9.00 - 1.00 = 8.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for her apples.

Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Kelly received a 10 percent discount on her total purchase. The discount amount is:
\[ 10.00 \times 0.10 = 1.00 \text{ dollar} \]

So, after the discount, Kelly paid:
\[ 10.00 - 1.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky:
\[ 9.00 - 8.00 = 1.00 \text{ dollar} \]

Therefore, Kelly paid $1.00 more than Becky."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of each type of laundry per room:**
   - Each room has 2 sheets.
   - Each room has 1 comforter.
   - Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pillow cases.
   - Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so \(2 \times 4 = 8\) towels.

2. **Sum up the total number of pieces of laundry per room:**
   - Sheets: 2
   - Comforters: 1
   - Pillow cases: 4
   - Towels: 8
   - Total per room: \(2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15\)

"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.
2. On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since 1 pair equals 2 shoes, 5 pairs equal 10 shoes. So, he now has:
   \[
   200 + 10 = 210 \text{ shoes}
   \]
3. On Wednesday, he gains 15 pairs of shoes, which is:
   \[
   15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ shoes}
   \]
   Adding these to his current total:
   \[
   210 + 30 = 240 \text{ shoes}
   \]
4. On Friday, he gains 30 pairs of shoes, which is:
   \[
   30 \times 2 = 60 \text{ shoes}
   \]
   Adding these to his current total:
   \[
   240 + 60 = 300 \text{ shoes}
   \]
5. On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. Subtracting these from his current total:
   \[
   300 - 180 = 120 \text{ shoes}
   \]

So, on Sunday, Fireman Frank will have:

"First, we need to determine the total number of cupcakes Mary can decorate with all her sprinkles. Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and Mary has 6 jars, we can calculate the total number of cupcakes as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ jars} \times 8 \text{ cupcakes/jar} = 48 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pans of cupcakes Mary should bake. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold:

\[ 48 \text{ cupcakes} \div 12 \text{ cupcakes/pan} = 4 \text{ pans} \]

Therefore, Mary should bake 4 pans worth of cupcakes."
"First, let's determine the cost of the piece of paper. The problem states that the piece of paper cost $1 less than three times the price of the pen. The pen costs $2, so three times the price of the pen is:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Since the piece of paper costs $1 less than this amount, the cost of the piece of paper is:

\[ 6 - 1 = 5 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the pen and the piece of paper:

\[ 2 + 5 = 7 \]

Theo gave the cashier $10. To find the change Theo received, we subtract the total cost from the amount given:

\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of pencils at the start of the year. Since there are 30 students and each student started with 10 pencils, the total number of pencils is:
\[ 30 \times 10 = 300 \]

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. So, the number of pencils used is:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of pencils remaining after two months is:
\[ 300 - 60 = 240 \]

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. So, the number of pencils left is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80 \]

Thus, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, so we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 6 inches to feet by dividing by 12:

\[ 6 \text{ inches} = \frac{6}{12} \text{ feet} = 0.5 \text{ feet} \]

Benny has 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:

\[ 2 \times 0.5 \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

Next, we need to find what percentage 1 foot is of the shark's body length, which is 10 feet. The formula to find the percentage is:

\[ \left( \frac{\text{part}}{\text{whole}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[ \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"
"Let's denote the total number of students at that grade level as \( x \).

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have desktop computers. This means that one-fourth of the students do not have desktop computers. We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{4}x = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 4:
\[
x = 20 \times 4 = 80

So, each child received 5 books."
"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find out how many kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both.

Let's define:
- \( D \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( P \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

From the problem, we know:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

The number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both is given by:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

This means 12 kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - |D \cup P| = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to calculate the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides, then add these two numbers together.

First, we calculate the total number of employees:
- There are 3 groups.
- Each group has 200 employees.

So, the total number of employees is:
\[ 3 \times 200 = 600 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of tour guides:
- Each group has 7 tour guides.
- There are 3 groups.

So, the total number of tour guides is:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we add the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides to find the total number of people going on the tour:
\[ 600 + 21 = 621 \]

Therefore, the total number of people going on the tour is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel during the busy weekend. The normal price is $1500 per day, and it is 20% more expensive during the busy weekend.

The increase in price is:
\[ 1500 \times 0.20 = 300 \]

So, the cost per day during the busy weekend is:
\[ 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Each ticket costs $5000, and since there are two tickets, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the trip is:
\[ \boxed{15400} \]"

"To find out how much more Keegan and Tashay needed to earn to reach their goal, we first need to calculate the total amount they had earned by 3 pm.

Keegan had earned $83 and Tasha had earned $91. Adding these amounts together:

\[ 83 + 91 = 174 \]

They needed to raise a total of $200. To find out how much more they needed to earn, we subtract the amount they had already earned from their goal:

\[ 200 - 174 = 26 \]

So, they needed to earn \(\boxed{26}\) more dollars to reach their goal."
"First, let's determine how many songs Luri has on her player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

So, Luri has 60 songs on her player.

Next, we need to find out how many songs each can still add to their players. Since each player can store up to 100 songs:

- Gabriel can add:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]
- Luri can add:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:

\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Therefore, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to her player than Gabriel can add to his."
"First, we need to determine how many oranges Stetson ate. Since he ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 oranges they picked, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. Since he gives up $10 for each orange he eats, the total amount of money he gave up is:

\[
24 \times 10 = 240
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is \(\boxed{240}\)."

"First, calculate the total miles James runs in a week:

\[ 12 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 60 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, since he runs at a pace of 10 miles per hour, we can find the total hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles by his speed:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, James runs a total of 6 hours a week."
"To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the daily consumption of oats for one horse:**
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, the daily consumption for one horse is \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).

2. **Calculate the daily consumption of oats for all four horses:**
   - Since there are four horses, the total daily consumption is \(10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).

3. **Calculate the total consumption of oats for five days:**
   - The total consumption over five days is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).

4. **Determine the number of bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.
   - The number of bags required is \(\frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags}\).

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs **4 bags** of oats to feed his horses for five days."
"First, we calculate the number of Pomeranians Jana has. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 27 = 18
\]

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians.

Next, we need to find out how many of these Pomeranians are girls. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
\]

Therefore, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

\[
\text{Number of girl Pomeranians} = 6

"To find the average highest temperature of the three countries, we first need to sum the highest temperatures of each country and then divide by the number of countries.

The highest temperatures are:
- Southlandia: -48 degrees Fahrenheit
- Northlandia: 21 degrees Fahrenheit
- Midlandia: -3 degrees Fahrenheit

First, we sum these temperatures:
\[
-48 + 21 + (-3) = -48 + 21 - 3 = -30
\]

Next, we divide the sum by the number of countries, which is 3:
\[
\frac{-30}{3} = -10

\[ 8 + 24 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Sally spends a total of $32."
"First, let's calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors before any discounts:

- Each pack costs $4.00.
- Therefore, 2 packs cost \(2 \times \$4.00 = \$8.00\).

Next, we apply the ""buy one get one free"" promotion. Since Heather is buying 2 packs, she gets the second pack free. So, she only pays for 1 pack:

- Cost for 1 pack = \$4.00.

Now, we apply the $2.00 coupon to the reduced price:

- Reduced price after coupon = \$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00.

Heather is buying 2 packs, which is 8 razors in total. The cost for 8 razors is \$2.00. To find the cost per razor:

- Cost per razor = \(\frac{\$2.00}{8} = \$0.25\).

Converting this to cents:

- Cost per razor in cents = \(0.25 \times 100 = 25\) cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor is 25 cents."
"First, we need to determine the height of the shortest cheerleader, which is 60 inches. In a human pyramid, the shortest cheerleader is at the top. The height of the human pyramid will be the height of this single cheerleader since no other cheerleaders are stacked on top of her.

The height of the human pyramid is 60 inches.

To convert this height into feet, we use the conversion factor that 1 foot = 12 inches.

\[ \text{Height in feet} = \frac{60 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the human pyramid is 5 feet."
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour. Since she works for 8 hours each day, she walks:

\[ 5 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \]

After 5 days, the total time she has walked is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, after 5 days at the office, Charisma has walked 200 minutes."
"Let's denote Angela's current age as \( A \).

According to the problem, in four years, Brett will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old. At that time, Angela will be three times Brett's current age. Brett's current age is 14, so three times his current age is \( 3 \times 14 = 42 \).

In four years, Angela's age will be \( A + 4 \). We can set up the equation based on the information given:

\[ A + 4 = 42 \]

To find Angela's current age, we solve for \( A \):

\[ A = 42 - 4 \]
\[ A = 38 \]

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

Angela's current age is 38."
"To find out how much money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks, we need to calculate the total cost for both the morning and afternoon rides over the 14 days.

First, let's calculate the cost for the morning rides:
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- Paul drives in the morning every day for 14 days.
- Therefore, the total cost for morning rides is \( 6 \times 14 = 84 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the afternoon rides:
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- Paul drives in the afternoon every day for 14 days.
- Therefore, the total cost for afternoon rides is \( 2 \times 14 = 28 \) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs for the morning and afternoon rides to find the overall expenditure:
- Total cost for morning rides: $84
- Total cost for afternoon rides: $28
- Therefore, the total amount spent is \( 84 + 28 = 112 \) dollars.

So, Paul spent a total of $112 on driving his car during these two weeks."
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, let's find the total number of oranges both brought together:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges, we can determine the number of pies they can make by dividing the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, they can make:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To determine the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests, \( x \).

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the number of guests, \( x \), for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

To solve for \( x \), we first isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation:
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Let's define the variables for the number of insects each person found:
- Let \( L \) be the number of insects Lily found.
- Let \( D \) be the number of insects David found.
- Let \( B \) be the number of insects Bodhi found.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( L + D + B = 43 \) (The total number of insects collected)
2. \( L = D + 7 \) (Lily found 7 more than David)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \) (David found half of what Bodhi found)

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \) using the third equation:
\[ B = 2D \]

Next, we substitute \( L \) and \( B \) in terms of \( D \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]
\[ 4D = 36 \]
\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know \( D = 9 \), we can find \( L \) and \( B \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Lily found \( 16 \) insects.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we first need to calculate the amount of yarn each of them used and then add those amounts together.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. 

First, let's convert these fractions to a common denominator to add them easily. The common denominator for 4 and 2 is 4. So, \( \frac{1}{2} \) can be written as \( \frac{2}{4} \).

Now, we add the fractions:
\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \]

This means they used \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein of yarn altogether.

Since there are 364 yards in a skein of yarn, we calculate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of 364 yards:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273 \]

So, they used 273 yards of yarn altogether."
"First, let's calculate the number of gifts for Cherrie's friends:

- 2 friends want 5 gifts each: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) gifts
- 3 friends want 2 gifts each: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) gifts

Adding these together, the total number of gifts for her friends is:
\[10 + 6 = 16\]

Cherrie also decides to buy 10 more random gifts. So, the total number of gifts Cherrie buys is:
\[16 + 10 = 26\]

Therefore, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is:
26"
"Given that the chair is 3 feet wide, we can start by determining the width of the rug. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so:

\[ \text{Width of the rug} = \text{Width of the chair} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. So, we calculate twice the width of the rug and then add 2 feet:

\[ \text{Length of the couch} = 2 \times \text{Width of the rug} + 2 = 2 \times 8 + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the length of the couch is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Let's define the variables for the problem:
- Let \( S \) be the cost of one pack of strawberry gum.
- Let \( G \) be the cost of one pack of grape gum.
- Let \( A \) be the cost of one pack of green apple gum.

From the problem, we know:
1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. She bought two packs of strawberry gum.
3. She bought one pack of grape gum.
4. She bought one small pack of green apple gum, which cost half as much as the grape gum.
5. The total cost of the gum is $7.

We can write the following equations based on the information provided:
1. \( 2S + G + \frac{1}{2}G = 7 \) (since the green apple gum costs half as much as the grape gum, we can write it as \( \frac{1}{2}G \))
2. \( G = 2 \) (since she paid $2 for a pack of grape gum)

Now substitute \( G = 2 \) into the first equation:
\[ 2S + 2 + \frac{1}{2}(2) = 7 \]
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]
\[ 2S = 4 \]
\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs \(\boxed{2}\) dollars."
"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to consider the cost and the number of sticks he can get from each type of wood. 

First, let's calculate the number of sticks per dollar for each type of wood:
- For a 2 x 4 piece of wood, he gets 200 sticks and it costs $4. So, the number of sticks per dollar is \( \frac{200}{4} = 50 \) sticks per dollar.
- For a 2 x 8 piece of wood, he gets 400 sticks and it costs $6. So, the number of sticks per dollar is \( \frac{400}{6} \approx 66.67 \) sticks per dollar.

Since the 2 x 8 piece of wood provides more sticks per dollar, Frederick should buy as many 2 x 8 pieces as possible with his $24.

Now, let's determine how many 2 x 8 pieces he can buy with $24:
\[ \frac{24}{6} = 4 \]
So, he can buy 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood, which will give him:
\[ 4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ sticks} \]

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make if he buys the cheapest lumber (which in this case is the 2 x 8 wood) is:
\[ \boxed{1600} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of legs Mario's sled dogs have. Since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, we calculate the total number of legs as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of snowshoes are required. Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:

\[ 24 \text{ legs} \div 2 \text{ legs per pair} = 12 \text{ pairs of snowshoes} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of pairs of snowshoes by the cost per pair:

\[ 12 \text{ pairs of snowshoes} \times \$12.00 \text{ per pair} = \$144.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:

\[ \$144.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of Janet's bus trips without the weekly bus pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day, and each trip costs $2.20. Therefore, the cost per day is:
\[ 2 \times 2.20 = 4.40 \]

Since she takes these trips five days a week, the weekly cost without the pass is:
\[ 4.40 \times 5 = 22.00 \]

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the weekly bus pass, which is $20. The savings from buying the weekly bus pass would be the difference between the weekly cost without the pass and the cost of the pass:
\[ 22.00 - 20.00 = 2.00 \]

So, Janet would save:
\[ \boxed{2.00} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.

From point 3, if the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has 30 cows, then the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.
From point 4, if the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, and the zoo has 20 sheep, then the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo:

- The farm has \(30\) cows + \(10\) sheep = \(40\) animals.
- The zoo has \(60\) cows + \(20\) sheep = \(80\) animals.

Therefore, the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo combined is \(40 + 80 = 120\).

"To determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start by analyzing the information given about Rose's purchases. Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, which is 4 times the amount Sophia bought.

First, we calculate the number of onions Sophia bought:
\[ \text{Number of onions Sophia bought} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the number of potatoes Sophia bought:
\[ \text{Number of potatoes Sophia bought} = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

Now, we add the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought to find the total:
\[ \text{Total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought} = 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 pounds. Since it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, for 30 pounds, the total calories needed to be burned are:

\[ 3500 \, \text{calories/pound} \times 30 \, \text{pounds} = 105,000 \, \text{calories} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of days Andy has to achieve this goal. The period from December 31st to July 19th is:

- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July (up to the 19th): 19 days

Adding these together:

\[ 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190 \, \text{days} \]

Now, we need to find out how many calories Andy needs to burn per day to meet his goal. This is calculated by dividing the total calories needed by the number of days:

\[ \frac{105,000 \, \text{calories}}{190 \, \text{days}} \approx 552.63 \, \text{calories/day} \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of:

\[ 553 \, \text{calories/day} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 553 \]"
"Gerald earns $30 every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate his total earnings for the week as follows:

\[ 30 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ dollars} \]

Gerald spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

\[ \text{Total water} = \text{Distance} \times \text{Water per km} = 2 \, \text{km} \times 60 \, \text{ml/km} = 120 \, \text{ml} \]

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water."
"First, let's calculate how much Julie spent on clothes. She spent 20% of $500 on clothes.

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 500 = 0.20 \times 500 = 100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on clothes. Now, let's find out how much money she has left after buying clothes.

\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on CDs. Now, let's find out how much money she has left after buying CDs.

\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

Therefore, Julie has $300 left."
"Let's define the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000.
2. The house costs three times as much as the lot.

We can express these as the following equations:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]
\[ H = 3L \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house using the second equation:
\[ H = 3L \]
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost is \(\boxed{90,000}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags that Tara bought.

Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, so the total number of bags is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ bags} \]

Each pack cost $4, so the total cost for 8 packs is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the bags. Tara sold each bag for $8, so the total revenue from selling 40 bags is:
\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 320 - 32 = 288 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the profit Tara earned on her bags is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially.

Ali has:
- Four $10 bills, which amount to \(4 \times 10 = 40\) dollars.
- Six $20 bills, which amount to \(6 \times 20 = 120\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money Ali has is:
\[40 + 120 = 160\] dollars.

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister. Therefore, the amount given to his sister is:
\[\frac{160}{2} = 80\] dollars.

The remaining amount of money Ali has after giving half to his sister is:
\[160 - 80 = 80\] dollars.

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:
\[\frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48\] dollars.

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:

"First, let's determine the rate at which each person can pick strawberries per hour.

1. **Tony's rate**: Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
2. **Bobby's rate**: Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby's rate is \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
3. **Kathy's rate**: Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy's rate is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) quarts per hour.
4. **Ricky's rate**: Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so Ricky's rate is \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Next, we add up the rates to find the total number of quarts picked per hour by all four individuals:
\[ 6 \text{ (Tony)} + 5 \text{ (Bobby)} + 10 \text{ (Kathy)} + 8 \text{ (Ricky)} = 29 \text{ quarts per hour} \]

"To determine how many rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we need to calculate the number of rows for the red tulips and the blue tulips separately, and then sum these values.

First, we calculate the number of rows for the red tulips:
- Jackson has 36 red tulips.
- He can fit 6 red tulips in each row.
- Therefore, the number of rows for the red tulips is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) rows.

Next, we calculate the number of rows for the blue tulips:
- Jackson has 24 blue tulips.
- He can fit 8 blue tulips in each row.
- Therefore, the number of rows for the blue tulips is \( \frac{24}{8} = 3 \) rows.

Adding the rows for the red and blue tulips together, we get:
- Total rows = rows of red tulips + rows of blue tulips = 6 + 3 = 9 rows.

Thus, Jackson will plant a total of 9 rows of flowers."

"First, let's calculate Ada's current weekly electric consumption and cost.

1. **Current Daily Consumption:**
   - Ada's current daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour.

2. **Current Weekly Consumption:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day, so her daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh) is:
     \[
     12 \text{ kWh/day}
     \]
   - There are 7 days in a week, so her weekly consumption is:
     \[
     12 \text{ kWh/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ kWh/week}
     \]

3. **Current Weekly Cost:**
   - The cost per kilowatt-hour is $1.50, so her weekly cost is:
     \[
     84 \text{ kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$126/\text{week}
     \]

Next, let's calculate Ada's new weekly electric consumption and cost after adding the new device.

1. **New Daily Consumption:**
   - The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour, so her new daily consumption is:
     \[

"First, let's determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house (since 5 days for half a house means 10 days for a whole house).

Now, if one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, then the number of person-days required to paint a whole house is 10 person-days.

If 5 people are working together, the number of person-days remains the same (10 person-days), but the time required to complete the work is reduced because more people are working.

To find out how many days it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we divide the total person-days by the number of people:

\[ \text{Days} = \frac{\text{Total person-days}}{\text{Number of people}} = \frac{10 \text{ person-days}}{5 \text{ people}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total number of hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house is:

\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( O_s \) be the number of sofas Ophelia has.
- Let \( O_c \) be the number of chairs Ophelia has.
- Let \( J_s \) be the number of sofas Jenna has.
- Let \( J_c \) be the number of chairs Jenna has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Ophelia has 20 sofas, so \( O_s = 20 \).
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( O_s = O_c - 2 \). Substituting \( O_s = 20 \), we get \( 20 = O_c - 2 \). Solving for \( O_c \), we get \( O_c = 22 \).
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so \( J_c = 3 \times O_c = 3 \times 22 = 66 \).
4. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( J_s = J_c - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64 \).

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:
- Total sofas = \( O_s + J_s = 20 + 64 = 84 \).
- Total chairs = \( O_c + J_c = 22 + 66 = 88 \).

Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs is \( 84 + 88 = 172 \).

Final numerical answer:
\[
\boxed{172}

"First, let's determine the cost of the headphone set. We know that Tom bought a CD for $4 and the total cost was $48. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of headphone set} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Cost of CD} = 48 - 4 = 44 \]

Next, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the $44 that he spent on the headphone set. Since each CD costs $4, the number of CDs he could have bought is:

\[ \text{Number of CDs} = \frac{\text{Cost of headphone set}}{\text{Cost of one CD}} = \frac{44}{4} = 11 \]

So, if Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have been able to buy 11 more CDs. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Josh worked out for 4 hours each week for 8 weeks, which amounts to \(4 \times 8 = 32\) hours. Additionally, he worked out for 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks, which adds up to \(5 \times 2 = 10\) hours. Lastly, he worked out for 6 hours in one week, adding another 6 hours.

To find the total number of hours he has spent working out across the 8 weeks, we sum these amounts:

\[32 + 10 + 6 = 48\]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is 48 hours."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of passengers**: 48

2. **First stop**:
   - **Passengers getting off**: 8
   - **Passengers getting on**: 5 times the number who got off, which is \(5 \times 8 = 40\)

   After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 + 40 = 80
   \]

3. **Second stop**:
   - **Passengers getting off**: 21
   - **Passengers getting on**: 3 times fewer than the number who got off, which is \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\)

   After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 + 7 = 66
   \]

So, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is **66**."
"First, let's determine Jame's current age. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, then his current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\).

Next, we need to find out how old Jame will be in 8 years. In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\) years old.

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, we calculate twice Jame's age in 8 years and then subtract 5:
\[2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55.\]
This means that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 55 years old.

To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55:
\[55 - 8 = 47.\]
So, Jame's cousin is currently 47 years old.

Now, we need to find the current age difference between Jame and his cousin:
\[47 - 22 = 25.\]

The number of years that separate the age of the two now is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Given that the computer cost $1,100 and Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can determine the cost of the printer as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of the printer} = \text{Cost of the computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We can set up the following equation to find the cost of one monitor:

\[ \text{Cost of the computer} + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} + \text{Cost of the printer} = 2400 \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 1100 + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} + 700 = 2400 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 1800 + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = 2400 \]

Subtract 1800 from both sides:

\[ 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = 600 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ \text{Cost of one monitor} = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300."

"To find Anne's age, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Alyana's age.
2. Use Alyana's age to find Anne's age.

First, we know Chenny is 10 years old. Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, so we subtract 4 from Chenny's age to find Alyana's age:
\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \]
So, Alyana is 6 years old.

Next, we know Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. Therefore, we add 2 to Alyana's age to find Anne's age:
\[ 6 + 2 = 8 \]
So, Anne is 8 years old.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm thick.

To find the total thickness of the four books, we add their individual thicknesses together:
\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188\]

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma should make to complete her monthly goal, we first need to calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

Adding these together:
18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs per month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:

72 - 54 = 18 vlogs

So, Emma should make 18 vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month."

"To solve this problem, we need to break down the month of April into two halves and determine the daily savings for each half.

1. **Determine the total number of days in April:**
   April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves:**
   - First half: 15 days
   - Second half: 15 days

3. **Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.**
   - Therefore, in the first half, he saves \( 15x \).

4. **Elvis saves twice as much each day in the second half:**
   - So, he saves \( 2x \) each day in the second half.
   - Therefore, in the second half, he saves \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

5. **Set up the equation for the total savings:**
   - Total savings = Savings in the first half + Savings in the second half
   - \( 15x + 30x = 1125 \)

6. **Combine like terms:**
   - \( 45x = 1125 \)

7. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{1125}{45} \)
   - \( x = 25 \)

8. **Determine the daily savings in the second half:**
   - Daily savings in the second half = \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \)

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 each day in the second half of the month."

"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."

"First, let's determine the ages of James's sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, so the other son is \(12 - 4 = 8\) years old.

Next, we need to find out how many candles James needs. Since he needs one candle for each year of age, he needs \(12 + 8 = 20\) candles.

Now, we need to figure out how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Each pack contains 5 candles, so we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: \(20 \div 5 = 4\) packs.

Each pack costs $3, so the total cost is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) dollars.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"First, let's calculate how many pages Judy read in the first week.

Judy read for 15 minutes each night. There are 7 nights in a week, so in the first week, she read for:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Given that Judy can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she reads per minute:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of pages she read in the first week:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages from the first week and the second week:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

Therefore, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ 240 \]"
"First, let's determine how many sandwiches Cody ate. Since Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

So, Cody ate 4 sandwiches.

Next, we calculate how many sandwiches Trevor ate. Since Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3
\]

So, Trevor ate 3 sandwiches.

Now, we add the number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor to find out how many sandwiches were eaten in total:

\[
4 + 3 = 7
\]

Finally, we subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the original number of sandwiches to find out how many are left:

\[
12 - 7 = 5
\]

Therefore, the number of sandwiches left is:

\[
5
\]"
"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

From the problem, we know:
- Shiloh's current age \( S = 44 \).
- In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \).
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, \( S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \).

Substituting \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

**Final Answer:**
10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Tooth**: The tooth fairy left $5.00.
2. **Next Three Teeth**: The tooth fairy gave $1.00 for each of the next three teeth.
   - For the second tooth: $1.00
   - For the third tooth: $1.00
   - For the fourth tooth: $1.00
   - Total for these three teeth: $1.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 = $3.00

3. **Last Two Teeth**: The tooth fairy gave half the amount of money per tooth as for the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth.
   - For the fifth tooth: $0.50
   - For the sixth tooth: $0.50
   - Total for these two teeth: $0.50 + $0.50 = $1.00

Now, let's add up all the amounts:
- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

Total amount of money left by the tooth fairy:
\[ 5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00 \]

So, the tooth fairy left Sharon a total of $9.00."
"Let's define the variables for the number of goals each teenager scored:
- Let \( R \) be the number of goals Richie scored.
- Let \( M \) be the number of goals Mark scored.
- Let \( A \) be the number of goals Anna scored.

From the problem, we know:
1. Richie scored 80 goals, so \( R = 80 \).
2. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, so \( R = M + 20 \).
3. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, so \( R = A + 45 \).

Using the value of \( R \):
- Since \( R = 80 \), we can substitute to find \( M \):
  \[
  80 = M + 20 \implies M = 80 - 20 = 60
  \]
- And for \( A \):
  \[
  80 = A + 45 \implies A = 80 - 45 = 35
  \]

Now, we need to find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:
\[
R + M + A = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175
\]

Therefore, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is \(\boxed{175}\)."
"First, we need to calculate how much money Mitchell made from selling lemonades. Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each. So, we multiply 21 by $4:

\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

This means Mitchell made $84.

Next, we know that Liam made $63. To find out how much more money Mitchell made compared to Liam, we subtract the amount Liam made from the amount Mitchell made:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam that weekend."
"First, let's determine how much Peter spends each day. Since he has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days), we divide $70 by 7:

\[ \frac{70}{7} = 10 \]

So, Peter spends $10 each day.

Next, we calculate how much he spends from Sunday through Wednesday. Since there are 4 days from Sunday to Wednesday, we multiply the daily spending by 4:

\[ 10 \times 4 = 40 \]

This means Peter spends $40 on wooden action figures from Sunday to Wednesday. Since each wooden action figure costs $5, we can find out how many wooden action figures he buys by dividing the total amount spent on wooden action figures by the cost of one wooden action figure:

\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, Peter buys 8 wooden action figures from Sunday to Wednesday.

Now, we need to find out how much money he has left after buying the wooden action figures. We subtract the amount spent on wooden action figures from his total money:

\[ 70 - 40 = 30 \]

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday), Peter will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. He has $30 left, so we can find out how many plastic action figures he can buy by dividing the remaining money by the cost of one plastic action figure:

\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

So, Peter buys 15 plastic action figures from Thursday to Saturday.

Finally, we add the number of wooden action figures and plastic action figures to find the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week:

\[ 8 + 15 = 23 \]

Therefore, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:

\[ \boxed{23} \]"
"To find out how much the kitten has cost Leah so far, we need to add up the costs of spaying the kitten, the vaccines, and the broken vases.

1. **Spaying cost**: $200
2. **Cost of 3 vaccines**: $20 each, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\)
3. **Cost of 4 broken vases**: $12 each, so \(4 \times 12 = 48\)

Now, we add these amounts together:

\[ 200 + 60 + 48 = 308 \]

So, the total cost so far is $308."
"First, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops each week:

- The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

Adding these together gives:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses per week} \]

Ford grows 40 roses every week. To find out how many roses he lacks each week, we subtract the number of roses he grows from the number of roses he needs to supply:
\[ 65 - 40 = 25 \text{ roses per week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly shortage by 4 to find the monthly shortage:
\[ 25 \times 4 = 100 \text{ roses per month} \]

Therefore, Ford lacks \(\boxed{100}\) roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To determine how much money Katina will have in her savings account after 2 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money removed from the account over 2 years.
2. Subtract this total from the initial amount in the account.

First, we calculate the total amount removed over 2 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, 2 years would be 24 months. Katina removes $100 each month, so over 24 months, she will remove:
\[ 100 \times 24 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account:
\[ 3000 - 2400 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money remaining in Katina's account after 2 years is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"To determine the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue, total cost, and then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.
   - Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Cost of bread: Each loaf of bread costs $3.00 and makes 10 sandwiches.
     - Cost of bread for 10 sandwiches = $3.00
   - Cost of cheeses and condiments: $30.00 for 10 sandwiches.
     - Cost of cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches = $30.00
   - Total cost for 10 sandwiches = Cost of bread + Cost of cheeses and condiments
     - Total cost for 10 sandwiches = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

3. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
     - Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

"First, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off. The difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature is \(468 - 450 = 18\). The percentage error is calculated as:

\[
\text{Percentage Error} = \left(\frac{18}{450}\right) \times 100 = 4\%
\]

This means Maggie's oven is 4% higher than the set temperature. To find the correct setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to find the temperature \(T\) such that \(T \times 1.04 = 520\). Solving for \(T\):

\[
T = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500
\]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees.

"First, we need to calculate the value of Juan's house. Since Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, we can find the value of Juan's house by calculating 30% of Herb's house price and subtracting it from the original price.

Herb's house price = $76,000

30% of $76,000 = 0.30 * $76,000 = $22,800

So, the value of Juan's house = $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now, we add the value of both houses to find the combined value:

Value of Juan's house + Value of Herb's house = $53,200 + $76,000 = $129,200

The value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Judy bought a dozen cups. A dozen is 12, so Judy brought 12 cups.
2. Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups. Since she bought 12 cups, she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.
3. Judy's friend brought 40 cups.
4. Judy's friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend:

- Total cups brought by Judy and her friend: \(12 + 40 = 52\)
- Total dishes brought by Judy and her friend: \(24 + 44 = 68\)

Adding the total cups and dishes together gives the total number of utensils:

"First, let's determine the cost of 2 boxes of contacts with the discount applied.

1. The original price of one box is $100.00.
2. The discount is 10%, so the discount amount per box is \(100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00\).
3. The price of one box after the discount is \(100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00\).
4. Therefore, the cost for 2 boxes is \(90.00 \times 2 = 180.00\).

Next, we need to find out how many single use contacts Pete gets from 2 boxes.

1. Each box contains 90 single use contacts.
2. Therefore, 2 boxes contain \(90 \times 2 = 180\) single use contacts.

Now, we calculate the cost per single use contact when buying 2 boxes.

1. The total cost for 2 boxes is $180.00.
2. The total number of single use contacts is 180.
3. The cost per single use contact is \(\frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00\).

Since the question asks for the cost per pair of contacts, and assuming a pair consists of 2 single use contacts:

1. The cost for 2 single use contacts is \(1.00 \times 2 = 2.00\).

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is $2.00."
"First, let's calculate the total hours worked by Jill and John.

Jill worked:
- 2 hours on Saturday

Total hours for Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

John worked:
- Twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday
- Three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday
Total hours for John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours

Next, we calculate the earnings for each person. Since they are paid $10 per hour:

Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30
John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:

Difference in earnings = John's earnings - Jill's earnings
Difference in earnings = $70 - $30 = $40

John earned $40 more than Jill."
"First, calculate the total calories burned from aerobics and running.

"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \), the number of red jelly beans as \( R \), and the number of green jelly beans as \( G \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \)
2. \( G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \)

The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500, so we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \) into the total equation, we get:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]
\[ 3B = 4500 \]
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find \( R \) and \( G \):
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."

Step 3: Weekly protein intake
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Weekly protein intake = \( 6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams/week} \).

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms."
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( x \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:
\[ x = 2(x - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
1. Distribute the 2 on the right side:
\[ x = 2x - 10 \]

2. Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides to isolate \( x \) on one side:
\[ x - 2x = -10 \]
\[ -x = -10 \]

3. Multiply both sides by -1 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

1. **Cost of 2 implants:**
   - Each implant costs $2000.
   - Total cost for 2 implants: \( 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of the porcelain crown:**
   - The porcelain crown for one implant costs an extra $500.
   - Total cost for the porcelain crown: \( 500 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost of dental work:**
   - Total cost for 2 implants + Cost of the porcelain crown: \( 4000 + 500 = 4500 \) dollars.

4. **Amount already paid as a deposit:**
   - Deposit: \( 600 \) dollars.

5. **Amount still needed:**
   - Total cost - Deposit: \( 4500 - 600 = 3900 \) dollars.

6. **Hourly wage and hours needed:**
   - George makes $15 per hour.
   - Hours needed to earn $3900: \( \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \) hours.

**Final Answer:**
George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \(x\). According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \(2x\), and another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \(3x\).

The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[x + 2x + 3x = 180\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[6x = 180\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 6:

\[x = 30\]

Now, we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \(2x = 2 \times 30 = 60\) degrees and \(3x = 3 \times 30 = 90\) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \(\boxed{90}\) degrees."
"First, let's convert all the coins Colby has into nickels, since each gumball costs a nickel.

- Colby has 8 quarters. Since 1 quarter is worth 25 cents, 8 quarters are worth \(8 \times 25 = 200\) cents.
- Colby has 6 dimes. Since 1 dime is worth 10 cents, 6 dimes are worth \(6 \times 10 = 60\) cents.
- Colby has 14 nickels. Since 1 nickel is worth 5 cents, 14 nickels are worth \(14 \times 5 = 70\) cents.
- Colby has 15 pennies. Since 1 penny is worth 1 cent, 15 pennies are worth \(15 \times 1 = 15\) cents.

Now, let's add up all the nickels (in cents) Colby has:
\[200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 \text{ cents}\]

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we divide the total amount of money Colby has by the cost of one gumball:
\[345 \div 5 = 69\]

So, Colby can buy \(\boxed{69}\) gumballs."
"To determine the total number of legs the pets in the store have, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

1. Dogs have 4 legs each.
2. Cats have 4 legs each.
3. Birds have 2 legs each.

Now, we calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

- Dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- Cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- Birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Next, we add the legs together to find the total number of legs:

\[20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}\]

Therefore, the total number of legs the pets in the store have is 48."
"First, we calculate the weight Jamaal uses after increasing the 8-pound weight by 50%.

\[ 8 \text{ pounds} \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, since the 12-pound weight is too heavy, he uses a weight that is 2 pounds lighter than 12 pounds.

\[ 12 \text{ pounds} - 2 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the weight that Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds."

"First, we need to determine the rate at which the plane is traveling. The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. The rate (speed) can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this rate. Using the formula for time, which is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Rate}} \]

we substitute the known values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate.

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolate Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ \text{Pounds of chocolate Ruiz makes in one hour} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds of chocolate Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds as Ruiz in one hour:

\[ \text{Pounds of chocolate Marissa makes in one hour} = 60 \times \frac{3}{4} = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we find out how many pounds of chocolate they can make together in one hour:

\[ \text{Total pounds of chocolate in one hour} = 60 + 45 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Since they worked for 12 hours in a day, we calculate the total amount of chocolate they made together in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Total pounds of chocolate in 12 hours} = 105 \times 12 = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total amount of chocolate they made together is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as on Tuesday, which is:
\[ 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up the total amount spent over the three days:
\[ 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \text{ dollars} \]

Howard originally had $100. After spending $88, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 100 - 88 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"First, let's calculate the earnings from the first four hours:

- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup.
- Earnings per hour = 15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour.
- Total earnings for 4 hours = $7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30.

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the next two hours:

- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
- Earnings per hour = 10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6.00/hour.
- Total earnings for 2 hours = $6.00/hour * 2 hours = $12.

Finally, let's add the earnings from both periods to find the total earnings:

- Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42.

Patrick earned a total of $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of rotations per tire per month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
   - For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
   - Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
     \[
     \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/rotation cycle}} \times 725 \text{ rotations} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of rotations per tire per year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of rotations per year is:
     \[
     145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}
     \]

3. **Determine how many years it takes for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations:**
   - The tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.

"First, we need to determine the total number of washings per pump. According to the directions, 2 pumps of shampoo give 120 washings. Therefore, 1 pump would give half of that:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump} \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per washing. The jumbo bottle costs $24.00 and provides 120 washings. So, the cost per washing is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \]

Since we need the cost per pump in cents, we convert the cost per washing to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents):

\[ 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \times 100 \text{ cents per dollar} = 20 \text{ cents per washing} \]

Now, since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost per pump is:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ cents per washing}}{60 \text{ washings per pump}} = \frac{20}{60} \text{ cents per pump} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ cents per pump} \approx 0.3333 \text{ cents per pump} \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the cost per pump is:

\[ \boxed{0.33} \]"
"First, let's calculate the discount on the shirt and the shorts.

The shirt originally costs $25 with a 30% discount:
\[ \text{Discount on shirt} = 25 \times \frac{30}{100} = 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]
\[ \text{Discounted price of shirt} = 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts originally cost $35 with a 30% discount:
\[ \text{Discount on shorts} = 35 \times \frac{30}{100} = 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]
\[ \text{Discounted price of shorts} = 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Now, let's add the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Joe has $50 initially. After the purchase, the amount of money he will have left is:

"To determine how much butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of butter needed for one dozen croissants.
2. Determine the total number of dozens Juan plans to make in a week.
3. Multiply the amount of butter needed for one dozen by the total number of dozens.

Step 1: Butter needed for one dozen croissants is \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound.

Step 2: Juan plans to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days. So, the total number of dozens is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total butter needed:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make the croissants for a week."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we need to calculate the cost of repaving each street and then find the difference.

First, calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:
\[ \text{Cost for Monica's street} = 150 \, \text{meters} \times 194 \, \text{\$/meter} \]
\[ \text{Cost for Monica's street} = 29100 \, \text{\$} \]

Next, calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:
\[ \text{Cost for Lewis' street} = 490 \, \text{meters} \times 194 \, \text{\$/meter} \]
\[ \text{Cost for Lewis' street} = 95060 \, \text{\$} \]

Now, find the difference in cost between Lewis' street and Monica's street:
\[ \text{Difference in cost} = 95060 \, \text{\$} - 29100 \, \text{\$} \]
\[ \text{Difference in cost} = 65960 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, it costs $65960 more to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street."
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the initial 5 months and the subsequent months.

1. **Initial 5 months:**
   - John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.
   - Total cost for the first 5 months: $100,000.

2. **Subsequent months:**
   - The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, which is 50 months in total.
   - Therefore, the research takes 50 - 5 = 45 months after the initial 5 months.
   - Each of these 45 months costs 50% more than the previous month.

Let's calculate the cost for each of these 45 months. The cost for the 6th month is:
\[ 100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000 \]

The cost for the 7th month is:
\[ 150,000 \times 1.5 = 225,000 \]

We can see that the cost forms a geometric series where the first term \(a = 150,000\) and the common ratio \(r = 1.5\). The sum of the first 45 terms of a geometric series is given by:
\[ S_n = a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1} \]
where \(n = 45\).

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ S_{45} = 150,000 \frac{1.5^{45} - 1}{1.5 - 1} = 150,000 \frac{1.5^{45} - 1}{0.5} = 300,000 (1.5^{45} - 1) \]

Now, we need to calculate \(1.5^{45}\):
\[ 1.5^{45} \approx 1,188,137.74 \]

So, the sum of the costs for the 6th to 50th months is:
\[ S_{45} = 300,000 (1,188,137.74 - 1) = 300,000 \times 1,188,136.74 = 356,440,022 \]

Adding the initial 5 months' cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 100,000 + 356,440,022 = 356,441,022 \]

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is:
\[ \boxed{356,441,022} \]"
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the basketball team, we need to add up the ounces of meat each player ate.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that's \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, we add up the ounces of meat:
\[ 6 \text{ ounces} + 8 \text{ ounces} + 16 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is:
\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \]"
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days in March.
2. Calculate the total number of posts per day for the entire group.
3. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in March.

March typically has 31 days.

Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day. With 1000 members, the total number of posts per day is:
\[ 1000 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ posts/member/day} = 3000 \text{ posts/day} \]

Now, to find the total number of posts in March:
\[ 3000 \text{ posts/day} \times 31 \text{ days} = 93000 \text{ posts} \]

Therefore, the total number of posts that the group will have in March is:
\[ 93000 \]"
"Gary does laundry twice a week, so in a year (52 weeks), he does laundry 52 * 2 = 104 times.

Each load uses 20 gallons of water, so for 104 loads, he uses 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons of water.

If a gallon of water costs $0.15, then for 2080 gallons, Gary spends 2080 * $0.15 = $312.

Therefore, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year."

Therefore, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks."
"First, we need to determine the total amount of meat Prince has to sell. Since Bill's bull weighs 750kg, Prince has 750kg of meat to sell.

Next, we need to calculate how much meat Prince sells in a day. He sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, so the amount of meat he sells in a day is:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take Prince to sell 750kg of meat. We do this by dividing the total amount of meat by the amount he sells per day:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

"First, let's calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium. Since there are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, the total number of seats is:
\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \]

Next, we determine how many seats were occupied by the administrators. Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \]

After the administrators have taken their seats, the number of remaining seats is:
\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \]

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. So, the number of seats occupied by the parents is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

The rest of the seats were occupied by the students. Therefore, the number of seats occupied by the students is:
\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \]

Thus, the number of students in the school auditorium is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, calculate the total number of street lights across all intersections:

"To find out how many total times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to calculate the remaining play times for each DVD and then sum them up.

1. The first DVD can be played 1000 times before it breaks and has already been played 356 times. So, the remaining play times for the first DVD are:
   \[
   1000 - 356 = 644 \text{ times}
   \]

2. The second DVD can be played 1000 times before it breaks and has already been played 135 times. So, the remaining play times for the second DVD are:

"To find the total cost of John's physical therapy, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours John spent in physical therapy.
2. Multiply the total number of hours by the cost per hour.

First, let's determine the total number of hours John spent in physical therapy. He went to therapy twice a week for 2 hours each session. Therefore, each week he spent:
\[ 2 \text{ sessions/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/session} = 4 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since he went to therapy for 6 weeks, the total number of hours is:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost. The cost per hour is $125, so the total cost is:
\[ 24 \text{ hours} \times 125 \text{ dollars/hour} = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of John's physical therapy is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Pack of Gum**: Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.

2. **Gum Chewed at School**: He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, after school, he has:
   \[
   20 - 4 = 16 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Gum Chewed on the Way Home and After Dinner**: He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so he chews:

"First, calculate the total number of flowers planted in Arianna's garden. Since there are 10 rows with 20 flowers in each row, the total number of flowers is:

\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \]

Next, determine how many of these flowers have bloomed. Since only \( \frac{4}{5} \) of the flowers have bloomed, we calculate:

\[ \frac{4}{5} \times 200 = \frac{4 \times 200}{5} = \frac{800}{5} = 160 \]

So, the number of flowers that have bloomed is:

\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in megabits per hour (Mb/h), we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kilobits per second (kb/s) to megabits per second (Mb/s).
2. Convert the speed from megabits per second to megabits per hour.

**Step 1: Convert kb/s to Mb/s**

Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can convert 20 kb/s to Mb/s by dividing by 1000:
\[ 20 \, \text{kb/s} = \frac{20}{1000} \, \text{Mb/s} = 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \]

**Step 2: Convert Mb/s to Mb/h**

There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply the speed in Mb/s by 3600 to get the speed in Mb/h:
\[ 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \times 3600 \, \text{s/h} = 72 \, \text{Mb/h} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed is 72 Mb/h."
"The tow truck pulled ten cars each day for the first three days. So, for the first three days, the total number of cars towed is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

On each of the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled four fewer cars than on the first three days. Therefore, it towed:
\[ 10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
for each of the remaining four days. So, for the remaining four days, the total number of cars towed is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Adding the number of cars towed over the entire week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

Therefore, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[ 54 \]"
"First, we need to convert Adam's current height from inches to feet to compare it with the height requirement for the roller coaster. Adam is currently 40 inches tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert his height as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The height requirement for the roller coaster is 4 feet. To find out how much more Adam needs to grow, we subtract his current height from the required height:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year. Converting this growth rate to feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches):

\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide the required growth by his annual growth rate:

\[ \frac{\frac{2}{3} \text{ feet}}{\frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year}} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, Adam will need to wait 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

4 years"
"First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the cars:
- James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
- Total revenue = 10 * $25,000 = $250,000.

Next, we need to determine the total cost to the company for acquiring these cars:
- The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
- Cost per car = 30% of $25,000 = 0.30 * $25,000 = $7,500.
- Total cost for 10 cars = 10 * $7,500 = $75,000.

Now, we calculate the total profit:
- Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

Finally, we calculate James's commission on the profits:
- James's commission rate is 10%.
- Commission = 10% of $175,000 = 0.10 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500."
"First, we need to determine how many riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. Given that 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate:

\[ 100 \text{ riders} \times 25\% = 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \text{ riders} \]

Next, we know that 60% of these riders who can stay upright are women. Therefore, the number of women who can stay upright is:

\[ 25 \text{ riders} \times 60\% = 25 \times 0.60 = 15 \text{ women} \]

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

\[ 25 \text{ riders} - 15 \text{ women} = 10 \text{ men} \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Given that the price of a diamond Jewell is $2000, we can find the price of a gold Jewell using the given ratio. The price of a gold Jewell is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond Jewell.

\[ \text{Price of gold Jewell} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600 \]

Next, we know that the cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of a gold Jewell.

\[ \text{Price of silver Jewell} = 1600 - 400 = 1200 \]

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver Jewells.

\[ \text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800 \]

Therefore, the total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and then sum them up.

1. **Snowflake Stamps**: Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. **Truck Stamps**: Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. So, the number of truck stamps is:
   \[
   16 + 3 = 19
   \]
3. **Rose Stamps**: Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. So, the number of rose stamps is:
   \[
   19 - 9 = 10
   \]

Now, we sum up all the stamps:
\[
16 \text{ (snowflake)} + 19 \text{ (truck)} + 10 \text{ (rose)} = 45
\]

Therefore, the total number of stamps Max bought is:
\[
\boxed{45}

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob. 

1. **Calculate the relative speed:**
   - Bob's speed: 55 miles per hour
   - Tom's speed: 70 miles per hour
   - Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed = 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

2. **Determine the time to close the gap:**
   - Initial distance between Tom and Bob: 75 miles
   - Time = Distance / Relative Speed = 75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"First, let's determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught as follows:

\[ \text{Fish caught by Darren} = 17 - 6 = 11 \]

Next, we need to find out how many fish Tommy caught. Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so we add 3 to the number of fish Darren caught:

\[ \text{Fish caught by Tommy} = 11 + 3 = 14 \]

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish."
"First, we need to determine the cost per class based on the total cost and the number of classes. The total cost for the classes is $60, and there are 10 classes in total. The cost per class is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Cost per class} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of classes}} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars per class}
\]

Next, we need to check if the cost per class exceeds $10. Since the cost per class is $6, which is less than $10, Manny's parents will still sign him up for the classes.

To find out how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we need to determine the maximum number of classes he can attend. Let's denote the number of classes Manny can attend as \( x \). The cost per class when he attends \( x \) classes is:

\[
\text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{x}
\]

We need this cost to be less than or equal to $10:

\[
\frac{60}{x} \leq 10
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
60 \leq 10x
\]

\[
x \geq 6
\]

This means Manny can attend at least 6 classes. Since there are 10 classes in total, the number of classes he can miss is:

\[
10 - 6 = 4
\]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10. 

\[
\boxed{4}

"First, let's determine the number of customers Julie processes daily. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, and Jewel processes 50 customers daily, Julie processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers daily.

Next, we calculate the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in one day. This is the sum of the customers processed by each: \(50 + 100 = 150\) customers per day.

Since they work all days of the week, we need to find out how many customers they process in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly production is \(150 \times 7 = 1050\) customers.

Final numerical answer:
\[

\[L + 3 = 20\]
\[L = 20 - 3\]
\[L = 17\]

Lynn ran 17 miles.

Lynn ran 17 miles."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

1. **Cost of one apple:**
   - Four apples cost $5.20.
   - Therefore, the cost of one apple is \(\frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30\) dollars.

2. **Cost of one orange:**
   - Three oranges cost $3.30.
   - Therefore, the cost of one orange is \(\frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

3. **Total cost for 5 apples:**
   - Since one apple costs $1.30, the cost for 5 apples is \(5 \times 1.30 = 6.50\) dollars.

4. **Total cost for 5 oranges:**
   - Since one orange costs $1.10, the cost for 5 oranges is \(5 \times 1.10 = 5.50\) dollars.

5. **Total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:**
   - Adding the costs together, we get \(6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00\) dollars.

"First, we need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) it will take him to dig the hole is:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

So, the time it will take Bob to dig the hole is:

\[ \boxed{216} \]"
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price of the truck to the costs of the additional features.

1. **Base Price of the Truck**: $30,000
2. **King Cab Upgrade**: $7,500
3. **Leather Seats**: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade
   \[
   \text{Cost of Leather Seats} = \frac{7500}{3} = 2500

"To find out how many miles Alisa and Stanley biked in total, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add those distances together.

First, let's calculate the distance Alisa biked:
- Alisa's speed: 12 miles per hour
- Alisa's time: 4.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Alisa biked = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Stanley biked:
- Stanley's speed: 10 miles per hour
- Stanley's time: 2.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Stanley biked = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances together to find the total distance biked by both:

"First, let's calculate the total cost Clara paid for her pomegranates on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the voucher was:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She received a $2 discount, so the final amount she paid was:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost Sheila paid for her pomegranates on Wednesday.

The price per pomegranate on Wednesday was $30, so the total cost before the discount for 20 pomegranates was:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

Sheila received a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount was:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final amount Sheila paid was:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
\[ \boxed{142} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount Ariadne earned from selling green hats in the first month. According to the problem, the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount earned from green hats. Therefore, the sales from green hats were:

\[ 400 \times 2 = 800 \]

So, the total sales for the first month were:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

In the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month. Therefore, the sales in the second month were:

\[ 1200 \times \frac{3}{4} = 900 \]

To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the sales from the first month and the second month:

\[ 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Therefore, the total amount she made in two months is:

\[ 2100 \]"
"James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he effectively pays for 3 hours.

The cost breakdown is as follows:
- The first hour costs $15.
- Each subsequent hour costs twice the first hour, so each additional hour costs $15 * 2 = $30.

Therefore, the total cost for 3 hours is:
- First hour: $15
- Second hour: $30
- Third hour: $30

Adding these together:
$15 + $30 + $30 = $75

James paid $75."
"Sally's bank account increased from $200 to $420 this week. The difference in her bank account balance is:

\[ 420 - 200 = 220 \]

This $220 represents the money she received this week, which includes her wage minus any amount that was withheld. Since her weekly wage should be $300, the amount withheld from her wage can be calculated by subtracting the $220 from her expected wage:

\[ 300 - 220 = 80 \]

Therefore, the amount withheld from Sally’s wage is $80."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:**
   - Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves.
   - Lori is inviting 16 guests.
   - Total deviled egg halves needed = \( 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ halves/guest} = 48 \text{ halves} \).

2. **Determine the number of whole eggs needed:**
   - 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves.
   - Total whole eggs needed = \( \frac{48 \text{ halves}}{2 \text{ halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ eggs} \).

3. **Convert the number of eggs to dozens:**
   - 1 dozen = 12 eggs.
   - Total dozens of eggs needed = \( \frac{24 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozens} \).

"Mike plans to read 10 pages a day. To find out how many days it will take him to read the entire 200-page book, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read each day.

\[ \text{Total days to finish reading} = \frac{200 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages/day}} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Since the assignment is due in 30 days, we can determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading by subtracting the number of days it takes him to read the book from the total number of days available.

\[ \text{Days before the deadline} = 30 \text{ days} - 20 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ days} \]

Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the plane. The plane cost $150,000.

Next, we calculate the monthly costs for the hanger and fuel. The cost to rent a hanger is $5000 per month. The cost for fuel is twice that amount, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month.

Now, we add the monthly costs for the hanger and fuel:
$5000 (hanger) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000 per month.

To find the total cost for the first year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (months in a year):
$15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the yearly maintenance cost:
$150,000 (plane) + $180,000 (yearly maintenance) = $330,000.

So, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $330,000."

1. Let \( R \) be the time it took to cook rice.
2. Let \( P \) be the time it took to cook pork.
3. Let \( B \) be the time it took to cook beans.

From the problem, we know:
- \( R = 30 \) minutes (time to cook rice).
- It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so \( P = R + 20 \).
- Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, so \( B = \frac{P + R}{2} \).

First, calculate the time to cook pork:
\[ P = R + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, calculate the time to cook beans:
\[ B = \frac{P + R}{2} = \frac{50 + 30}{2} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, add up the cooking times for all the food:
\[ R + P + B = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it took to cook all the food is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"

"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

We can write the following equations based on the total number of legs and heads:
1. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (total number of legs)
2. \( S + G = 20 \) (total number of heads)

We can simplify the first equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have the simplified system:
1. \( 2S + G = 35 \)
2. \( S + G = 20 \)

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the second equation from the first:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The original brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more.

To find 20% of $5:
\[ 20\% \times 5 = 0.20 \times 5 = 1 \]

So, the more expensive brand costs:
\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, which is 7 pounds:
\[ 7 \text{ pounds} \times 6 \text{ dollars per pound} = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

He also buys a donut for $2.

Adding the cost of the coffee and the donut:
\[ 42 + 2 = 44 \]

Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we first need to calculate the total amount Gus spent on the other items he bought.

1. **Cost of 2 bags of chips**: 
   - Each bag costs $2.00.
   - Total cost for 2 bags: \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of the bucket of fried chicken**: 
   - The bucket costs $8.00.

3. **Cost of the bottle of soda**: 
   - The bottle costs $1.00.

Next, we add up the costs of these items:
\[ 4 \text{ (chips)} + 8 \text{ (chicken)} + 1 \text{ (soda)} = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Gus spent a total of $20.00 at the grocery store. To find the cost of the apple pie, we subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount spent:
\[ 20 - 13 = 7 \]

Therefore, the cost of the apple pie is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

Total newspapers delivered in a day = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers - (Newspapers to District A + Newspapers to District C)

Let's calculate:

Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - (198 + 209)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 407
Newspapers delivered to District B = 193

James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John spends in the class.

- The class meets 4 times a week.
- Each session is 2 hours long.
- The class runs for 6 weeks.

So, the total number of hours spent in the class is:
\[ 4 \text{ sessions/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/session} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to determine how many recipes John learns. He learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. Therefore, we divide the total hours by 1.5 to find the number of recipes:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ hours}}{1.5 \text{ hours/recipe}} = 32 \text{ recipes} \]

So, John learns 32 recipes."
"First, we need to determine the number of history teachers on the basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \text{ history teachers} \]

Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \text{ math teachers} \]

Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ 60 \text{ math teachers} \times 6 \text{ hours/teacher} = 360 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours."
"First, let's determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[
\text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90
\]

Next, we find out how much money Rayna has. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so:

\[
\text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150
\]

Now, we add together the money that Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia have:

\[
\text{Total money} = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360
\]

To find out how much each person would have if they shared the total money equally, we divide the total by 3:

\[
\text{Money per person} = \frac{360}{3} = 120
\]

So, if they decided to add together their money and share equally, each would have \(\boxed{120}\) dollars."
"The game consists of 4 quarters, each 12 minutes long. So, the initial duration of the game is:

"To determine how many good days were left in the month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Good Days**: Christina had 12 good days in the first 30 days.
2. **First 8 Days**: The first 8 days were all good, so that's 8 good days.
3. **Second 8 Days**: The next 8 days were bad, so no good days here.
4. **Third 8 Days**: The following 8 days were neutral, so no good days here either.
5. **Next 3 Days**: The next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. This adds 2 more good days (since the first and third days were good).

Now, let's calculate the total number of good days:
- Initial good days: 12
- Good days in the first 8 days: 8
- Good days in the next 3 days: 2

Adding these together:
\[ 12 + 8 + 2 = 22 \]

So, the total number of good days in the month is 22. Since the question asks for the number of good days left in the month, and we have already accounted for all 30 days, the number of good days left is:

\[ \boxed{22} \]"
"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ 2S + 3 \]

We are also given that Janey has 21 books. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find the value of \( S \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 - 3 = 21 - 3 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]

Next, divide both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{2S}{2} = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

Sally has 9 books."
"First, let's convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the current height of 20 feet is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The target height is 600 inches. The difference in height that the bamboo needs to grow is:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches, we divide the total growth needed by the daily growth rate:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - James needs to buy 8 more toys to have enough for all 12 dogs.

2. **After Buying the Toys:**
   - James now has \(4 + 8 = 12\) toys for 12 dogs.
   - When he returns, there are twice as many dogs as before, so the number of dogs is \(12 \times 2 = 24\).
   - James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys to have enough for 24 dogs.

3. **After Buying More Toys:**
   - James now has \(12 + 12 = 24\) toys for 24 dogs.
   - When he returns again, 3 dogs are gone, so the number of dogs is \(24 - 3 = 21\).
   - James no longer needs toys for the 3 dogs that left, so he doesn't need to buy any more toys.

4. **Total Number of Toys Needed:**
   - Initially, he needed 8 toys.
   - Then, he needed 12 more toys.
   - No additional toys were needed after that.

So, the total number of toys James needs is \(8 + 12 = 20\).

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's determine how much Karen earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many hours Karen works in two days. If she works 3 hours per day, then in two days she works:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate Karen's earnings for these 6 hours. Since she earns $20 per hour, her total earnings for two days are:

\[ 20 \times 6 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Karen earns \(\boxed{120}\) dollars in two days."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion based on the given information.

Given:
- 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns.

We need to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes.

First, let's set up the proportion:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ potatoes}}{36 \text{ hash browns}} = \frac{96 \text{ potatoes}}{x \text{ hash browns}} \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ \frac{1 \text{ potato}}{6 \text{ hash browns}} = \frac{96 \text{ potatoes}}{x \text{ hash browns}} \]

Now, we can solve for \( x \) by cross-multiplying:
\[ 1 \cdot x = 6 \cdot 96 \]
\[ x = 576 \]

So, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes.

576"
"First, calculate the total weight of the 8 adults and Jack.

Each adult weighs 80 kg, so the total weight of 8 adults is:
\[ 8 \times 80 = 640 \text{ kg} \]

Adding Jack's weight (assuming Jack is also an adult):
\[ 640 + 80 = 720 \text{ kg} \]

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much the total weight exceeds the maximum load, subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 - 700 = 20 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, they will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by:
\[ 20 \text{ kg} \]"
"Let's define the number of cookies each person has using variables:
- Let \( K \) be the number of cookies Katarina has.
- Let \( M \) be the number of cookies Max has.
- Let \( C \) be the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of cookies Summer has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max: \( K = M - 5 \)
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster: \( M = C + 12 \)
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max: \( S = M + 23 \)
4. Katarina has 68 cookies: \( K = 68 \)

First, substitute \( K = 68 \) into the first equation to find \( M \):
\[ 68 = M - 5 \]
\[ M = 68 + 5 \]
\[ M = 73 \]

Next, substitute \( M = 73 \) into the second equation to find \( C \):
\[ 73 = C + 12 \]
\[ C = 73 - 12 \]
\[ C = 61 \]

Then, substitute \( M = 73 \) into the third equation to find \( S \):
\[ S = 73 + 23 \]
\[ S = 96 \]

Now, we know:
- Katarina has 68 cookies.
- Max has 73 cookies.
- The Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.
- Summer has 96 cookies.

To find the total number of cookies, sum these values:
\[ 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 \]

Therefore, the total number of cookies they have is:
\[ \boxed{298} \]"
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the length after the extension is \( x + 0.5x = 1.5x \).

Then, she adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom, making the final length \( 1.5x + 20 \) cm.

We know that the final length of the dress is 140 cm. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time Chris spent mowing the lawn in each mode and then sum these times.

1. **Determine the mowing rates in each mode:**
   - In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes). Therefore, his mowing rate in ""turtle"" mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} \).
   - In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""rabbit"" mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} \).

2. **Calculate the time spent mowing in each mode:**
   - Since Chris mowed half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode, the time spent in ""turtle"" mode is \( \frac{1}{2} \) of 60 minutes, which is 30 minutes.
   - Similarly, since Chris mowed the other half in ""rabbit"" mode, the time spent in ""rabbit"" mode is \( \frac{1}{2} \) of 40 minutes, which is 20 minutes.

3. **Sum the times:**
   - Total time spent mowing the lawn = time in ""turtle"" mode + time in ""rabbit"" mode = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn."

"First, let's determine how many cookies Celinda baked. Since Celinda baked twice as many cookies as Greta, and Greta baked 30 cookies, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cookies baked by Celinda} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we find the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda:

\[ \text{Total cookies} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]

After baking, the pair ate 10 cookies. So, we subtract the 10 cookies they ate from the total number of cookies:

\[ \text{Cookies left} = 90 - 10 = 80 \]

Therefore, the number of cookies in the box is:

\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"Let's define the variables for the ages of the individuals:
- Let \( T \) be the age of one of the triplets.
- Let \( W \) be the age of one of the twins.

From the problem, we know two key pieces of information:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
2. The combined ages of the twin and the triplet are 44.

We can express these pieces of information as equations:
1. \( W = T + 7 \)
2. \( W + T = 44 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( T \):
\[ (T + 7) + T = 44 \]
\[ 2T + 7 = 44 \]
\[ 2T = 37 \]
\[ T = 18.5 \]

Now that we have the age of the triplet, we can find the age of the twin using the first equation:
\[ W = T + 7 \]
\[ W = 18.5 + 7 \]
\[ W = 25.5 \]

So, the age of one of the twins is \( 25.5 \) years.

"First, let's determine the cost of the candies. We know that five lollipops and four candies cost $3.20 in total, and each lollipop costs $0.40.

The cost of five lollipops is:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

So, the cost of the four candies is:
\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

Therefore, the cost of one candy is:
\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Adding these together, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many coins Neil saves each month. Since Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong, we calculate Neil's monthly savings as follows:

\[ \text{Neil's monthly savings} = 20 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \right) \]
\[ \text{Neil's monthly savings} = 20 + 8 = 28 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each has saved over ten years. Since there are 12 months in a year, over ten years, there are:

\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Now, we calculate the total savings for Rong and Neil over these 120 months.

For Rong:
\[ \text{Total savings for Rong} = 20 \times 120 = 2400 \]

For Neil:
\[ \text{Total savings for Neil} = 28 \times 120 = 3360 \]

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Each vaccine costs $20 and there are 2 vaccines, so the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Let the total bill be \( x \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:
\[ 0.60x \]

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ x = 40 + 0.60x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation:
\[ x - 0.60x = 40 \]
\[ 0.40x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. Therefore, the amount he leaves with is:

- The cost of one apple is $0.5.
- The cost of one banana is twice that of an apple, so it is \(2 \times 0.5 = \$1.0\).
- The cost of one orange is three times that of a banana, so it is \(3 \times 1.0 = \$3.0\).

Next, we calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:
- For bananas: \(5 \text{ bananas} \times \$1.0 \text{ per banana} = \$5.0\).
- For apples: \(12 \text{ apples} \times \$0.5 \text{ per apple} = \$6.0\).
- For oranges: \(7 \text{ oranges} \times \$3.0 \text{ per orange} = \$21.0\).

Finally, we sum these amounts to find the total price for the crate:
\[
\$5.0 + \$6.0 + \$21.0 = \$32.0
\]

Therefore, the price for such a crate of fruit is \(\$32.0\)."
"To determine the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter, we need to calculate the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - Given: 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - There are 4 more blue squares than red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 (red squares) + 4 = 18 blue squares.

3. **Green Squares:**
   - There are 6 more green squares than blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 (blue squares) + 6 = 24 green squares.

4. **White Squares:**
   - There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 (green squares) - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares in the comforter:
\[ 14 \text{ (red)} + 18 \text{ (blue)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 12 \text{ (white)} = 68 \text{ squares} \]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is:

"First, let's determine the number of regular chairs Mia's restaurant currently has. Given that the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

\[ \text{Number of regular chairs} = 5 \times \text{Number of high chairs} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of chairs currently available:

\[ \text{Total current chairs} = \text{Number of regular chairs} + \text{Number of high chairs} = 40 + 8 = 48 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs needed for the function. There will be 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of chairs required is:

\[ \text{Total chairs needed} = 42 + 15 = 57 \]

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the number of chairs currently available from the total number of chairs needed:

\[ \text{Additional chairs needed} = \text{Total chairs needed} - \text{Total current chairs} = 57 - 48 = 9 \]

Therefore, Mia has to get \(\boxed{9}\) more chairs."

"First, let's calculate the points collected by each student:

1. **Adam's Points**: Adam has 50 points.
2. **Betty's Points**: Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. So, we calculate 30% of Adam's points and add it to Adam's points.
   \[
   \text{Betty's points} = 50 + (0.30 \times 50) = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]
3. **Tom's Points**: Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
   \[
   \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35
   \]
4. **Betty's Points (Recheck)**: We already calculated Betty's points as 65.
5. **Marta's Points**: Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom.
   \[
   \text{Marta's points} = 3 \times 35 = 105
   \]

Now, let's sum up the points collected by all students:
\[
\text{Total points} = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255
\]

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. Therefore, the class is missing:
\[
400 - 255 = 145 \text{ points}
\]

**Final Answer**: The class is missing 145 points to go on the trip."

"First, let's calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400 paycheck into her retirement account.

\[ \text{Retirement contribution} = 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

Next, we calculate how much she uses for her monthly car payment. She uses 20% of her paycheck for this.

\[ \text{Car payment} = 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

Now, we subtract the amounts for retirement and the car payment from her total paycheck to find out how much she has left to spend.

\[ \text{Money left to spend} = 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

So, the final amount of money Greta has left to spend is $720."

- Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks.
- Fireworks Hannah will see from the city = \(300 \times 0.40 = 120\) fireworks.

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard:

- Hannah is setting off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each.
- Total fireworks from Hannah's backyard = \(3 \times 5 = 15\) fireworks.

Finally, let's add the fireworks Hannah will see from the city and the fireworks she will set off in her backyard to get the total number of fireworks Hannah will see:

- Total fireworks Hannah will see = \(120 + 15 = 135\) fireworks.

**Total fireworks Hannah will see: 135**"
"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person will take one seat, two drinks, and three snacks. Since there are 20 people, the total number of drinks needed is:

\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

And the total number of snacks needed is:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Each drink and each snack costs $2, so the total cost for the drinks is:

\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \]

And the total cost for the snacks is:

\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \]

Adding the cost of the drinks and the snacks together gives the total amount spent:

"To determine how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

1. Let \( G \) represent the amount of gravel Gissela's truck can carry. According to the problem, \( G = 4000 \) pounds.
2. Let \( Go \) represent the amount of gravel Gordy's truck can carry. The problem states that Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so \( Go = G + 800 \).
3. Let \( Ga \) represent the amount of gravel Gary's truck can carry. The total amount of gravel that all three trucks can carry together is 11,600 pounds, so \( G + Go + Ga = 11600 \).

First, substitute the value of \( G \) into the equation for \( Go \):
\[ Go = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \]

Next, substitute the values of \( G \) and \( Go \) into the total capacity equation:
\[ 4000 + 4800 + Ga = 11600 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ 8800 + Ga = 11600 \]

To find \( Ga \), subtract 8800 from both sides of the equation:
\[ Ga = 11600 - 8800 = 2800 \]

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry \(\boxed{2800}\) pounds of gravel."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of dumplings each group ate:**

"First, we need to determine the speed of Martha's turtle. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and the cat can run at 15 feet/second, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we need to calculate how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We do this by multiplying the turtle's speed by the time.

\[ \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find out how many more hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first need to determine how much more money they need to raise. The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount to be raised is:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money they raise per hour. From the first 3 hours, they raised $2100. Therefore, the amount raised per hour is:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Now, to find out how many more hours they need to raise the remaining $4200, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

So, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal is:

\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]

"First, let's determine the percentage of the river's water that is used for non-industrial purposes by the city.

1. The city uses 40% of the river's water.
2. 80% of that 40% is used for industrial purposes. So, the percentage of the river's water used for industrial purposes is:
   \[
   40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 = 32\%
   \]
3. Therefore, the percentage of the river's water used for non-industrial purposes is:
   \[
   40\% - 32\% = 8\%
   \]

The city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes."
"To find out how much Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days in 2 weeks.
2. Multiply the number of days by the daily rate.

Step 1: There are 7 days in a week, so in 2 weeks, there are \(7 \times 2 = 14\) days.

Step 2: Alex charges $12 per day, so for 14 days, the total charge is \(12 \times 14\).

Now, let's calculate \(12 \times 14\):

\[12 \times 14 = 12 \times (10 + 4) = (12 \times 10) + (12 \times 4) = 120 + 48 = 168\]

Therefore, Alex charges $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream and then calculate the total production over 48 hours.

1. **Chocolate Ice Cream Production Rate:**
   - The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
   - Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

2. **Vanilla Ice Cream Production Rate:**
   - The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
   - Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

3. **Total Production in 48 Hours:**
   - For chocolate ice cream in 48 hours: \( 50 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).
   - For vanilla ice cream in 48 hours: \( 12.5 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

4. **Total Quarts Produced:**
   - Adding the production of both types of ice cream: \( 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \).

"Erin has $6.00 and each scoop costs $1.50. With the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. 

First, let's calculate how many scoops she can buy with her $6.00:
\[ \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

Since she buys 2 scoops and gets 1 free for each set of 2 scoops, buying 4 scoops means she gets 2 free scoops (because 4 scoops / 2 = 2 free scoops).

So, the total number of scoops she gets is:
\[ 4 \text{ (bought)} + 2 \text{ (free)} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 6 \text{ scoops} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much candy Ginger and Amy each eat in two weeks.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day. There are 14 days in two weeks, so Ginger eats:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy eats 3 pieces a day. So, in two weeks, Amy eats:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, let's determine how much candy each has left after two weeks. Both started with 100 pieces.

Ginger's remaining candy:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy's remaining candy:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

To find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

So, after two weeks, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger."
"First, we need to determine the area that Mr. Boarden wants to cover, which is two thirds of his 36 square feet bathroom.

\[
\text{Area to cover} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \text{ sq ft} = 24 \text{ sq ft}
\]

Next, we know that for every square foot, Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles. Therefore, for 24 square feet, the number of tiles required is:

\[
\text{Number of tiles} = 24 \text{ sq ft} \times 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft} = 576 \text{ tiles}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries. The initial cost to go picking is $20, and then there's an additional cost of $1.5 per pound for the 30 pounds James picked.

The cost for the blueberries themselves is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5/\text{pound} = \$45 \]

Adding the initial cost to go picking:
\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost if James had bought the same amount of blueberries at the store. The store price is $2.5 per pound, so for 30 pounds, the cost would be:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5/\text{pound} = \$75 \]

Now, to find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying at the store:
\[ \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \]

So, James saved:

"First, calculate the total cost of the pencils:
- Cost of one pencil = $0.50
- Number of pencils = 6
- Total cost of pencils = $0.50 * 6 = $3.00

Next, calculate the total cost of the erasers:
- Cost of one eraser = $0.25
- Number of erasers = 8
- Total cost of erasers = $0.25 * 8 = $2.00

Now, add the total cost of pencils and erasers to find the overall cost:
- Total cost = Cost of pencils + Cost of erasers
- Total cost = $3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00

Finally, subtract the total cost from the amount paid to find the change:
- Amount paid = $10.00
- Change = Amount paid - Total cost
- Change = $10.00 - $5.00 = $5.00

**Change: $5.00**"

"To determine the total number of taps Helga makes, we need to calculate the taps for each foot separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the taps per minute for each foot:
- When her arms are down, she taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute.
- When her arms are raised, she taps each foot at 200 taps per minute.

Next, we need to determine the time spent in each state:
- Total dancing time: 5 minutes
- Time with arms raised: 2 minutes
- Time with arms down: \(5 - 2 = 3\) minutes

Now, we calculate the taps for each foot during the respective times:
1. **Right foot:**
   - With arms down: \(300 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 900 \text{ taps}\)
   - With arms raised: \(200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}\)
   - Total for right foot: \(900 + 400 = 1300 \text{ taps}\)

2. **Left foot:**
   - With arms down: \(250 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ taps}\)
   - With arms raised: \(200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}\)
   - Total for left foot: \(750 + 400 = 1150 \text{ taps}\)

Finally, we sum the taps for both feet:
\[1300 \text{ (right foot)} + 1150 \text{ (left foot)} = 2450 \text{ taps}\]

Thus, the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet is:

"To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of having the city fix it and the total cost of Ron fixing it himself, then find the difference between these two amounts.

1. **Cost if the city fixes the pothole:**
   - The pothole will do $450 worth of damage to Ron's car if it is not fixed.
   - Therefore, the cost if the city fixes it is $450.

2. **Cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself:**
   - Ron will be fined $120 for unauthorized road maintenance.
   - Ron will also need to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, each costing $25.
   - The total cost for the asphalt is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost for Ron to fix the pothole himself is \(120 + 75 = 195\) dollars.

3. **Savings by fixing the pothole:**
   - The savings is the difference between the cost if the city fixes it and the cost if Ron fixes it himself.
   - This is \(450 - 195 = 255\) dollars.

So, Ron saves \(\boxed{255}\) dollars by fixing the pothole himself."
"The restaurant originally has 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs, totaling:

\[ 170 + 23 = 193 \]

After sending 20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs for repair, the number of chairs left is:

\[ (170 - 20) + (23 - 13) = 150 + 10 = 160 \]

So, the restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pizza slices. Since each of the 5 friends ordered one pizza and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we need to determine how many slices each group of friends ate.

Bryce and his two friends ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas. Since each of these three friends ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of a 12-slice pizza, the number of slices each of them ate is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \]

Since there are three friends in this group, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

The two remaining friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas. Since each of these two friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a 12-slice pizza, the number of slices each of them ate is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \]

Since there are two friends in this group, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Now, we add the slices eaten by both groups to find the total number of slices eaten:

\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices to find the number of slices left:

\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \]

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. The dog can eat the sausages in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes. Since the cat takes 30 minutes, the time for the dog is:

"First, we need to convert the length of one of Topher's shoes into inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 8 feet and 4 inches is equivalent to:

\[ 8 \times 12 + 4 = 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

Let the length of one of Bobby's shoes be \( x \) inches. According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. This can be expressed as:

\[ 9x + 10 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 9x = 90 \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars. There are 64 students' cars, each with 4 windows. Since Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of students' cars smashed} = \frac{1}{4} \times 64 = 16
\]

Each of these 16 cars has 4 windows, so the total number of windows smashed for the students' cars is:

\[
16 \times 4 = 64
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars, each with 2 windows. Since Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of teachers' cars smashed} = \frac{3}{4} \times 32 = 24
\]

Each of these 24 cars has 2 windows, so the total number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars is:

\[
24 \times 2 = 48
\]

Adding the windows smashed for both the students' and teachers' cars gives us the total number of windows smashed:

\[
64 + 48 = 112
\]

Therefore, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:

\[
\boxed{112}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of spools Candy has:

- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45
- Light green spools: 40
- Dark green spools: 50

Total spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

Next, we calculate the number of blue spools:

- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45

Total blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\% \]

Therefore, 40% of Candy's spools are blue."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of people**: 5000

2. **People who voted by midday (12:00)**:
   - By midday, \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the people had voted.
   - Number of people who voted by midday = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \).

3. **Remaining people after midday**:
   - Remaining people = Initial number - Number of people who voted by midday
   - Remaining people = 5000 - 2000 = 3000.

4. **People who voted by 16:00**:
   - By 16:00, \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining people had voted.
   - Number of people who voted by 16:00 = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \).

5. **Remaining people who had not voted by 16:00**:
   - Remaining people = Remaining people after midday - Number of people who voted by 16:00
   - Remaining people = 3000 - 2000 = 1000.

**Final answer**: 1000 people had not voted by 16:00."
"To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need for 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will need for 30 days.
2. Determine how many packs of gum are required based on the number of pieces per pack.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will need for 30 days:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of gum are required. Since each pack contains 15 pieces of gum, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Parker will need \(\boxed{8}\) packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total number of smores needed.

- Each of the 9 kids wants 2 smores, so the kids will need \(9 \times 2 = 18\) smores.
- Each of the 6 adults will eat 1 smore, so the adults will need \(6 \times 1 = 6\) smores.
- Therefore, the total number of smores needed is \(18 + 6 = 24\).

Next, we need to determine how many graham cracker sleeves are required to make 24 smores. Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, we divide the total number of smores by the number of smores per sleeve:

\[ \frac{24}{8} = 3 \]

Since 3 sleeves are needed and there are 3 sleeves in a box, they will need 1 box of graham crackers.

"First, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( D \) represent Dora's age.
2. Let \( F \) represent Dora's father's age.
3. Let \( M \) represent Dora's mother's age.

From the problem, we know:
- Dora is 15 years old, so \( D = 15 \).
- Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age, so \( F = 2D + 8 \).
- Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, so \( M = F - 4 \).

Now, substitute \( D = 15 \) into the equation for \( F \):
\[ F = 2(15) + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Next, substitute \( F = 38 \) into the equation for \( M \):
\[ M = 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Now, we need to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:
\[ D + F + M = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

Therefore, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:
\[ 87 \]"
"To find out how much money each person gets, we need to divide the total amount of money by the number of people sharing it. Greg and his 3 siblings make a total of 4 people.

Each of them got $5."
"First, let's break down the weights of each book:

- Math and science books: 2 pounds each. Since there are two such books, the total weight for these is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds.
- French book: 4 pounds.
- English book: 3 pounds.
- History book: Twice the weight of the English book, so \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds.

Now, we add up the weights of all the books:

\[4 \text{ (math and science)} + 4 \text{ (French)} + 3 \text{ (English)} + 6 \text{ (history)} = 17 \text{ pounds}\]

So, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds."
"First, let's calculate the number of votes candidate A received. Since candidate A got 20% of the votes and there were 100 voters:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate A} = 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

Next, we need to find out how many votes candidate B received. Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes. So, we calculate 50% of candidate A's votes and add it to candidate A's votes:

\[ \text{50% of candidate A's votes} = 50\% \times 20 = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \]

\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Now, we can find out how many votes candidate C received by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (\text{Votes for candidate A} + \text{Votes for candidate B}) \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

So, candidate C received 50 votes."
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck initially has. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we can calculate Beck's initial number of apples as follows:

\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \]

So, Beck initially has 77 apples.

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. After this transaction, Boris will have:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]

And Beck will have:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this exchange. We do this by subtracting the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris.

Final answer:

"First, let's calculate the amount of water used for each type of cube:

1. **Giant cubes**: Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water. Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   \[
   3 \text{ giant cubes} \times 4 \text{ ounces per cube} = 12 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Medium cubes**: Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water. Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   \[
   7 \text{ medium cubes} \times 2 \text{ ounces per cube} = 14 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Small cubes**: Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water. Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   \[
   8 \text{ small cubes} \times 0.5 \text{ ounces per cube} = 4 \text{ ounces}
   \]

Next, we add up the total amount of water used:
\[
12 \text{ ounces} + 14 \text{ ounces} + 4 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}
\]

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how much water he has left, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount:

"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. According to the problem, a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5, we can set up the following equation to find the cost of a half-gallon jar:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 5 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars. Since each gallon jar costs $5, the total cost for 10 gallon jars is:

\[ \text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars. Since each half-gallon jar costs $3, the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:

\[ \text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Finally, we add the two amounts together to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 50 + 48 = 98 \]

So, the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of students**: 50
2. **Students who like to bake**: 10
3. **Students who like to play basketball**: 5
4. **Students who like to play music**: Let's denote this as \( M \).
5. **Students who like to play video games**: Let's denote this as \( V \).

From the problem, we know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that like to play basketball. Therefore, we can write:
\[ M = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

The total number of students is the sum of those who like to bake, play basketball, play video games, and play music. So, we can write the equation:
\[ 10 + 5 + V + M = 50 \]

Substituting the value of \( M \) into the equation:
\[ 10 + 5 + V + 10 = 50 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 25 + V = 50 \]

Solving for \( V \):
\[ V = 50 - 25 \]
\[ V = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is 25."

"Since the total number of students in the two classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, we can determine the number of students in each class by dividing 80 by 2:

\[ \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \]

In each class, 40% of the students are girls. Therefore, the number of girls in each class is:

\[ \text{Number of girls in each class} = 40 \times 0.40 = 16 \]

To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

\[ \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24 \]

Therefore, the number of boys in each class is 24."

"To determine how much money the tomato vendor saves in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily savings.
2. Multiply the daily savings by the number of days in a week.

**Step 1: Calculate the daily savings.**

- The vendor used to buy tomatoes for $0.50 each.
- The new vendor sells tomatoes for $0.40 each.
- The difference in price per tomato is $0.50 - $0.40 = $0.10.
- The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.
- Therefore, the daily savings are $0.10 * 500 = $50.

**Step 2: Calculate the weekly savings.**

- There are 7 days in a week.
- The weekly savings are $50 * 7 = $350.

"First, let's determine how many marbles Cal has. Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, and Sean has 56 marbles, we can set up the following relationship:

\[ \text{Sean's marbles} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]

Given Sean has 56 marbles:

\[ 56 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]

To find Cal's marbles, we multiply both sides by 2:

\[ \text{Cal's marbles} = 56 \times 2 = 112 \]

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Carl has. Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean:

\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times \text{Sean's marbles} \]

Given Sean has 56 marbles:

\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which means the sum of the votes in favor and against the regulation is 33. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into this expression:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."

"First, calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win the race. This is 20% of 50 people:

\[ 20\% \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Next, find out how many people are left after accounting for those who think horse #2 will win:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, calculate how many of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. This is 60% of the remaining 40 people:

\[ 60\% \times 40 = 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

Finally, to find out how many people think horse #12 will win, subtract the number of people who think horse #2 or horse #7 will win from the total number of people:

\[ 50 - 10 - 24 = 16 \]

Therefore, 16 people think that horse #12 will win the big race."
"To find out how many puppies Jana has, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Pomeranians.
2. Use the total number of Pomeranians to find the total number of puppies.

First, we know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. So, if we let \( P \) be the total number of Pomeranians, we can write the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{3}P = 6
\]
To find \( P \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 3:
\[
P = 6 \times 3 = 18
\]
So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians.

Next, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let \( T \) be the total number of puppies. Then, we can write:
\[
\frac{2}{3}T = 18
\]
To find \( T \), we multiply both sides of the equation by \(\frac{3}{2}\):
\[
T = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27
\]

Therefore, Jana has \(\boxed{27}\) puppies."
"First, let's determine how much money Ava gave to Jayden. Ava has $90 and she gave Jayden half of it. So, we calculate half of $90:

\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Next, we add the $45 that Ava gave to Jayden to the $70 Jayden already had:

\[ 70 + 45 = 115 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera, which costs $200. We subtract the amount of money Jayden has from the cost of the camera:

\[ 200 - 115 = 85 \]

So, Jayden needs \(\boxed{85}\) more dollars to buy the camera."
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = \frac{7}{2}x \]

So, the equation becomes:

\[ \frac{7}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{7} \):

\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{7} = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases of shingles. Substituting \( x \):

\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Therefore, the third house will need approximately 142.86 cases of shingles. Since we are asked for the final numerical answer:

\[ \boxed{143} \]"

"First, let's calculate Tanya's earnings for Monday:

- She teaches for 5 hours at $15 per hour, so her base earnings are \(5 \times 15 = 75\) dollars.
- Since she taught more than 3 classes, she gets an additional $5, making her total for Monday \(75 + 5 = 80\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate her earnings for Wednesday:

- She teaches for 2 hours at $15 per hour, so her base earnings are \(2 \times 15 = 30\) dollars.
- Since she taught 2 classes, which is not more than 3, she does not get the additional $5 bonus.
- Therefore, her total for Wednesday is \(30\) dollars.

Adding the earnings from both days, Tanya's total earnings are \(80 + 30 = 110\) dollars.

**Final Answer: 110**"

"Let's define the variables for the quantities involved:
- Let \( E_e \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( A_e \) be the number of enemies Ava jumps on.
- Let \( E_b \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( A_b \) be the number of berries Ava collects.
- Let \( E_t \) be the time left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.
- Let \( A_t \) be the time left on the timer when Ava finishes the level.

From the problem, we know:
- \( A_e = E_e + 8 \)
- \( A_b = E_b + 3 \)
- \( A_t = E_t + 4 \)

The points for each player are calculated as follows:
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times \text{number of enemies} \)
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times \text{number of berries} \)
- Points from time: \( 30 \times \text{time left on the timer} \)

So, the total score for Emma is:
\[ \text{Score}_E = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \]

And the total score for Ava is:
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10A_e + 5A_b + 30A_t \]

Substituting the relationships we have:
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(E_b + 3) + 30(E_t + 4) \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120 \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215 \]

"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( O \) be the number of orange fish Bob bought.
- Let \( W \) be the number of white fish Bob bought.

Initially, Bob had:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

After buying more fish, the total number of fish in the pond is:
- \( 3 + O \) orange fish
- \( 4 + W \) white fish

According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]
\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

Additionally, the total number of fish Bob bought is 17:
\[ O + W = 17 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( O - 2W = 5 \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

We can solve this system by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. From the second equation, we can express \( O \) in terms of \( W \):
\[ O = 17 - W \]

Substitute \( O \) in the first equation:
\[ 17 - W - 2W = 5 \]
\[ 17 - 3W = 5 \]
\[ -3W = 5 - 17 \]
\[ -3W = -12 \]
\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

"First, we need to determine how many 9-person groups can be formed from 90 people. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of people by the group size:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{90}{9} = 10 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups each brought back 2 seashells. According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the groups brought back seashells. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of groups that brought back seashells} = \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]

Each of these 6 groups brought back 2 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is:

\[ \text{Total seashells} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"

"To determine how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily earnings from bottle caps.
2. Multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in the month.

First, we know that Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day and each bottle cap is worth $0.25. Therefore, his daily earnings are:
\[ 10 \text{ bottle caps/day} \times \$0.25/\text{bottle cap} = \$2.50/\text{day} \]

Next, we need to find out how much he earns in a 30-day month. We do this by multiplying his daily earnings by the number of days in the month:
\[ \$2.50/\text{day} \times 30 \text{ days} = \$75.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$75.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate Jamie's regular pay for the first 8 hours of work:

\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$160 \]

Since Jamie worked 11 hours in total, she worked 3 additional hours beyond her regular 8 hours. The special hourly rate for these additional hours is 150% of her regular hourly rate:

\[ 150\% \text{ of } \$20 = 1.5 \times \$20 = \$30/\text{hour} \]

Now, let's calculate the pay for the 3 additional hours:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$90 \]

Finally, we add the regular pay and the additional pay to find the total pay for the day:

\[ \$160 + \$90 = \$250 \]

So, Jamie was paid \(\boxed{250}\) dollars for her work on Tuesday."
"The zookeeper counts 12 female lions. Since there are half as many male lions, there are \(12 \div 2 = 6\) male lions. Adding the 14 lion cubs, the total number of lions in the enclosure is \(12 + 6 + 14 = 32\).

"First, we need to calculate the discount on the jeans. The jeans are 25% off, and the original price is $40. 

To find the discount amount:
\[ \text{Discount} = 25\% \times 40 = 0.25 \times 40 = 10 \]

So, the price of the jeans after the discount is:
\[ \text{Discounted Price} = 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Mike pays with a $50.00 bill. To find out how much money he will have left over, we subtract the price of the jeans from the amount he paid:
\[ \text{Change} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Mike will have left over is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"

"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the number of trees planted by the teachers, then add these two numbers together.

1. **Calculate the number of trees planted by the students:**
   - Each student plants 1 tree.
   - There are 40 classes, and each class has 25 students.
   - Therefore, the total number of students is \(40 \times 25 = 1000\).
   - So, the total number of trees planted by the students is \(1000 \times 1 = 1000\).

2. **Calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:**
   - Each teacher plants 2 trees.
   - There are 40 classes, and each class has 3 teachers.
   - Therefore, the total number of teachers is \(40 \times 3 = 120\).
   - So, the total number of trees planted by the teachers is \(120 \times 2 = 240\).

3. **Calculate the total number of trees planted:**
   - The total number of trees is the sum of the trees planted by the students and the trees planted by the teachers.
   - Therefore, the total number of trees is \(1000 + 240 = 1240\).

"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total current stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the first part of her schedule:

- Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks.
- There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks have 14 days.
- Half an hour each day for 14 days is \(0.5 \times 14 = 7\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the second part of her schedule:

- Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- 2 hours each day for 7 days is \(2 \times 7 = 14\) hours.

Now, let's add the hours from both parts of her schedule:

- Total hours played = \(7 + 14 = 21\) hours.

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:

- \(30 - 21 = 9\) hours.

So, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement."

"First, let's determine the total number of glass chips Milo has. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:
\[ 72 \times 2 = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, the number of square inches he can make is:
\[ \frac{144}{12} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. Let's denote the length of the mosaic as \( L \) inches. The area of the mosaic, which is the product of its height and length, is:
\[ 3 \times L = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the length of the mosaic Milo can make is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts, so the total amount consumed by these students is:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts, so the total amount consumed by these students is:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts. Therefore, the total amount of tea in gallons is:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 candies, which means he needed to order more to meet the demand. He then ordered an additional 100 candies. 

To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we first calculate the total number of candies he now has:

\[ 100 \text{ (initial candies)} + 100 \text{ (additional candies)} = 200 \text{ candies} \]

Dale has sold 150 candies out of the 200 he now has. To find out how many he still needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies he has sold from the total number of candies he now has:

\[ 200 \text{ (total candies)} - 150 \text{ (sold candies)} = 50 \text{ candies} \]

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month, starting from 10 students at the beginning of the year.

1. **End of January**: The number of students doubles.
   \[
   10 \times 2 = 20
   \]

2. **End of February**: The number of students doubles again.
   \[
   20 \times 2 = 40
   \]

3. **End of March**: The number of students doubles again.
   \[
   40 \times 2 = 80
   \]

4. **End of April**: The number of students doubles again.
   \[
   80 \times 2 = 160

Therefore, the number of additional students that have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. He made $105 during the week. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25 \text{ per branch}} = 420 \text{ branches}
\]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420 \text{ branches}}{7 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ branches per day}
\]

Therefore, on average, Felix climbed \(\boxed{60}\) branches per day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picked:

1. **3 flowers with 5 petals each:**
   \[
   3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals}
   \]

2. **4 flowers with 6 petals each:**
   \[
   4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals}
   \]

3. **5 flowers with 4 petals each:**
   \[
   5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals}
   \]

4. **6 flowers with 7 petals each:**
   \[
   6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals}
   \]

Next, we sum these amounts to find the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals}
\]

Rose drops 1 of each type of flower, so she drops:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[
5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals}

"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they use:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Next, we need to account for the marshmallows that were dropped on the ground. They dropped 3 marshmallows, so we subtract these from the total number of marshmallows initially in the bag:

\[ 35 - 3 = 32 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Now, we subtract the marshmallows used by John and DeSean from the remaining marshmallows:

\[ 32 - 18 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

These 14 marshmallows are the ones left to make more S'mores. Since John and DeSean are sharing the remaining marshmallows equally, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2:

\[ 14 \div 2 = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

So, each kid can have 7 more S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's break down the time each person can play with one quarter:

1. Jack can play for 20 minutes.
2. Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes each.
3. The better friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes.

Next, we calculate the total time each person can play with one quarter:
- Jack: 20 minutes
- Two friends: 10 minutes each
- Better friend: 30 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total time they can play in 4 hours (240 minutes):
- Jack can play \(\frac{240}{20} = 12\) times.
- Each of the two friends can play \(\frac{240}{10} = 24\) times.
- The better friend can play \(\frac{240}{30} = 8\) times.

Adding these up gives the total number of quarters used:
- Jack: 12 quarters
- Two friends: \(2 \times 24 = 48\) quarters
- Better friend: 8 quarters

The total number of quarters used is \(12 + 48 + 8 = 68\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's define the variables for the quantities of each ingredient:
- Let \( S \) be the amount of salt (in ounces).
- Let \( O \) be the amount of oil (in ounces).
- Let \( F \) be the amount of fragrance (in ounces).
- Let \( Z \) be the amount of citrus zest (in ounces).
- Let \( G \) be the amount of sugar (in ounces).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. She uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so \( S = G \).
2. She uses twice as much oil as salt, so \( O = 2S \).
3. She uses twice as much salt as citrus zest, so \( S = 2Z \).
4. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so \( Z = F \).

Since the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, we can write the equation:
\[ S + O + F + Z + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation, we get:
\[ S + 2S + Z + Z + S = 10 \]
\[ 4S + 2Z = 10 \]

Since \( S = 2Z \), we can substitute \( S \) with \( 2Z \) in the equation:
\[ 4(2Z) + 2Z = 10 \]
\[ 8Z + 2Z = 10 \]
\[ 10Z = 10 \]
\[ Z = 1 \]

Now, we can find \( S \):
\[ S = 2Z = 2 \times 1 = 2 \]

Next, we find \( O \):
\[ O = 2S = 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

So, the amount of oil used is \( 4 \) ounces.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the overall amount spent:
- Total cost of goats: $1500
- Total cost of cows: $3000
- Therefore, the total amount spent is \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:
4500 dollars."

Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"First, let's determine how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. So, the number of cars he gives away is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to calculate how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving some away. Initially, Joe had 40 cars. After selling 8 cars and giving away 16 cars, the number of cars he remains with is:

\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final number of cars Joe remains with is:

"First, we need to determine how much money the students raised in total. The charity raised a total of $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, and they all raised the same amount. So, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

\[ 125,000 \div 20 = 6,250 \]

Therefore, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\)."
"On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day, which is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) hours.

The total time Sandy walked over the two days is \( 8 + 4 = 12 \) hours.

To convert this total time into minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ 5 \text{ tasks/cycle} \times \$1.20 \text{ per task} = \$6.00 \text{ per cycle} \]

Next, calculate the daily earnings:
\[ 30 \text{ cycles/day} \times \$6.00 \text{ per cycle} = \$180.00 \text{ per day} \]

Finally, calculate the weekly earnings for a 7-day work week:
\[ 7 \text{ days/week} \times \$180.00 \text{ per day} = \$1260.00 \text{ per week} \]

So, John makes \(\$1260.00\) in a full 7-day week."
"To find out how many total points Sasha scored during both games, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Game:**
   - Sasha scored 14 points.
   - Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points.

2. **Second Game:**
   - The second game was at Julie's home court.
   - Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.

3. **Total Points:**
   - Sasha's total points are the sum of her points in both games: \(14 + 4 = 18\).

Therefore, Sasha scored a total of 18 points during both games."
"First, calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought:

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food."
"Let's define the number of cards each person has with variables:
- Let \( P \) be the number of cards PJ has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of cards Smendrick has.
- Let \( B \) be the number of cards Becca has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( B = S + 12 \)
2. \( S = 3P \)
3. The total number of cards is 341, so \( B + S + P = 341 \).

First, substitute \( S = 3P \) into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 3P + 12 \]

Now, substitute \( B \) and \( S \) in terms of \( P \) into the total cards equation:
\[ (3P + 12) + 3P + P = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P = 329 \]
\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find \( S \) and \( B \):
\[ S = 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \]
\[ B = S + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, Becca has \( 153 \) cards.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{153} \]"
"To find out how many eggs Cindy had altogether, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Green Eggs**: Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. **Blue Eggs**: She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones. So, the number of blue eggs is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
3. **Pink Eggs**: She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs. So, the number of pink eggs is \(10 - 1 = 9\).
4. **Yellow Eggs**: She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. So, the number of yellow eggs is \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\).

Now, let's sum up all the eggs:
- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10

"To determine how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the production for the first three weeks and then find out how much is left for the fourth week.

1. **First Week Production:**
   Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

2. **Second Week Production:**
   Boris produces half as much as the first week. Therefore, the production for the second week is:
   \[
   \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

3. **Third Week Production:**
   Boris produces three times as much as the first week. Therefore, the production for the third week is:
   \[
   3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

4. **Total Production for the First Three Weeks:**
   Adding the production from the first three weeks:
   \[
   8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

5. **Fourth Week Production:**
   Since Boris produces a total of 50,000 bars of chocolate each month, the production for the fourth week is the remaining amount after the first three weeks:
   \[
   50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

Therefore, the production for the fourth week is:

1. **First Segment:**
   - Speed: 8 miles per hour
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 8 miles/hour × 4 hours = 32 miles

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Speed: 8 miles per hour
   - Time: 6 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 8 miles/hour × 6 hours = 48 miles

3. **Total Distance:**
   - Total Distance = Distance of First Segment + Distance of Second Segment
   - Total Distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

Therefore, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles."
"First, let's determine the speed of the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, the total time for one kangaroo to cross the highway would also be 18 hours, since they are traveling at the same speed.

The distance \(D\) can be calculated using the formula \(D = \text{speed} \times \text{time}\). For one kangaroo, the distance \(D\) is:
\[ D = \text{speed} \times 18 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's consider the turtles. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo. Therefore, the speed of each turtle is:
\[ \text{speed of a turtle} = \frac{\text{speed of a kangaroo}}{2} \]

Using the distance formula again, the distance \(D\) for one turtle to cross the highway is:
\[ D = \text{speed of a turtle} \times \text{time} \]
\[ D = \frac{\text{speed of a kangaroo}}{2} \times \text{time} \]

Since the distance \(D\) is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles, we can set the two expressions for \(D\) equal to each other:
\[ \text{speed of a kangaroo} \times 18 = \frac{\text{speed of a kangaroo}}{2} \times \text{time} \]

We can cancel the speed of the kangaroo from both sides of the equation:
\[ 18 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{time} \]

To find the time, we solve for \(\text{time}\):
\[ \text{time} = 18 \times 2 = 36 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, a total of \(\boxed{36}\) hours to cross the highway."
"First, let's determine the number of clay dishes each person makes based on the information given.

1. Kora made 20 dishes.
2. Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory makes \(20 + 20 = 40\) dishes.
3. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada makes \(2 \times 40 = 80\) dishes.

Now, we add the number of dishes each person made to find the total number of dishes:
\[20 \text{ (Kora)} + 40 \text{ (Rory)} + 80 \text{ (Jada)} = 140\]

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes they all make together is \(\boxed{140}\)."

"First, calculate the total milk production from the current 3 cows:
- Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day.
- Therefore, 3 cows produce \(3 \times 5 = 15\) liters of milk a day.

Next, determine how much more milk is needed to reach 25 liters a day:
- The farmer needs \(25 - 15 = 10\) more liters of milk a day.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, calculate how many more cows are needed to produce the additional 10 liters:
- The number of additional cows needed is \(10 \div 5 = 2\).

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue that is not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and then sum these portions.

1. For the first glue stick, which has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left, the unused portion is \( 1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6} \). Since the original length of each glue stick is 12 millimeters, the unused length is \( 12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \) millimeters.

2. For the second glue stick, which has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left, the unused portion is \( 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \). The unused length is \( 12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \) millimeters.

3. For the third glue stick, which has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left, the unused portion is \( 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \). The unused length is \( 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \) millimeters.

Adding these unused lengths together, we get:
\[ 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \]

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 millimeters."

So, the amount of money Craig has left is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks. Therefore, if Jack's socks are \( S \), then \( 2S = 60 \). Solving for \( S \), we get \( S = 30 \) (Jack has 30 socks).
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. So, Peter's socks are \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. So, Peter's dishes are \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \).

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Jack's total: \( 30 \) socks + \( 60 \) dishes = \( 90 \)
- Peter's total: \( 60 \) socks + \( 30 \) dishes = \( 90 \)

"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to use the formula for simple interest:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = P \times r \times t \]

where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount ($300),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \) of $300, or 0.75 in decimal form),
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for (3 years).

First, calculate the annual interest:

\[ \text{Annual Interest} = 300 \times 0.75 = 225 \]

Since the interest is simple, it does not compound. Therefore, the total interest over 3 years is:

\[ \text{Total Interest} = 225 \times 3 = 675 \]

Now, add the total interest to the principal to find the total amount:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

\frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 15 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms."
"In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year. So, the number of homes built in the second year is:
\[ 12 \times 3 = 36 \]

By the end of the second year, the total number of homes built is:
\[ 12 + 36 = 48 \]

In the third year, they will double the total number of homes built by the end of the second year. So, the number of homes built in the third year is:
\[ 48 \times 2 = 96 \]

Adding the homes built in the third year to the total from the first two years, the total number of homes built over the next three years is:
\[ 48 + 96 = 144 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 144 \]"
"Let's define the variables for the ages of the individuals:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( M \) be the age of the mother.
- Let \( A \) be the age of the person in question (you).

From the problem, we can write the following equations:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( A = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( A = S + 2 \).
3. Your mother's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all their ages is 87: \( A + B + S + M = 87 \).

First, we can express \( S \) and \( M \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( A = B - 3 \), we get \( S = A - 2 = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \).
- From \( M = 3B - 1 \).

Now substitute \( A \), \( S \), and \( M \) into the sum equation:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87. \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87, \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87. \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96. \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16. \]

Now, substitute \( B = 16 \) back into the equation for \( A \):
\[ A = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13. \]

So, you are \(\boxed{13}\) years old."
"First, we need to determine the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we calculate:

\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks/student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy. Each pack contains 8 glue sticks. To find the number of packs required, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ \frac{54 \text{ glue sticks}}{8 \text{ glue sticks/pack}} = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and he needs to ensure he has enough glue sticks, he must round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles, so the new amount is:
\[ 4000 \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons} \]

On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day is:
\[ 8000 + 6000 = 14000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is:
\[ 14000 \text{ gallons} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to model the exponential growth of the infection over three days. Each infected person infects six others each day, so the number of new infections each day is six times the number of infected people from the previous day.

Let's break it down day by day:

**Day 0:**
- Initial number of infected people: 10

**Day 1:**
- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections: \(10 \times 6 = 60\)
- Total infected people: \(10 + 60 = 70\)

**Day 2:**
- Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections: \(70 \times 6 = 420\)
- Total infected people: \(70 + 420 = 490\)

**Day 3:**
- Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections: \(490 \times 6 = 2940\)
- Total infected people: \(490 + 2940 = 3430\)

Therefore, after three days, the total number of infected people is 3430."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tips Rafaela received. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ customers} \times \$20 \text{ per customer} = \$800 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips, we calculate:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$800 = 0.10 \times \$800 = \$80 \]

Since Julieta received 10% less, we subtract this amount from Rafaela's total tips:

\[ \$800 - \$80 = \$720 \]

Now, to find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their individual totals together:

\[ \$800 + \$720 = \$1520 \]

Therefore, the total amount of tips received by Julieta and Rafaela altogether is:

\[ \$1520 \]"
"Jennifer initially had 12 oranges.

She gave 2 oranges to each of her three daughters, which totals:
\[ 2 \text{ oranges/daughter} \times 3 \text{ daughters} = 6 \text{ oranges} \]

She also gave 3 oranges to her son.

So, the total number of oranges given away is:
\[ 6 \text{ oranges} + 3 \text{ oranges} = 9 \text{ oranges} \]

Therefore, the number of oranges Jennifer remained with is:
\[ 12 \text{ oranges} - 9 \text{ oranges} = 3 \text{ oranges} \]

**Final Answer: 3 oranges**"
"First, let's determine the number of badges each person earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge every month. In a year (12 months), Claire earns:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so she earns:
\[ \frac{1 \text{ badge}}{2} = 0.5 \text{ badges/month} \]
In a year, Amber earns:
\[ 0.5 \text{ badges/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so in a year, Wendy earns:
\[ 3 \times 12 \text{ badges} = 36 \text{ badges} \]

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:
\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

Therefore, Wendy earns \(\boxed{30}\) more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame."
"First, let's determine how many hours Paige spent baking. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours.

Next, we calculate how many banana bread loaves she baked in those 5 hours. Since she bakes 2 loaves per hour, in 5 hours she baked:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices from 10 loaves is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. Therefore, the total amount raised from selling all the slices is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times \$0.50/\text{slice} = \$40.00 \]

So, the final amount raised is:
\[ \$40.00 \]"
"If Gretchen has 70 gold coins and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, then she has \(70 - 30 = 40\) silver coins.

Gretchen had a total of 110 coins."
"First, calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students. Since there are 50 students and each student was given 10 burritos, the total number of burritos consumed by the students is:

\[ 50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos/student} = 500 \text{ burritos} \]

Next, add the number of burritos Mr. George ate to the total consumed by the students:

\[ 500 \text{ burritos} + 20 \text{ burritos} = 520 \text{ burritos} \]

Finally, subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered to find the number of leftover burritos:

\[ 600 \text{ burritos} - 520 \text{ burritos} = 80 \text{ burritos} \]

Therefore, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is:

\[ 80 \]"
"Let's define the variables for the number of each type of car:
- Let \( R \) be the number of red cars.
- Let \( G \) be the number of green cars.
- Let \( B \) be the number of blue cars.
- Let \( Y \) be the number of yellow cars.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( R = 12 \)
2. \( G = R - 2 \)
3. \( B = 3G \)
4. The total number of cars is 75, so \( R + G + B + Y = 75 \).

First, calculate the number of green cars:
\[ G = R - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10 \]

Next, calculate the number of blue cars:
\[ B = 3G = 3 \times 10 = 30 \]

Now, substitute the values of \( R \), \( G \), and \( B \) into the total number of cars equation to find \( Y \):
\[ R + G + B + Y = 75 \]
\[ 12 + 10 + 30 + Y = 75 \]
\[ 52 + Y = 75 \]
\[ Y = 75 - 52 \]
\[ Y = 23 \]

Therefore, the number of yellow cars is \(\boxed{23}\)."
"Let's define the number of books each person has with variables:
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (Together, they have 85 books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, we can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation to eliminate \( S \) and \( A \).

From equation 2, we have \( S = A + 25 \). Substituting \( S \) in the first equation:
\[ (A + 25) + A + F = 85 \]
\[ 2A + F + 25 = 85 \]
\[ 2A + F = 60 \]

From equation 3, we have \( A = F - 12 \). Substituting \( A \) in the equation \( 2A + F = 60 \):
\[ 2(F - 12) + F = 60 \]
\[ 2F - 24 + F = 60 \]
\[ 3F - 24 = 60 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \( 28 \) books.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{28} \]"
"First, let's determine the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh:

\[ 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much the carrots weigh. The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so:

\[ 10 \text{ pounds} - 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots."
"To determine how much Greg will spend on jello, we need to follow these steps:

"First, calculate the total amount Madeline pays per month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the $400 monthly cost, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \]

This means Madeline pays $240 per month. Since the total cost is $400, Keenan pays the remaining 40%:

\[ 400 - 240 = 160 \]

So, Keenan pays $160 per month. To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we divide the monthly amount by 4 (since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month):

\[ \frac{160}{4} = 40 \]

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week."

"First, let's determine how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. He has 300 chickens and plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of them.

\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = 300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180 \]

Next, we know that Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000 by selling these chickens at $50 each. The total revenue from selling 180 chickens at $50 each is:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

This total revenue of $9000 includes the cost of the chickens and the $2000 profit. Therefore, the cost of the chickens he took to the market is:

\[ \text{Cost of chickens} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Profit} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

Since Isaias bought 180 chickens, the cost per chicken is:

\[ \text{Cost per chicken} = \frac{7000}{180} \approx 38.89 \]

However, the question asks for the total amount Isaias bought the chickens for, which is $7000.

\[ \boxed{7000} \]"
"Julie sold 14 glasses of lemonade. The total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32. Since the boys (Micah and Mitchell) sold an equal number of glasses, we can find out how many glasses Micah sold by first determining how many glasses the boys sold in total.

The total number of glasses sold by Julie and the boys is 32. Subtracting the number of glasses Julie sold from the total gives us the number of glasses sold by the boys:
\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses by 2 to find out how many glasses each boy sold:
\[ 18 \div 2 = 9 \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses of lemonade. To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold:
\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

Final answer:

"First, let's determine how much Iris spent on the manicure. Since she spent 1/4 as much on the manicure as she did on her hair, we calculate:

\[ \text{Manicure cost} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the pedicure. She spent 3/4 as much on the pedicure as she did on the manicure, so:

\[ \text{Pedicure cost} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent at the spa:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Hair cost} + \text{Manicure cost} + \text{Pedicure cost} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575 \]

So, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is:

"First, we calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling the rope. Since the rope is 20 meters long and she sells it for $2 per meter, the total amount of money she will get is:

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and we assume Sarah buys a rope of the same length (20 meters) for the new one. Therefore, the cost of the new rope is:

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$30 \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the money Sarah has to find out how much money she will have left over:

\[ \$40 - \$30 = \$10 \]

So, the amount of money Sarah will have left over after she buys the new rope is:

"To solve this problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age.

1. **Determine Melanie's current age:**
   - In 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old.
   - Therefore, her current age is \(18 - 10 = 8\) years old.

2. **Set up the equation for when her age will be thrice her current age:**
   - Let \(x\) be the number of years from now when Melanie's age will be thrice her current age.
   - Her age in \(x\) years will be \(8 + x\).
   - We need this to be equal to three times her current age, which is \(3 \times 8 = 24\).

3. **Formulate and solve the equation:**
   \[
   8 + x = 24
   \]
   \[
   x = 24 - 8

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item category:

1. **Bacon:**
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.
   - Cost per pack of bacon = $10 / 5 = $2.

2. **Chicken:**
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Cost per packet of chicken = 2 * $2 = $4.
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   - Total cost for chicken = 6 * $4 = $24.

3. **Strawberries:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries.
   - Total cost for strawberries = 3 * $4 = $12.

4. **Apples:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Cost per pack of apples = $4 / 2 = $2.
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples.
   - Total cost for apples = 7 * $2 = $14.

Next, we sum up the total cost of all items:
- Total cost = Cost of bacon + Cost of chicken + Cost of strawberries + Cost of apples
- Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

Finally, we subtract the total cost from Kelly's budget to find out how much money she has left:
- Kelly's budget = $65.
- Money left = $65 - $60 = $5.

"Let's denote the usual length of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes.

According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, plus a 15-minute encore. This can be expressed as:
\[ 2x + 15 \]

We know that the runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is \( 25 \) minutes.

Final answer:
\[ 25 \]"

So, the total number of chimichangas made on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays is 500."
"First, we need to determine how many microphones will not find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. Given that 20% of the 50 microphones won't fit, we calculate 20% of 50:

\[ 20\% \times 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 microphones won't find any space to fit in. This means the remaining microphones that can be paired are:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of microphones can be made from these 40 microphones. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we divide 40 by 2:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged on the stage is:

   \]
   Therefore, 4 birds are flying overhead.
3. Jerry also counts 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, we need to calculate \(3 \times 8\):
   \[
   3 \times 8 = 24
   \]
   Therefore, 24 birds are feeding.

Now, we add up all the birds Jerry counts:
\[
6 \text{ (nesting)} + 4 \text{ (flying overhead)} + 24 \text{ (feeding)} = 34
\]

So, the total number of birds Jerry counts is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"Lani initially baked 55 cookies. She ate 5 cookies, so the number of cookies left is:

\[ 55 - 5 = 50 \]

These 50 cookies were then placed equally into 5 jars. To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of jars:

\[ 50 \div 5 = 10 \]

So, there were 10 cookies in each jar."
"First, calculate the total number of petals on the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals on the orchids is \(5 \times 5 = 25\).

Next, calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals on the daisies is \(4 \times 10 = 40\).

Now, find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids:
- The difference is \(40 - 25 = 15\).

So, the daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids."
"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25
\]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[
\text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75
\]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants. So, we calculate the number of outdoor plants as follows:

\[
\text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50
\]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. Therefore, the number of flowering plants is:

\[
\text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25
\]

To find the percentage of flowering plants out of the total 100 plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\%
\]

So, the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants is:

\[
25\%
\]"
"Given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can find the speed of a thingamabob first.

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

Since a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob, we can now calculate the speed of a whirligig.

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 = 55 \text{ meters per second} \]

Therefore, the speed of a whirligig is 55 meters per second."
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( C \) be the cost of one carrot.
- The cost of the salad is given as $6.
- The cost of the yogurt is half the price of the salad, so it is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) dollars.

Ellen eats two carrots, one salad, and one yogurt every day. The total cost for these items is $11. We can set up the following equation based on the given information:

\[ 2C + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 2C + 9 = 11 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides to isolate the term with \( C \):

\[ 2C = 2 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( C \):

\[ C = 1 \]

So, the cost of one carrot is \( \boxed{1} \) dollar."
"First, let's calculate Mark's new hourly wage after the raise. He used to make $10 an hour and his pay was increased by $2 per hour. So, his new hourly wage is:

\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week. Therefore, the total number of hours he works in a week is:

\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week:

\[ 12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 480 \]"
"Let's define the variables for the problem:
- Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
- Let \( K \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn.
- Let \( A \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Alba's lawn.
- Let \( p_J \) be the payment per mow for Joe's lawn.
- Let \( p_K \) be the payment per mow for Kamala's lawn.
- Let \( p_A \) be the payment per mow for Alba's lawn.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( K = 3J \) (Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's).
2. \( A = 5J \) (Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's).
3. Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, so \( p_J \cdot J = 6 \).

We need to find the total earnings from mowing lawns and then subtract this from the total earnings to find the earnings from lemonade sales.

First, let's express the total earnings from mowing lawns:
\[ \text{Total earnings from mowing} = p_J \cdot J + p_K \cdot K + p_A \cdot A \]

Since \( K = 3J \) and \( A = 5J \), we can substitute these into the equation:
\[ \text{Total earnings from mowing} = p_J \cdot J + p_K \cdot 3J + p_A \cdot 5J \]
\[ \text{Total earnings from mowing} = J (p_J + 3p_K + 5p_A) \]

We know \( p_J \cdot J = 6 \), so \( p_J = \frac{6}{J} \). Substituting \( p_J \) into the equation:
\[ \text{Total earnings from mowing} = J \left( \frac{6}{J} + 3p_K + 5p_A \right) \]
\[ \text{Total earnings from mowing} = 6 + 3Jp_K + 5Jp_A \]

We need to find the values of \( p_K \) and \( p_A \). However, the problem does not provide these values directly. But we can use the total earnings to find the answer. The total earnings from all activities (lemonade sales and mowing) is $80. Let \( L \) be the earnings from lemonade sales. Then:
\[ L + \text{Total earnings from mowing} = 80 \]
\[ L + 6 + 3Jp_K + 5Jp_A = 80 \]
\[ L = 80 - 6 - 3Jp_K - 5Jp_A \]
\[ L = 74 - 3Jp_K - 5Jp_A \]

Since the problem does not provide the values of \( p_K \) and \( p_A \), we can infer that the total earnings from mowing lawns is the only part that is directly calculable with the given information. The problem simplifies to finding the earnings from lemonade sales by subtracting the known mowing earnings from the total earnings.

Given the total earnings and the mowing earnings, the earnings from lemonade sales are:
\[ L = 80 - 6 = 74 \]

Thus, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[ \boxed{74} \]"
"First, let's determine Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, and Martin's weight is 55 kg, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we calculate Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so:

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we find Harry's weight. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so:

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate how much John earns from renting out his car each month.

John rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, and he gets paid $25 an hour. So, the total hours he rents out his car each month is:
\[ 10 \text{ times} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate his total earnings from renting the car:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$750 \]

Now, we need to subtract his car payment from his total earnings to find his profit:
\[ \$750 - \$500 = \$250 \]

So, the profit John makes on his car is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"First, let's determine how many notebooks Martha originally had. Since Martha ended up with 7 notebooks after buying 5 more, she originally had:

\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \text{ notebooks} \]

Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. Therefore, Joseph had:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ notebooks} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has compared to Joseph after her purchase. Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph still has 6 notebooks. The difference is:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

Final answer:
\[ 1 \]"
"First, we need to calculate the distance Anis rowed. Anis rowed \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more miles than Dijana. Since Dijana rowed 50 miles, we calculate Anis's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Anis's distance} = 50 + \left( \frac{1}{5} \times 50 \right) \]
\[ \text{Anis's distance} = 50 + 10 \]
\[ \text{Anis's distance} = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Dijana's distance} + \text{Anis's distance} \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = 50 + 60 \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = 110 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is 110 miles."
"First, we need to account for the cookies Susan's husband took. Susan originally made 100 cookies, and her husband took 4 for himself. So, we subtract 4 from 100:

\[ 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Now, we need to divide the remaining 96 cookies equally among her 6 nephews. We do this by dividing 96 by 6:

\[ 96 \div 6 = 16 \]

So, each of Susan’s nephews will get 16 cookies."
"Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages.

Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.

So, the total number of pages Denise read is \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.

Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and 0 pages today, so he read a total of \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages Daniel read from the total pages Denise read: \(28 - 13 = 15\).

Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel."
"First, let's determine the total amount of soup Calvin has. The pot can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. Since Calvin is an adult, we can use the adult's bowl measurement as the standard. Therefore, the total amount of soup is equivalent to 4 adult bowls.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of bowls of soup that will be consumed by Calvin and his family. Calvin and his wife are adults, and they will each have one bowl, so that's 2 bowls for the adults. The two children will each have one bowl, so that's 2 bowls for the children. In total, they will consume 2 (adults) + 2 (children) = 4 bowls of soup.

Since the total amount of soup is 4 adult bowls and they will consume 4 bowls, there will be no soup left over for the children to have additional bowls for lunch. 

Therefore, each child will be able to have 0 bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

0"
"To find out how much William spent in all, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen he bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the notebooks:
- Each notebook costs $1.50.
- William bought five notebooks.

\[ \text{Cost of notebooks} = 5 \times 1.50 = 7.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ballpen:
- Each ballpen costs $0.50.
- William bought one ballpen.

\[ \text{Cost of ballpen} = 1 \times 0.50 = 0.50 \]

Now, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen to find the total amount William spent:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00 \]

Therefore, William spent a total of $8.00."
"To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can break down the problem into two parts: calculating the material needed for the small masks and the material needed for the large masks.

First, let's calculate the material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, to find out how much material is needed for 1 small mask, we divide 2 yards by 4:
  \[
  \text{Material per small mask} = \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards}
  \]
- To find out how much material is needed for 20 small masks, we multiply the material needed for 1 small mask by 20:
  \[
  \text{Material for 20 small masks} = 0.5 \text{ yards/mask} \times 20 \text{ masks} = 10 \text{ yards}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, to find out how much material is needed for 1 large mask, we divide 2.25 yards by 3:
  \[
  \text{Material per large mask} = \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards}
  \]
- To find out how much material is needed for 8 large masks, we multiply the material needed for 1 large mask by 8:
  \[
  \text{Material for 8 large masks} = 0.75 \text{ yards/mask} \times 8 \text{ masks} = 6 \text{ yards}
  \]

Finally, we add the material needed for the small masks and the large masks to get the total material needed:
\[
\text{Total material} = 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards}
\]

Therefore, Jo would need \boxed{16} yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of times Deepa saw the movies.
2. Divide the total amount of money spent by the total number of tickets purchased.

First, we calculate the total number of times Deepa saw the movies:
- There are 9 movies.
- She saw each movie 3 times.

So, the total number of times she saw the movies is:
\[ 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ times} \]

Next, we know she spent $216 in total. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:
\[ \frac{216 \text{ dollars}}{27 \text{ tickets}} = 8 \text{ dollars per ticket} \]

Therefore, the average price she paid per ticket is:
\[ 8 \text{ dollars} \]"
"First, let's break down Harold's daily activities and their durations:

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on these activities:
- Sleep: 10 hours
- Work: 8 hours
- Walk the dog: 1 hour

Total time spent on these activities is \(10 + 8 + 1 = 19\) hours.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the free time Harold has left is:
\[24 - 19 = 5\]

So, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day."
"First, let's determine how many blue shoe boxes Tim uses for fishing. He uses 3 blue shoe boxes.

Initially, Tim has 7 blue shoe boxes. After using 3, the number of blue shoe boxes left is:
\[ 7 - 3 = 4 \]

Next, let's calculate how many red shoe boxes Tim uses for fishing. He uses \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his 9 red shoe boxes:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \]

Initially, Tim has 9 red shoe boxes. After using 3, the number of red shoe boxes left is:
\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \]

So, the number of blue and red shoe boxes left in Tim's box are 4 and 6, respectively.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 4 \text{ blue shoe boxes and } 6 \text{ red shoe boxes} \]"
"First, we determine how many books Joseph originally had. Since Joseph had twice the number of Sarah's books, and Sarah had 9 books, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Joseph originally had 18 books. Next, we account for the fact that Joseph lost 2 of his books. We subtract 2 from the original number of books Joseph had:

\[ 18 - 2 = 16 \]

Therefore, Joseph currently has 16 books. 

Final answer: Joseph currently has 16 books."
"First, let's calculate how many marbles Dean gives to Jamie. Dean gives 1/5 of his 30 marbles to Jamie:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6 \]

So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie.

Next, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald.

Now, let's calculate the total number of marbles Dean gives away:

\[ 6 + 10 = 16 \]

Finally, to find out how many marbles Dean has left, we subtract the total number of marbles he gave away from the original number of marbles:

\[ 30 - 16 = 14 \]

So, Dean has 14 marbles left."
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( D \) be Duncan's current age.
- Let \( A \) be Adam's current age.

From the problem, we know:
- Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).
- Duncan's age eight years ago was \( D - 8 = 60 - 8 = 52 \).
- Adam's age four years ago was \( A - 4 \).

According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This gives us the equation:
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Now, solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = \frac{60}{2} \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be \(\boxed{38}\) years old in 8 years."
"First, let's determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm. We know that Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Adding 100 acres to this amount gives the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, to find the total number of acres for both farms together, we add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

Therefore, the total number of acres for both farms together is:
\[ 700 \text{ acres} \]"
"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, we calculate:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ packages per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. We multiply the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours in a workday:

\[ 40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Now, we calculate how much money he earns. Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, we multiply the number of packages by his pay rate:

\[ 320 \text{ packages} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/package} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday is:

\[ \boxed{64} \]"

\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes. Since he drinks a bottle of water every half hour (30 minutes), we divide 180 minutes by 30 minutes per bottle:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 30 \text{ minutes per bottle} = 6 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( r \) be the number of red balloons.
- Let \( y \) be the number of yellow balloons.

From the problem, we know:
- Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
- Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
- There are 20 red balloons.

We can set up the following equation based on the information given:
\[ 2r + 3y = 58 \]
Since we know \( r = 20 \), we substitute 20 for \( r \) in the equation:
\[ 2(20) + 3y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3y = 58 \]
Next, we solve for \( y \):
\[ 3y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3y = 18 \]
\[ y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is \( y = 6 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs, we first need to calculate the total miles Jon drives in a 30-day month.

Jon drives 100 miles a day. Therefore, in 30 days, he drives:
\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. To find out how many tune-ups he needs, we divide the total miles driven by the number of miles required for a tune-up:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time."
"On Tuesday, Bruce works for 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which is \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

To find the total number of hours Bruce works over these three days, we add the hours from each day together:

\[5 + 10 + 8 = 23\]

Bruce works a total of 23 hours in all these three days."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of money Julia and Nadine had combined and then find out how much each of them received from their mother.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items they bought:
1. The cake costs $11.
2. The balloons: Since 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The ice cream: 2 tubs of ice cream cost $7 each, so the total cost for 2 tubs is:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to buy these items, the total amount of money they had combined is $28. Since they had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total amount by 2 to find out how much each of them received:
\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14."

"First, let's determine the number of students playing volleyball. Since there are twice as many students playing volleyball as there are playing tennis, and there are 6 students playing tennis, we calculate the number of volleyball players as follows:

\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of students playing tennis and volleyball:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

Now, we add the number of students playing soccer. There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so the total number of soccer players is:

\[ 16 + 22 = 38 \]

Finally, we add the number of students playing tennis and volleyball to the number of students playing soccer to get the total number of students:

\[ 18 + 38 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total number of students is:

\[ 56 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since there are 30 students and each sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Cats**: Larry has 3 cats.
2. **Dogs**: He has 3 times as many dogs as cats. So, the number of dogs = \(3 \times 3 = 9\).
3. **Rabbits**: He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. So, the number of rabbits = \(9 - 2 = 7\).
4. **Fish**: He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. So, the number of fish = \(3 \times 7 = 21\).
5. **Gerbils**: He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has. So, the number of gerbils = \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\).

Now, let's sum up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\).

"First, let's determine how many slices Josh can eat in a day. Since Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, and Abby eats 2 slices a day, Josh eats \(2 \times 2 = 4\) slices a day.

Next, we calculate the total number of slices both Abby and Josh can eat in one day. Together, they eat \(2 + 4 = 6\) slices a day.

Now, we need to find out how many days the loaf of bread will last. The loaf has 24 slices, and they eat 6 slices a day. Therefore, the number of days the loaf will last is \(24 \div 6 = 4\).

So, the loaf of bread will last for \(\boxed{4}\) days."
"Martha started collecting shells when she was 5 years old and continued until her 10th birthday. This means she collected shells for \(10 - 5 = 5\) years. Since she collects one shell every month, we need to calculate the total number of months in 5 years.

There are 12 months in a year, so in 5 years, the total number of months is \(5 \times 12 = 60\).

Therefore, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected \(\boxed{60}\) shells."
"Lana has 27 cups of tea in total. She divides these into 3 rows, so each row contains:

\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

In each row, she creates an equal amount of chamomile and mint tea cups. Therefore, in each row, the number of chamomile tea cups is equal to the number of mint tea cups. Let's denote the number of chamomile tea cups in each row as \( x \). Consequently, the number of mint tea cups in each row is also \( x \). Thus, the total number of cups in each row is:

\[ x + x = 2x \]

Since each row has 9 cups, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2x = 9 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \]

Therefore, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:

\[ \boxed{4.5} \]"
"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to first understand the time constraints and the number of trips the sloth can make in that time.

1. **Time per Trip**: The sloth takes 4 hours for each trip down the tree, picking berries, and climbing back up.
2. **Total Time Available**: The sloth has 8 hours to collect berries.

Given these constraints, we can calculate the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours:
\[ \text{Number of trips} = \frac{\text{Total time available}}{\text{Time per trip}} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Next, we need to determine how many berries the sloth needs to pick up per trip to collect a total of 24 berries in these 2 trips:
\[ \text{Berries per trip} = \frac{\text{Total berries}}{\text{Number of trips}} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground to collect 24 berries in 8 hours is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much water is transferred from the pool to the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, we calculate:

\[ \text{Water in the tank} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much water is used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so over 6 days, the total amount of water used is:

\[ \text{Water used in 6 days} = 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank to find the remaining water:

\[ \text{Water remaining in the tank} = 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \boxed{2000} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Colby has spent so far on movies, popcorn, and candy.

1. **Movies:**
   - Colby has seen 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays, and each ticket costs $10.
   - He has also seen 8 movies on other days, and each ticket costs $7.
   - Total spent on movies: \(5 \times 10 + 8 \times 7 = 50 + 56 = 106\)

2. **Popcorn:**
   - Colby has had 2 tubs of popcorn, and each tub costs $8.
   - Total spent on popcorn: \(2 \times 8 = 16\)

3. **Candy:**
   - Colby has had 4 boxes of candy, and each box costs $2.
   - Total spent on candy: \(4 \times 2 = 8\)

4. **Total spent so far:**
   - Total spent on movies, popcorn, and candy: \(106 + 16 + 8 = 130\)

5. **Remaining money:**
   - Colby's parents give him $150 each month.
   - Remaining money: \(150 - 130 = 20\)

6. **Cost of one movie on a Friday or Saturday:**
   - $10

7. **Cost of one movie on any other day:**
   - $7

8. **Cost of one tub of popcorn:**
   - $8

9. **Cost of one box of candy:**
   - $2

10. **Cost of one movie and one tub of popcorn on a Friday or Saturday:**
    - \(10 + 8 = 18\)

11. **Cost of one movie and one box of candy on a Friday or Saturday:**
    - \(10 + 2 = 12\)

12. **Cost of one movie and one tub of popcorn on any other day:**
    - \(7 + 8 = 15\)

13. **Cost of one movie and one box of candy on any other day:**
    - \(7 + 2 = 9\)

Since it is the last day of the month and it's a Friday, Colby can only see movies on Friday or Saturday. The cost of one movie and one tub of popcorn on a Friday or Saturday is $18, and the cost of one movie and one box of candy on a Friday or Saturday is $12. 

14. **Determine how many movies he can see:**
    - If he buys a movie and a tub of popcorn, he spends $18 per movie.
    - If he buys a movie and a box of candy, he spends $12 per movie.
    - With $20 remaining, he can buy 1 movie and a box of candy because \(20 \div 12 = 1.67\), which means he can afford 1 movie and a box of candy.

Therefore, the number of movies Colby can see is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"First, let's calculate the calorie content for the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins.

1. **Calories in a normal cinnamon roll**: 600 calories.
2. **Calories in a mini cinnamon roll**: \( \frac{1}{3} \) of 600 calories = \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \) calories.

3. **Calories in a normal blueberry muffin**: 450 calories.
4. **Calories in a mini blueberry muffin**: \( \frac{1}{3} \) of 450 calories = \( \frac{450}{3} = 150 \) calories.

Next, we calculate the total calories for all the mini pastries:

5. **Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls**: 200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories each = 40,000 calories.
6. **Total calories from mini blueberry muffins**: 300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories each = 45,000 calories.

Finally, we add the total calories from both types of pastries:

7. **Total calories from all pastries**: 40,000 calories + 45,000 calories = 85,000 calories.

**Final Answer:**
85,000 calories."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the week and then divide by the number of days.

1. **Monday**: 39 Junebugs
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
3. **Wednesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
4. **Thursday**: 48 Junebugs
5. **Friday**: 57 Junebugs

Now, we sum these amounts to get the total number of Junebugs removed over the week:
\[ 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 \]

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 39 + 78 = 117 \]
\[ 117 + 78 = 195 \]
\[ 195 + 48 = 243 \]
\[ 243 + 57 = 300 \]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we divide this total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday) to find the average:
\[ \frac{300}{5} = 60 \]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is:
\[ 60 \]"
"First, calculate the distance traveled by the bus:
- The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance traveled by the bus = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

Next, calculate the distance traveled by the car:
- The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance traveled by the car = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, find the difference in distance traveled by the bus and the car:
- Difference = Distance traveled by the bus - Distance traveled by the car
- Difference = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of all the other toys and then subtract that total from the overall number of toys Sophie has.

1. The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
2. The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
3. The tower of stacking rings has 9 rings.
4. The total number of toys is 62.

First, we add the number of building blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Next, we subtract this sum from the total number of toys to find out how many bouncy balls there are:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

So, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14."
"Let's define the variables for the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as follows:
- Let \( P \) be the age of Peter.
- Let \( p \) be the age of Paul.
- Let \( j \) be the age of Jean.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
   \[
   P + p + j = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
   \[
   p = j + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.
   \[
   P = p + j
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( j \):
\[
P = (j + 10) + j = 2j + 10
\]

Now, we substitute \( P = 2j + 10 \) and \( p = j + 10 \) into the first equation:
\[
(2j + 10) + (j + 10) + j = 100
\]
Simplify the left side:
\[
2j + 10 + j + 10 + j = 100
\]
\[
4j + 20 = 100
\]
Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4j = 80
\]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[
j = 20
\]

Now that we have \( j = 20 \), we can find \( p \) and \( P \):
\[
p = j + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2j + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Therefore, the age of Peter is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"First, let's calculate the number of water balloons each person initially received:

- Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons. So, the total number of balloons given to her friends is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) balloons.
- Maria had 1 water balloon for herself.

Next, her mom gave each person 3 more balloons:

- Since there are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons given is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) balloons.

Now, let's add up all the balloons:

- Initial balloons given to friends: 8
- Balloons Maria had: 1
- Additional balloons given by her mom: 15

Total number of balloons = \(8 + 1 + 15 = 24\).

So, the total number of balloons the girls had is 24."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated and already owned by the charity group.

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so the total number of donated boxes is:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

Adding the 10 boxes they already have:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all 60 boxes, given that each table can hold 2 boxes.

The total number of tables needed is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes per table}} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

Since they already own 15 tables, the number of new tables they need is:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ tables} \]

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, calculate the total distance spat by Zoey:
- Zoey has 40 seeds and each seed is spat 10 feet.
- Total distance spat by Zoey = \(40 \times 10 = 400\) feet.

Next, calculate the total distance spat by Sydney:
- Sydney has 35 seeds and each seed is spat 12 feet.
- Total distance spat by Sydney = \(35 \times 12 = 420\) feet.

Now, find the combined total distance spat by both:
- Combined total distance = \(400 + 420 = 820\) feet.

To find the average total distance spat, divide the combined total distance by the number of participants (2):
- Average total distance = \(\frac{820}{2} = 410\) feet.

**Final numerical answer:**
410 feet"
"First, let's calculate the hourly production for each widget-making machine:

- **Widgeteer 3000**: 60 widgets per hour
- **WidgetMaster 9000**: 45 widgets per hour

Next, we calculate the daily production for each machine:

- **Widgeteer 3000**: \(60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1440 \text{ widgets/day}\)
- **WidgetMaster 9000**: \(45 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1080 \text{ widgets/day}\)

Now, we calculate the monthly production for each machine, assuming 30 days in a month:

- **Widgeteer 3000**: \(1440 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 43200 \text{ widgets/month}\)
- **WidgetMaster 9000**: \(1080 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 32400 \text{ widgets/month}\)

Next, we calculate the monthly earnings from selling the widgets:

- **Widgeteer 3000**: \(43200 \text{ widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$259200\)
- **WidgetMaster 9000**: \(32400 \text{ widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$194400\)

Finally, we find the difference in earnings between the two machines:

\[ \$259200 - \$194400 = \$64800 \]

So, Fern will make **\$64,800 more** from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000 over a month."
"First, let's calculate the total hours Cameron will stay at the hotel. He arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.

Next, we need to determine the cost for the first 12 hours and the additional cost for the remaining 5 hours.

- The cost for the first 12 hours is 1000 pesos.
- The cost for each additional hour after the 12-hour mark is 70 pesos. Since Cameron stays for 5 additional hours, the cost for these hours is \(5 \times 70 = 350\) pesos.

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay, using the option of adding on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark, is:
\[1000 + 350 = 1350 \text{ pesos}\]

Now, let's calculate the cost if Cameron had paid for a 24-hour stay:
- The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of his actual stay from the cost of a 24-hour stay:
\[1600 - 1350 = 250 \text{ pesos}\]

Therefore, Cameron would save 250 pesos."
"First, let's determine how much hay each sheep needs. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, we calculate the hay needed for each sheep as follows:

\[ 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we calculate the total hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:

\[ 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay."
"First, calculate John's total earnings for the week:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, subtract the amount spent on gas:
\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, subtract the amount he wants to deposit in the bank:
\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, calculate the total cost of the 5 pencils:
\[ 5 \text{ pencils} \times 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, determine how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with the remaining money:

"First, let's calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled out. Craig has spelled out 20 words, each with 15 letters. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig has spelled is:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Next, we know that Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled is:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the number of letters Craig has spelled to the number of letters his brother has spelled:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

\[ 650 \]"

Therefore, the total number of children in the drill is:
\[ 280 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming all her coupons. Since each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice and she has 9 coupons, the total number of bottles is:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the teacher has \(\boxed{842}\) bottles of apple juice for herself."
"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing job, we need to consider the following components:

1. **Visit Charge**: $40
2. **Labor Charge**: $35 per hour, or part thereof, for 2.25 hours. Since the charge is per hour or part thereof, we round up 2.25 hours to 3 hours (as partial hours are charged as full hours). Therefore, the labor charge is $35 * 3 = $105.
3. **Parts Charge**: $60

Now, we sum these charges:

\[
\text{Total Charge} = \text{Visit Charge} + \text{Labor Charge} + \text{Parts Charge}
\]

\[
\text{Total Charge} = 40 + 105 + 60 = 205
\]

Therefore, the total charge for the job is **$205**."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount:

\[ 10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.40 \times \$150 = \$60 \]

So, the discounted price for the 10 CDs is:

\[ \$150 - \$60 = \$90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each:

\[ 5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40 \text{ per CD} = \$200 \]

Now, we need to determine how much James was out of pocket. He spent $90 on the CDs and received $200 from selling 5 of them. The net amount he spent is:

\[ \$90 - \$200 = -\$110 \]

Since the result is negative, it means James actually gained $110. However, the question asks how much money he was ""out,"" which in this context means the amount he spent minus the amount he received from selling the CDs. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{\$110} \]"
"To find out how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of root crop and then sum them up.

   - Price per yam: $1.5
   - Total earnings from yams: \( 6 \times 1.5 = 9 \)

2. **Sweet Potatoes:**
   - Number of sweet potatoes: 10
   - Price per sweet potato: $2
   - Total earnings from sweet potatoes: \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \)

3. **Carrots:**
   - Number of carrots: 4
   - Price per carrot: $1.25
   - Total earnings from carrots: \( 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \)

"First, let's calculate the distance James swims before resting. He swims 60% of the 20-mile lake:

\[ 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes to swim this distance. Since he swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour:

\[ \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

After swimming, he rests for half as long as the swimming time:

\[ \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, he swims the remaining distance. The remaining distance is:

\[ 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

He swims the remaining distance at half his original speed, which is 1 mile per hour:

\[ \text{Time to swim 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we add up all the times to find the total time to get across the lake:

\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:

\[ \boxed{17 \text{ hours}} \]"
"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many loaves Sam had last Friday.
2. Calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had.
3. Subtract 40 from the result to find out how many loaves the bakery has.

Given that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday, we can proceed as follows:

1. Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is \(7 \times 70 = 490\).
2. The bakery has 40 less than this amount, so we subtract 40 from 490: \(490 - 40 = 450\).

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread."

"First, let's calculate the commission Cayley earns from the New York Times sales:

- Each New York Times costs $5.
- He gets a 10% commission on each copy.
- Therefore, the commission per copy of the New York Times is \(5 \times 0.10 = 0.50\) dollars.

Cayley sells 6 copies of the New York Times, so the total commission from the New York Times is:
\[6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \text{ dollars}\]

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal sales:

- Each Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- He gets an 8% commission on each copy.
- Therefore, the commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is \(15 \times 0.08 = 1.20\) dollars.

Cayley sells 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal, so the total commission from the Wall Street Journal is:
\[10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \text{ dollars}\]

Finally, the total commission Cayley earns from both newspapers is:
\[3.00 + 12.00 = 15.00 \text{ dollars}\]

**Final Answer: 15.00**"
"Given that Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can determine Marcus's age first.

\[ \text{Marcus's age} = 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Since Marcus is half of Leo’s age, we can set up the equation for Leo's age as follows:

\[ \text{Marcus's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Leo's age} \]

Substituting Marcus's age:

\[ 21 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Leo's age} \]

To find Leo's age, we solve for Leo's age:

\[ \text{Leo's age} = 21 \times 2 = 42 \]

So, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's define the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can translate these statements into the following equations:
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Now, substitute these expressions into the first equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]
\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3B = 75 \]
\[ B = 25 \]

Now that we have \( B = 25 \), we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored \( 5 \) points.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the number of pages in the book, we need to use the information given about the thickness of the book and the number of pages per inch.

1. The book is 1.5 inches thick.
2. There are 100 pages per inch of thickness.

To find the total number of pages, we multiply the thickness of the book by the number of pages per inch:

\[ 1.5 \text{ inches} \times 100 \text{ pages/inch} = 150 \text{ pages} \]

Therefore, the book has 150 pages."
"First, let's determine the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and ended at 11:00 PM.

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we need to convert this time into minutes because Vince's rate is given in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes, we divide:

\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:

\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Calculate the usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - Convert 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Determine the actual wake-up time:**
   - Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m., but this day she woke up 5 minutes earlier.
   - So, she woke up at 5:55 a.m.

3. **Calculate the time Kim was asleep before she started sleepwalking:**
   - From 10 p.m. to 2:15 a.m. is 4 hours and 15 minutes.
   - Convert 4 hours and 15 minutes to minutes: \(4 \times 60 + 15 = 255\) minutes.

4. **Calculate the time Kim was sleepwalking:**
   - From 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. is 23 minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time Kim was asleep:**
   - Total time asleep = Time before sleepwalking + Time after sleepwalking.
   - Total time asleep = 255 minutes (before sleepwalking) + (480 minutes - 255 minutes - 23 minutes) (after sleepwalking).
   - Total time asleep = 255 + (480 - 255 - 23) = 255 + 202 = 457 minutes.

6. **Calculate the time Kim was on her bed but not asleep:**
   - Time on bed but not asleep = Time sleepwalking + Time before sleepwalking.
   - Time on bed but not asleep = 23 minutes (sleepwalking) + 255 minutes (before sleepwalking) = 278 minutes.

7. **Calculate the time Kim was on her bed and asleep:**
   - Time on bed and asleep = Total time on bed - Time on bed but not asleep.
   - Time on bed and asleep = 480 minutes (total time on bed) - 278 minutes (time on bed but not asleep) = 202 minutes.

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 202 minutes that day."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring cups Jonathan has. Since he has two dozen cups, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Next, we know that Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining by adding the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

\[ 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \text{ utensils} \]

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ 34 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of beds currently occupied in the hospital:

1/5 of 1000 beds are occupied, so:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \text{ beds occupied} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, over 14 days (2 weeks):
\[ 50 \times 14 = 700 \text{ patients admitted} \]

Now, we add the number of patients admitted to the number of beds already occupied to find the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks:
\[ 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ beds occupied} \]

Finally, to find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity of the hospital:
\[ 1000 - 900 = 100 \text{ unoccupied beds} \]

**Final numerical answer:**
100"
"First, let's determine the number of emails that are not work emails. Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day, and 7 of these are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 9 non-work emails are sent to family. Two-thirds of the 9 emails are to family:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

This means 6 emails are sent to family. The remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. To find out how many emails are left for her boyfriend, we subtract the number of family emails from the non-work emails:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

One-third of these remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. Since the remaining emails are 3, and we need to find one-third of these:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

Final answer:
\[ 1 \]"
"First, we determine Shawna's age. Since Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we calculate Shawna's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we calculate the age of Shawna's father, who is five times as old as Shawna:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to reverse the 20% overstatement that Kelly claims Courtney made.

1. Let the actual number of people be \( x \).
2. Courtney reported 48, which is 120% of the actual number (since she overestimated by 20%).

We can set up the equation:
\[ 1.20x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"To solve this problem, let's define the number of balls each boy carried in terms of Jeffrey's number of balls.

Let \( J \) represent the number of balls Jeffrey carried. According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by all three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each boy:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \]

Now, substituting \( J = 1 \) back into the expression for the total number of balls:
\[ 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes by the end of the third day after filling in two holes.
3. Use the information that the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.**

- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes

Total holes dug by the end of the third day:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of holes by the end of the third day after filling in two holes.**

After filling in two holes:
\[ 31 - 2 = 29 \]

**Step 3: Use the information that the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day.**

Number of holes at the end of the first day:
\[ 10 \]

Number of holes by the end of the fourth day:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day.**

Number of holes dug on the fourth day:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \]

Therefore, the pirates dug \(\boxed{11}\) holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure."
"Let's denote the number of corn chips that Collins received as \( C \). According to the problem, Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, and Collins received 15 more than either of them. Therefore, Collins received \( 70 + 15 = 85 \) corn chips.

The total number of corn chips can be calculated by summing the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ 70 + 70 + 85 = 225 \]

"First, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets for travel. The tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The supplies cost $400 in total.

To find 50% of $400:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the cost of the tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost of travel is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Let's define the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X + S + A = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, we substitute the expression for \( X \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (S + 5) + S + A = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A = 334 \]

Next, we substitute the expression for \( S \) from the third equation into the equation \( 2S + A = 334 \):
\[ 2(4A - 13) + A = 334 \]
\[ 8A - 26 + A = 334 \]
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we have \( A = 40 \), we can find \( S \) using the third equation:
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught \(\boxed{147}\) Pokemon."

"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southward direction and subtract the total distance traveled in the northward direction.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: North
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Next, we calculate the net southward distance by subtracting the northward distance from the total southward distance:

- Total southward distance: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \)
- Total northward distance: \( 36 \text{ miles} \)

Net southward distance: \( 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \)

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \(\boxed{374}\) miles."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies. Since 1 dozen equals 12 brownies, she made 12 brownies.
2. At her office party, she received 1/2 a dozen brownies. This is equivalent to 6 brownies (since 1/2 of 12 is 6).
3. When she arrived home, there were 4 dozen brownies waiting for her. This is 48 brownies (since 4 times 12 is 48).
4. During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. This is equivalent to 18 brownies (since 1 1/2 is the same as 1.5, and 1.5 times 12 is 18).

Now, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had initially and then subtract the number of brownies eaten and received.

- Initial brownies: 12 (made by Greta) + 6 (from office party) + 48 (from surprise party) = 66 brownies.
- Brownies eaten during the surprise party: 18 brownies.

So, the number of brownies left over is:
66 (initial total) - 18 (eaten) = 48 brownies.

Therefore, Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day."
"First, let's determine the age of Nani's brother. Since Nani is 8 years old and his brother is twice his age, the brother's age is:
\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find the age of Nani's sister. She is 25% younger than Nani. To find 25% of Nani's age, we calculate:
\[ 8 \times 0.25 = 2 \text{ years} \]
So, the sister is:
\[ 8 - 2 = 6 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we add the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister to find the total age:
\[ 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \]

The total age of all three family members is:

"To determine the total time it will take Andy to restring all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of stringing and then sum these times.

1. **Synthetic Gut Racquets:**
   - Number of racquets: 3
   - Time per racquet: 15 minutes
   - Total time: \(3 \times 15 = 45\) minutes

2. **Polyester String Racquets:**
   - Number of racquets: 5
   - Time per racquet: 22 minutes
   - Total time: \(5 \times 22 = 110\) minutes

3. **Hybrid Sets:**
   - Number of racquets: 4
   - Time per racquet: 18 minutes
   - Total time: \(4 \times 18 = 72\) minutes

"First, we determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we add 7 to 13 to find the number of players on Zeke's team:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Next, we find the total number of players in both teams combined by adding the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

\[ 20 + 13 = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is:

\[ 33 \]"
"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington gave away. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals:

\[2 + 2 = 4 \text{ boxes}\]

Next, we subtract the boxes given away from the total number of boxes she bought:

\[12 - 4 = 8 \text{ boxes}\]

These 8 boxes are the ones she kept and then sold a portion of. She kept 1/4 of the oranges, so the remaining 3/4 were sold. First, we calculate the total number of oranges in the 8 boxes she kept:

\[8 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges/box} = 160 \text{ oranges}\]

Since she kept 1/4 of these oranges, the number of oranges she kept is:

\[\frac{1}{4} \times 160 = 40 \text{ oranges}\]

Therefore, the number of oranges she sold is the total number of oranges she kept minus the number of oranges she kept:

\[160 - 40 = 120 \text{ oranges}\]

So, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is:

\[120\]"
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of states in India} = \frac{x}{2} + 4 \]

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \]

Simplifying the expression:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \). Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy.

The cost of the dictionary is $18.
The cost of the dinosaur book is $13.
The cost of the children's cookbook is $8.

Adding these together:
\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

So, the total cost of the books is $39.

Next, we need to determine how much more money Tyler needs to buy the books. He has already saved $14.

The additional amount needed is:
\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide the amount needed by his hourly wage:
\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford the books.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's determine how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard and Robert has 30 cherries, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Robert's cherries} = \text{Richard's cherries} + 10 \]

Substituting the number of cherries Robert has:

\[ 30 = \text{Richard's cherries} + 10 \]

Solving for Richard's cherries:

\[ \text{Richard's cherries} = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Now, we know the total number of cherries is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the cherries that Richard and Robert have from the total:

\[ \text{Jerry's cherries} = 60 - (\text{Richard's cherries} + \text{Robert's cherries}) \]
\[ \text{Jerry's cherries} = 60 - (20 + 30) \]
\[ \text{Jerry's cherries} = 60 - 50 = 10 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Robert's cherries} - \text{Jerry's cherries} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( G_S \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday.
- Let \( A_S \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday.
- Let \( G_U \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday.
- Let \( A_U \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday.
2. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday and 15 boxes of apple pie.

We can translate this into equations:
1. \( G_S = 10 \)
2. \( A_S = A_U - 4 \)
3. \( G_U = G_S + 5 \)
4. \( A_U = 15 \)

Now, substitute the known values into the equations:
- From \( G_S = 10 \), we know \( G_S = 10 \).
- From \( A_U = 15 \), we know \( A_U = 15 \).
- From \( G_U = G_S + 5 \), we get \( G_U = 10 + 5 = 15 \).
- From \( A_S = A_U - 4 \), we get \( A_S = 15 - 4 = 11 \).

Now, we can calculate the earnings for each day:
- Earnings from gingerbread on Saturday: \( 10 \times 6 = 60 \) dollars.
- Earnings from apple pie on Saturday: \( 11 \times 15 = 165 \) dollars.
- Earnings from gingerbread on Sunday: \( 15 \times 6 = 90 \) dollars.
- Earnings from apple pie on Sunday: \( 15 \times 15 = 225 \) dollars.

Adding these together gives the total earnings for the two days:
\[ 60 + 165 + 90 + 225 = 540 \]

So, the total amount Sunny earned for the two days is:
\[ \boxed{540} \]"
"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of sunscreen used per day:**
   - Pamela reapplies 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour.
   - She will be outside for 4 hours a day.
   - Therefore, the amount of sunscreen used per day is \( 1 \, \text{ounce/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{ounces} \).

2. **Calculate the total amount of sunscreen used over 8 days:**
   - She will be outside for 8 days.
   - The total amount of sunscreen used over 8 days is \( 4 \, \text{ounces/day} \times 8 \, \text{days} = 32 \, \text{ounces} \).

3. **Determine the number of bottles needed:**
   - Each bottle contains 8 ounces of sunscreen.
   - The number of bottles needed is \( \frac{32 \, \text{ounces}}{8 \, \text{ounces/bottle}} = 4 \, \text{bottles} \).

"First, let's calculate the price of the red car. Since the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, we need to find 40% of the blue car's price and subtract it from the blue car's price.

The price of the blue car is $100. 

40% of $100 is calculated as:
\[ 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \]

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. Therefore, the price of the red car is:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the blue car and the price of the red car:
\[ 100 + 60 = 160 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 160 \]"
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( D \) be the current age of Emil's dad.
- Let \( B \) be the current age of Emil's brother.

Emil is currently 19 years old. When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years older than he is now. At that time:
- Emil's age will be 24.
- His dad's age will be \( D + 5 \).
- His brother's age will be \( B + 5 \).

According to the problem, when Emil is 24:
1. Emil will be half the age of his dad.
2. Emil will be twice as old as his brother.

From the first condition:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]
Multiplying both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
Subtracting 5 from both sides:
\[ D = 43 \]

From the second condition:
\[ 24 = 2 (B + 5) \]
Dividing both sides by 2:
\[ 12 = B + 5 \]
Subtracting 5 from both sides:
\[ B = 7 \]

Now, we need to find the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother:
\[ D + B = 43 + 7 = 50 \]

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is:

"Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.

Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, which means her sister gave her \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.

Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which means her friend gave her \(20 \times 2 = 40\) beads.

To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we add the beads from her mother, sister, and friend:

\[20 + 30 + 40 = 90\]

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"First, let's calculate the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we sum the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[ 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we divide the total pounds by 3 to find the number of servings:
\[ \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

Therefore, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish."
"First, let's calculate the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 6 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after accounting for the football players:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ students} \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We calculate this as follows:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = \frac{25}{100} \times 24 = 6 \text{ students} \]

Now, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, we determine the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's and Sophie wears size five boots, we calculate Charlie's boot size as follows:

\[ \text{Charlie's boot size} = 5 \times \text{Sophie's boot size} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Next, we find the average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie. The average is calculated by adding the sizes together and then dividing by the number of people (which is 2 in this case):

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Charlie's boot size} + \text{Sophie's boot size}}{2} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Therefore, the average size of shoe worn by the two is:

\[ 15 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many additional plants Pat needs to buy and then calculate the total cost.

1. **Convert the width of the plants to feet:**
   - Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is \( \frac{12}{12} = 1 \) foot wide.

2. **Determine the total space required for each plant including the space between them:**
   - Each plant needs 1 foot for itself and 1.5 feet for the space between plants, so the total space per plant is \( 1 + 1.5 = 2.5 \) feet.

3. **Calculate the number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long. The number of plants that can fit is \( \frac{111}{2.5} = 44.4 \).
   - Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

4. **Determine how many additional plants Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 plants, so the number of additional plants needed is \( 44 - 17 = 27 \).

5. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for 27 plants is \( 27 \times 6 = 162 \).

**Final Answer:**
Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar. Since Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, his brother eats:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ pretzels a day} \]

To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"First, let's calculate the cost for one hanging basket:

- For petunias: \(3 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00 = \$9.00\)
- For sweet potato vines: \(2 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50 = \$5.00\)

So, the total cost for one basket is:
\[ \$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00 \]

Since Katherine has 5 hanging baskets, the total cost for all baskets is:
\[ 5 \times \$14.00 = \$70.00 \]

Therefore, Katherine will spend \(\$70.00\) filling all 5 hanging baskets."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they are planting 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they are planting 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil. Subtract the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. With the remaining 3 pounds of soil, they can plant:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

Therefore, they can plant 3 roses."
"First, we need to calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times 2000 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with the $500.00 she sets aside each month. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

\[ \text{Number of shoes per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \text{ pairs} \]

Since she can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0.5 pairs per month, which means she can buy 1 pair every 2 months.

Now, we need to find out how many pairs she can buy in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

\[ \text{Number of pairs per year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months per pair}} = 6 \text{ pairs} \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time required for Emily to both peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp:
- Emily peels 6 shrimp per minute.
- To peel 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{6} = 15 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to sauté 90 shrimp:
- Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- To sauté 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{30} \times 10 = 3 \times 10 = 30 \) minutes.

Since these tasks can be done sequentially, we add the time for peeling and sautering:
- Total time = 15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (sautéing) = 45 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

45 minutes"
"Let's break down the temperature changes step by step:

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 3 hours, the temperature change is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) degrees.

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - After 4 hours, the temperature change is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) degrees.

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 2 hours, the temperature change is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's sum up the total temperature change:
- Cooling effect: \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.
- Warming effect: \(4\) degrees.

The net temperature change is:
\[ 18 - 4 = 14 \text{ degrees} \]

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

**Final answer:**
14 degrees."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley:**
   - Let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw Comet Halley as \( D \).

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw Comet Halley for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. So, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \( 3D \).

3. **Calculate the time interval between the two sightings:**
   - Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time interval between the two sightings is 75 years.

4. **Set up the equation for Bill's age at the second sighting:**
   - If Bill was \( 3D \) years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and the time interval between the two sightings is 75 years, then Bill's age at the first sighting would be \( 3D - 75 \).

5. **Determine the value of \( D \):**
   - We need to find \( D \) such that \( 3D - 75 \) is a positive integer and makes sense in the context of the problem.

6. **Solve for \( D \):**
   - Since Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, \( D = 30 \).

7. **Calculate Bill's age at the first sighting:**
   - Bill's age at the first sighting is \( 3D - 75 = 3 \times 30 - 75 = 90 - 75 = 15 \).

Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the frequency of each type of check and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

2. **Gas bill**: Similarly, he writes one check per month for the gas bill, which also results in:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

3. **Church**: He writes two checks per month to the church. Over a year, this amounts to:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ checks}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service**: He writes one check every quarter (3 months) to the pest and lawn service. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes:
   \[
   4 \text{ checks}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52 \text{ checks}
\]

Therefore, Buford writes a total of:
\[
52 \text{ checks per year}
\]"
"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in one day as \( F \).

According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \).

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Thus, the number of flights to France and the number of flights to Germany are each \( \frac{1}{4}F \).

The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips. It is given that these 44 trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 44 = \frac{1}{2}F \]

Solving for \( F \):
\[ F = 44 \times 2 = 88 \]

Now, we know the first plane makes 88 flights in one day. The number of flights to France is:
\[ \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is \( 22 \)."
"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl:

- Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
- Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds.
- Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, which is \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Next, we add up the total duration of their howls:

\[ 20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the total duration from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):

\[ \frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"First, let's determine how much money Adam received from his father. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, and his mother gave him $6, his father gave him:

\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the money given by his mother and father to find the total amount of money Adam received from them:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Adam's trousers cost $30. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount of money he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Adam had to contribute \(\boxed{12}\) dollars from his savings."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. \(A = 3\)
2. \(B = 4\)
3. The total age of the children is 20, so \(A + B + H + W = 20\).
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, so \(H = 2 \times \frac{A + B + H + W}{4}\).

First, substitute the known values of \(A\) and \(B\) into the total age equation:
\[3 + 4 + H + W = 20\]
\[7 + H + W = 20\]
\[H + W = 13\]

Next, substitute the known values of \(A\), \(B\), and the total age into the equation for Helene's age:
\[H = 2 \times \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times \frac{7 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = \frac{2(7 + H + W)}{4}\]
\[H = \frac{14 + 2H + 2W}{4}\]
\[4H = 14 + 2H + 2W\]
\[2H = 14 + 2W\]
\[H = 7 + W\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(H + W = 13\)
2. \(H = 7 + W\)

Substitute the second equation into the first:
\[7 + W + W = 13\]
\[7 + 2W = 13\]
\[2W = 6\]
\[W = 3\]

So, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the total amount of money collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund. This is done by adding the two amounts together:

\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute. According to the problem, the lawyer will donate three times the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. So, we multiply the total amount by 3:

\[ 2000 \times 3 = 6000 \]

Therefore, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute:

\[ \boxed{6000} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

Next, the bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. So, we need to find half of 1500:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

This means 750 cookies were given to the church next door. If each person in the church next door received 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's first define the size of the slices each adult and each kid gets in terms of a variable. Let's say each kid gets a slice of size \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult gets a slice of size \( 2x \).

The total number of slices is 6 (2 adults and 4 kids). Therefore, the total size of the watermelon can be expressed as the sum of the sizes of all the slices:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x. \]

This means the total watermelon is equivalent to \( 8x \). Each adult gets a slice of size \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of each adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100. \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\%. \]

Therefore, each adult gets \( 25\% \) of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on his inpatient rounds. Since he has 9 inpatients and it takes him 20 minutes per inpatient, the total time spent on rounds is:

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes/inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the total time spent on his appointments. He has 10 appointments, each taking 30 minutes:

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes/appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 480 minutes into hours:

\[ 480 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic. Subtracting the time spent on rounds and appointments from the total time available:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to work backwards from the 5:00 pm serving time, accounting for all the time required for each step of the process.

1. **Frosting the cake**: 10 minutes
2. **Cooling the cake**: 2 hours (120 minutes)
3. **Baking the cake**: 30 minutes
4. **Making the cake batter**: 20 minutes

Let's add up the total time required for all these steps:
\[ 10 \text{ minutes (frosting)} + 120 \text{ minutes (cooling)} + 30 \text{ minutes (baking)} + 20 \text{ minutes (making batter)} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours. Therefore, Jordan needs to start 3 hours before 5:00 pm.

\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

So, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is **2:00 pm**."
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as \( x \).

Lisa sold \( 3.5 \) boxes, which is \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold \( 4.5 \) boxes, which is \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold \( 64 \) chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:
\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by \( 8 \):
\[ x = \frac{64}{8} = 8 \]

So, the number of chocolate bars in a box is \( 8 \).

**Final Answer:**
8"
"First, let's calculate the cost per session for the dance studio. The cost includes a fixed studio rental fee plus a variable cost based on the number of students.

The fixed cost per session is $25, and the variable cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the variable cost per session is:
\[ 10 \text{ students} \times \$1.50 \text{ per student} = \$15 \]

So, the total cost per session is:
\[ \$25 + \$15 = \$40 \]

The dance studio is rented 3 days a week. Therefore, the weekly cost is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times \$40 \text{ per day} = \$120 \]

Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the monthly cost is:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times \$120 \text{ per week} = \$480 \]

Thus, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are:
\[ \$480 \]"
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( p \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( m \).

From the problem, we know:
- Peter has 4 boxes, and the total number of chocolate bars he has is 64. This gives us the equation:
  \[
  4p = 64
  \]
- Martha has 7 boxes, and the total number of chocolate bars she has is 56. This gives us the equation:
  \[
  7m = 56
  \]

First, we solve for \( p \) and \( m \):
\[
p = \frac{64}{4} = 16
\]
\[
m = \frac{56}{7} = 8
\]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:
\[
p - m = 16 - 8 = 8
\]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
"First, let's determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the total population of porcupines is 50 and the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

Next, we need to calculate the number of porcupine babies born each month. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, so the total number of babies born each month is:

\[
\text{Number of babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[
\text{Number of babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
\]

The initial population of porcupines is 50, and after a year, the population will increase by the number of babies born in that year. Therefore, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year is:

\[
\text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1490}
\]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the swimming pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \]

\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to convert cubic feet to gallons:

\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars/gallon} \]

\[ \text{Total cost} = 826 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"To find the total number of sticks, we need to determine the number of each type of stick and then sum them up.

1. **Red Sticks**: There are 9 red sticks.
2. **Blue Sticks**: There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. So, the number of blue sticks is:
   \[
   9 + 5 = 14
   \]
3. **Yellow Sticks**: The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. So, the number of yellow sticks is:
   \[
   14 - 3 = 11
   \]

Now, we sum up all the sticks:
\[
9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34

"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

The distance traveled can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

For Shandy:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance traveled by Matteo from the distance traveled by Shandy:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"First, let's determine the number of students over 16 years old and the number of students under 16 years old.

Since half of the 3000 students are over 16 years old:
\[ \text{Students over 16} = \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \]

The remaining half are under 16 years old:
\[ \text{Students under 16} = \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \]

Next, we calculate the number of male students over 16 years old. One-fourth of the students over 16 are male:
\[ \text{Male students over 16} = \frac{1500}{4} = 375 \]

Therefore, the number of female students over 16 years old is:
\[ \text{Female students over 16} = 1500 - 375 = 1125 \]

Now, we calculate the number of male students under 16 years old. One-half of the students under 16 are male:
\[ \text{Male students under 16} = \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

Therefore, the number of female students under 16 years old is:
\[ \text{Female students under 16} = 1500 - 750 = 750 \]

Finally, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16 to get the total number of female students:
\[ \text{Total female students} = 1125 + 750 = 1875 \]

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is:

"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run in one hour.

1. Bethany can run 10 laps.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps. The difference is \(10 - 5 = 5\) laps.

Therefore, Bethany can run \(\boxed{5}\) more laps compared to Quinn."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
     \[
     \text{Wanda's first day contribution} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
     \[
     \text{Ms. B's first day contribution} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   \[
   \text{Total first day contribution} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount of water pumped on the second day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Wanda's second day contribution} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Ms. B's second day contribution} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the second day:**
   \[
   \text{Total second day contribution} = 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped over the two days:**
   \[
   \text{Total water pumped} = 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

6. **Calculate the remaining capacity of the tank:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining capacity} = 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons}

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final charge percentage to the initial charge percentage when Maria left for the park.

1. **Final Charge Calculation:**
   - After 8 hours, the power bank was at 28% charge.

2. **Charge Loss in the Last 3 Hours:**
   - For the last 3 hours, the power bank lost 7% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge percentage at the start of these 3 hours.
   - The charge after 3 hours would be \( x - 3 \times 7\% = x - 21\% \).
   - Given that this equals 28%, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     x - 21\% = 28\%
     \]
     \[
     x = 28\% + 21\% = 49\%
     \]

3. **Charge Loss in the First 5 Hours:**
   - For the first 5 hours, the power bank lost 9% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge percentage at the start of these 5 hours.
   - The charge after 5 hours would be \( y - 5 \times 9\% = y - 45\% \).
   - Given that this equals 49%, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     y - 45\% = 49\%
     \]
     \[
     y = 49\% + 45\% = 94\%
     \]

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was **94%**."
"First, let's calculate Janet's total hourly earnings from both wages and tips:

\[ \text{Total hourly earnings} = \$10 + \$15 = \$25 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Janet wants to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of $10,000:

\[ \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times \$10,000 = \$2,000 \]

Now, we calculate how much Janet earns in a week by working 40 hours:

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 40 \text{ hours} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$1,000 \]

To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\$2,000}{\$1,000/\text{week}} = 2 \]

Therefore, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jamaar has already purchased.

- Cost of 3 peaches: \(3 \times 0.5 = 1.5\) dollars
- Cost of 4 pears: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2.0\) dollars
- Cost of 2 kiwis: \(2 \times 1 = 2.0\) dollars
- Cost of 5 apples: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\) dollars

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total spent so far:
\[1.5 + 2.0 + 2.0 + 3.75 = 9.25\] dollars

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount is:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\] dollars

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums."
"First, we calculate the total number of sweets Anne has:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack contains 60 pieces, so the total number of pieces she gave to her friends is:

\[ 13 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne has 10 friends, and she distributed the sweets equally among them. Therefore, the number of pieces each friend received is:

\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which in this context is the compound price increase:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the final price after \( n \) years.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price.
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (expressed as a decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% as a decimal)
- \( n = 3 \) years

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Now, multiply by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be $139."
"First, we need to determine how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she evenly distributed 72 pictures into 8 albums, we divide 72 by 8:

\[ 72 \div 8 = 9 \]

So, each album contains 9 pictures.

Next, we know that 3 albums were selfies only and 2 albums were portraits only. This means there are:

- 3 albums of selfies, so \(3 \times 9 = 27\) selfies.
- 2 albums of portraits, so \(2 \times 9 = 18\) portraits.

Adding the number of selfies and portraits together gives us the total number of selfies and portraits:

\[ 27 + 18 = 45 \]

So, the total number of selfies and portraits is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"First, we need to determine how long it takes James to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can find the time per page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} \]

Next, we calculate the total time it takes for James to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time per page by 18 pages:

\[ \text{Total time} = \left( \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} \right) \times 18 \text{ pages} \]

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{10 \times 18}{3} \text{ minutes} \]

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{180}{3} \text{ minutes} \]

\[ \text{Total time} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading."
"Initially, the hotel had 100 guests.

- 24 guests elected for an early checkout, so the number of guests decreased by 24.
- 15 guests elected for a late checkout, so the number of guests decreased by 15.
- In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice that number is \(2 \times 15 = 30\) guests who checked in.
- After dinner, 7 more people checked in.

Let's calculate the number of guests step by step:

1. Initial number of guests: 100
2. Guests after early checkout: \(100 - 24 = 76\)
3. Guests after late checkout: \(76 - 15 = 61\)
4. Guests after afternoon check-in: \(61 + 30 = 91\)
5. Guests after dinner check-in: \(91 + 7 = 98\)

The final number of guests in the hotel is 98."
"On Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas.
On Thursday, he picks 6 bananas.
On Friday, he picks triple the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday, which is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) bananas.

To find the total number of bananas John has, we add the bananas picked each day:
\[4 + 6 + 12 = 22\]

John has 22 bananas in total."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions:**
   - Total number of questions = 60
   - Percentage of easy questions = 40%
   - Number of easy questions = \( 60 \times 0.40 = 24 \)
   - The remaining questions are average and difficult.
   - Number of average and difficult questions = \( 60 - 24 = 36 \)
   - Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided, the number of average questions = number of difficult questions = \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \)

2. **Calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct.
   - Number of easy questions Aries is sure to get correct = \( 24 \times 0.75 = 18 \)
   - Aries is sure to get half of the average questions correct.
   - Number of average questions Aries is sure to get correct = \( 18 \times 0.50 = 9 \)
   - Aries is sure to get half of the difficult questions correct.
   - Number of difficult questions Aries is sure to get correct = \( 18 \times 0.50 = 9 \)

3. **Calculate the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Total correct answers = Number of easy questions correct + Number of average questions correct + Number of difficult questions correct
   - Total correct answers = \( 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 \)

Therefore, Aries is sure to get \(\boxed{36}\) points."
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( S \) be the number of small stuffed animals sold.
- Let \( L \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold.
- The price of a small stuffed animal is $4.
- The price of a large stuffed animal is \( 3 \times 4 = $12 \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so \( S = 2L \).
2. The total earnings from the sales were $120.

The total earnings can be expressed as:
\[ 4S + 12L = 120 \]

Substituting \( S = 2L \) into the equation:
\[ 4(2L) + 12L = 120 \]
\[ 8L + 12L = 120 \]
\[ 20L = 120 \]
\[ L = 6 \]

Since \( S = 2L \):
\[ S = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

So, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

**Final Answer:**

"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first need to calculate the daily consumption and then multiply it by 7 (the number of days in a week).

1. The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
2. The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
3. The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

First, we calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one day:
\[ 5 \text{ (man)} + 4 \text{ (wife)} + 2 \text{ (son)} = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten in one week (7 days):
\[ 11 \text{ sandwiches/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 77 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Therefore, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."

"First, let's determine the amount of ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day.

1. **Iron Pickaxe:**
   - One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.

2. **Steel Pickaxe:**
   - With a steel pickaxe, a dwarf can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe.
   - 50% of 12 pounds is \( 12 \times 0.5 = 6 \) pounds.
   - Therefore, with a steel pickaxe, a dwarf can mine \( 12 + 6 = 18 \) pounds of ore per day.

Next, we calculate the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves can mine with steel pickaxes in one day:

- 40 dwarves mining 18 pounds each per day:
  \[
  40 \times 18 = 720 \text{ pounds per day}
  \]

Finally, we calculate the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days:

- 720 pounds per day for 30 days:
  \[
  720 \times 30 = 21600 \text{ pounds}

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we first need to find the unit price for each package size.

1. **First Package:**
   - 2 sandwiches for $3.
   - Unit price = \(\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\) dollars per sandwich.

2. **Second Package:**
   - 4 sandwiches for $6.
   - Unit price = \(\frac{6}{4} = 1.5\) dollars per sandwich.

Since the unit price is consistent across the first two packages, we can assume the same unit price applies to the third package.

3. **Third Package:**
   - 8 sandwiches.
   - Cost = 8 sandwiches \(\times\) 1.5 dollars per sandwich = 12 dollars.

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."
"First, we need to determine the net amount Tom needs to pay for the bedroom set after selling his old one. 

The cost of the new bedroom set is $3000, and he sells his old one for $1000. So, the net amount he needs to pay is:
\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% of this net amount each month. To find out how much he needs to pay per month, we calculate 10% of $2000:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month.

"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. Sally started with 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst due to the wind. 

\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]

So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving her with:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of her 12 yellow balloons:

\[ 12 \times 0.50 = 6 \]

So, she lost 6 yellow balloons, leaving her with:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

As Sally neared the school, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons. First, calculate 75% of the 8 blue balloons:

\[ 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - If a substitute teacher is present, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
   - Probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework given a substitute teacher: 0%

2. **Normal Teacher with Extension Scenario:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher being present: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.40
   - Probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework given the normal teacher gives an extension: 0%

3. **Normal Teacher without Extension Scenario:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher being present: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.60
   - Probability that Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment: 20% or 0.20
   - Probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework given the normal teacher does not give an extension but Marcus does not get a personal extension: 100% or 1.00

Now, we calculate the overall probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework by considering the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension:

- Probability of having a substitute teacher and not having to turn in homework: \(0.50 \times 0 = 0\)
- Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension and not having to turn in homework: \(0.50 \times 0.40 \times 0 = 0\)
- Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus not getting a personal extension and having to turn in homework: \(0.50 \times 0.60 \times 0.80 = 0.24\)

Adding these probabilities together gives the total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

\[0 + 0 + 0.24 = 0.24\]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[0.24 \times 100 = 24\%\]

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is **24%**."
"First, we need to determine the total number of seats that are not reserved for graduates or faculty. The Fine Arts Center has a total capacity of 6000 seats. After reserving 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty, the remaining seats are:

\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 \]

These 4750 seats are available for distribution to the graduates to give to their friends and family. If these tickets are to be split equally among the 950 graduates, we divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ 5 \]"
"To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish the relationships between the different sizes of jelly beans and then use these relationships to find the answer.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large jelly beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium jelly beans Grandpa can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium jelly beans}
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium jelly bean.
   - Therefore, the number of small jelly beans equivalent to 150 medium jelly beans is:

"First, we need to determine how many soda bottles Richard will place on the driveway. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and he plans to place a bottle every 3 feet. This means the number of bottles is calculated by dividing the width of the driveway by the spacing between the bottles and then adding 1 (since he starts at the first bottle and places one at the beginning):

\[
\text{Number of bottles} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total time it will take Richard to place the candy in each bottle. Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next, and he needs to do this 8 times (from the first to the second, second to the third, and so on until the eighth to the ninth), the total time is:

\[
\text{Total time} = 8 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}

\[ 40 \text{ apples/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of apples he can make if each pack contains eight apples. We do this by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:

\[ 80 \text{ apples} \div 8 \text{ apples/pack} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make \(\boxed{10}\) packs of apples."
"First, calculate the total cost of the Parmesan cheese:
- Cost of Parmesan cheese per pound = $11
- Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese
- Total cost of Parmesan cheese = 2 pounds * $11/pound = $22

Next, calculate the total cost of the Mozzarella cheese:
- Cost of Mozzarella cheese per pound = $6
- Amor buys 3 pounds of Mozzarella cheese
- Total cost of Mozzarella cheese = 3 pounds * $6/pound = $18

Now, calculate the total cost of both types of cheese:
- Total cost of cheese = Cost of Parmesan cheese + Cost of Mozzarella cheese
- Total cost of cheese = $22 + $18 = $40

Finally, calculate the remaining money after the purchase:
- Amor starts with $50
- Total cost of cheese = $40
- Remaining money = $50 - $40 = $10

Therefore, the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat is $10."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of loans Jim takes out during his 4 years of college:
\[ 50,000 \text{ dollars/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 200,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's determine Jim's income before and after college:
- Before college, Jim earns $25,000 per year.
- After college, his income triples, so he earns:
\[ 25,000 \text{ dollars/year} \times 3 = 75,000 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Now, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college over the 4 years:
\[ 25,000 \text{ dollars/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 100,000 \text{ dollars} \]

After college, Jim will earn $75,000 per year. We need to find out how long it will take for him to earn the equivalent of the $200,000 in loans plus the $100,000 in lost income:
\[ 200,000 \text{ dollars} + 100,000 \text{ dollars} = 300,000 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how many years it will take for Jim to earn $300,000 at an annual income of $75,000:
\[ \frac{300,000 \text{ dollars}}{75,000 \text{ dollars/year}} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"First, we need to determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces Jim needs. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece is:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one fabric piece:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric he needs to buy is:
\[ \text{Total area} = 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total square footage of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Monday's Deliveries:**
   - The post office delivered 425 letters on Monday.

2. **Tuesday's Deliveries:**
   - One-fifth of Monday's deliveries: \(\frac{425}{5} = 85\)
   - Tuesday's deliveries: \(85 + 17 = 102\)

3. **Wednesday's Deliveries:**
   - Twice Tuesday's deliveries: \(2 \times 102 = 204\)
   - Wednesday's deliveries: \(204 + 5 = 209\)

4. **Total Deliveries from Monday to Wednesday:**
   - Monday: 425
   - Tuesday: 102
   - Wednesday: 209
   - Total: \(425 + 102 + 209 = 736\)

The post office delivered a total of 736 letters from Monday to Wednesday."
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost for each type of salad and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the chicken salad:
- 10 people want chicken salad.
- Each chicken salad costs $6.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for chicken salad is \(10 \times 6.50 = 65\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the pasta salad:
- 6 people want pasta salad.
- Each pasta salad costs $6.
- Therefore, the total cost for pasta salad is \(6 \times 6 = 36\) dollars.

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of chicken salad + cost of pasta salad
- Total cost = \(65 + 36 = 101\) dollars.

So, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is **101** dollars."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.
   - Loss = $-5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race = \(2 \times (-5) = -10\).
   - Winning amount = \(-10 + 1 = -9\).
   - Since winning is a positive amount, the amount won is $9.
   - Win = $9.

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Loss = \(1.5 \times 9 = 13.5\).
   - Loss = $-13.5.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost or won over the three races:
- First race loss: $-5.
- Second race win: $9.
- Third race loss: $-13.5.

Total amount = \(-5 + 9 - 13.5 = -9.5\).

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total amount by the number of races (3):
\[
\text{Average loss} = \frac{-9.5}{3} = -3.1667 \approx -3.17.
\]

So, the average loss per race is \(-3.17\).

**Final Answer:**
-3.17"
"To find the total population of South America based on the given information, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Determine the number of cities in South America.
2. Calculate the total population by multiplying the number of cities by the number of people in each city.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cities.
- There are 26 countries in South America.
- Each country has 5 cities.
- Therefore, the total number of cities is \(26 \times 5 = 130\).

Step 2: Calculate the total population.
- Each city has 1000 people.
- Therefore, the total population is \(130 \times 1000 = 130,000\).

So, the total population of South America, based on the given conditions, is 130,000 people."
"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll convert everything to inches since the growth is given in inches and one of the initial heights is already in inches.

Xavier's initial height is 4 feet. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we convert Xavier's height as follows:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer, so his current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's initial height is already given in inches as 50 inches. Cole grew 2 inches over the summer, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is:
\[ 1 \text{ inch} \]"
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \(x\). According to the problem:

- The second person took \(x + 80\).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \(2(x + 80)\).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation as:
\[x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920\]

Simplifying the equation:
\[x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920\]
\[4x + 240 = 1920\]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[4x = 1680\]

Divide by 4:
\[x = 420\]

So, the share of the first person is $420."
"To determine the total hours of work each painter put in, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the fraction of the day worked into hours:**
   - A full day has 24 hours.
   - The painters worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - Therefore, the hours worked per day per painter is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{8} \times 24 = \frac{3 \times 24}{8} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of days worked:**
   - The painters worked for 3 weeks.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of days is:
     \[
     3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total hours worked by the team:**
   - Each painter worked 9 hours per day.
   - There are 4 painters.
   - Therefore, the total hours worked by the team per day is:
     \[
     9 \times 4 = 36 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Over 21 days, the total hours worked by the team is:
     \[
     36 \times 21 = 756 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Calculate the hours worked by each painter:**
   - There are 4 painters.
   - Therefore, the hours worked by each painter is:
     \[
     \frac{756}{4} = 189 \text{ hours}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
Each painter put in 189 hours of work."
"Let's define the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
1. In the first set, he retrieved four more balls than in the second set, so he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
2. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
3. The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2 \cdot 2x + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} + 2 \cdot 4 = 2 \cdot 19 \]
\[ 4x + x + 8 = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to apply the depreciation rate of 21% per year for the years 2008 and 2009. The formula for depreciation is:

\[ \text{Value after depreciation} = \text{Original Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Given:
- Original Value = $20000
- Depreciation Rate = 21% = 0.21
- Number of Years = 2010 - 2007 = 3

Now, we calculate the value of the car in 2010:

\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 9860.78 \]

Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 is $9860.78."
"First, let's calculate the number of English books:
- Half of the 50 books are in English, so \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) books are in English.

Next, let's calculate the number of German books:
- 10% of the 50 books are in German, so \( 50 \times 0.10 = 5 \) books are in German.

Now, to find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:
- Total books = 50
- English books = 25
- German books = 5
- Spanish books = Total books - English books - German books
- Spanish books = 50 - 25 - 5 = 20

So, there are 20 Spanish books in the library."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we first calculate the total distance she has already covered and then subtract this from the total distance between San Diego and New York City.

1. Calculate the total distance Bernice has driven:
   \[
   \text{Distance driven} = 325 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 1300 \, \text{km}
   \]

2. Subtract the distance driven from the total distance:
   \[
   \text{Distance remaining} = 1955 \, \text{km} - 1300 \, \text{km} = 655 \, \text{km}
   \]

Bernice still needs to drive 655 kilometers."
"Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Over 30 days, she would drink:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, the number of gallons she drinks in 30 days is:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"Initially, there are 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train:
\[ 120 + 20 = 140 \]

At the second stop, 50 people descend, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train:
\[ 140 - 50 + 100 = 190 \]

At the third stop, 80 people descend:
\[ 190 - 80 = 110 \]

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is:
\[ 110 \]"

1. **Tank top**: $10
2. **Running shorts**: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. **Tennis shoes**: Originally $48, but on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. **Athletic socks**: Package originally $8, with a $2 coupon, so $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items before any discounts:

\[ 10 + 15 + 24 + 6 = 55 \]

So, Alison spent a total of $55 on athletic gear."
"To calculate the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to determine how many tiles are required and then multiply that by the cost per tile.

1. **Determine the number of tiles needed:**
   - Each tile is a square with a side length of 1ft, so the area of each tile is \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}\).
   - The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
   - Therefore, the number of tiles required is \(200 \text{ SqFt} \div 1 \text{ SqFt/tile} = 200 \text{ tiles}\).

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each tile costs $12.
   - The total cost is \(200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12/\text{tile} = \$2400\).

**Final Answer:**
The total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is \$2400."
"First, calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident. The insurance cost increased by 60% of the normal cost.

The normal cost is $120 a month. So, the increase is:
\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

Adding this increase to the normal cost gives the new monthly cost:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Now, to find the annual cost, multiply the new monthly cost by 12:
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

So, James pays $2304 a year."
"Greg uses 4 twin beds + 1 king bed = 5 sets of sheets per week.

Since his machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, he needs to do:
- 2 loads for the 4 twin beds (2 sets per load)
- 1 load for the 1 king bed

So, he does 2 + 1 = 3 loads per week.

In a year, there are 52 weeks, so he does:
3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year.

**156**"
"First, let's break down the number of movies watched each day:

- On Saturday, they watch 4 movies.
- On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) movies.

So, in one weekend (Saturday and Sunday), they watch a total of \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) movies.

Now, to find out how many movies they watch in 4 weeks, we multiply the number of movies watched in one weekend by 4:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so his collection increased to:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \text{ stickers} \]

This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as last year, which is:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ stickers} \]

Adding this year's collection to his last year's total:
\[ 150 + 100 = 250 \text{ stickers} \]

So, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's cats consume in one day. Since she feeds them twice a day with 60 grams each time, the daily consumption is:

\[ 60 \, \text{grams/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 120 \, \text{grams/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:

\[ 720 \, \text{grams} \div 120 \, \text{grams/day} = 6 \, \text{days} \]

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 6 days."
"First, let's determine how many slices each person ate based on the information given.

1. Becky ate 10 slices.
2. Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices.
3. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \(2 \times 7 = 14\) slices.

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia to find the total number of slices eaten.

\[
10 \text{ (Becky's slices)} + 7 \text{ (Jake's slices)} + 14 \text{ (Silvia's slices)} = 31 \text{ slices}

"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( D \) be the number of minutes Donovan's part took.
- Let \( B \) be the number of minutes Betsy's part took.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so we can write:
   \[
   B = D + 18
   \]
2. The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so:
   \[
   B + D = 98
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
(D + 18) + D = 98
\]
Simplify and solve for \( D \):
\[
2D + 18 = 98
\]
Subtract 18 from both sides:
\[
2D = 80
\]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[
D = 40
\]

Now that we know \( D \), we can find \( B \):
\[
B = D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58
\]

So, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. 

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{58}

"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to break down each component of the charges:

1. **Cost of the cast**: $200
2. **Doctor's visit charge**: The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the charge for the visit is:
   \[
   \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of painkillers**: Each painkiller costs $4, and she needs 30 painkillers, so the total cost for the painkillers is:
   \[
   4 \times 30 = 120 \text{ dollars}

**Total cost of the doctor's visit**: $482"
"First, we need to determine how many emails James receives in a day that require a response. Since 20% of the emails don't require any response, this means 80% of the emails do require a response.

To find 80% of 80 emails:
\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \]

So, James responds to 64 emails each day.

Next, we need to calculate how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week:
\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

Therefore, the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week is:
\[ 320 \]"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes for each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: 32 classes visited.
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes.
3. **Wednesday**: Three times as many as Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes.
4. **Thursday**: 30 classes visited.
5. **Friday**: 25 classes visited.

Now, we add the number of classes for each day:

"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate and how many are left from their order.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the glee club's order is:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's determine how many pizzas the football team ordered and how many they ate.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the football team's order is:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas} \]

Finally, we add the remaining pizzas from both the glee club and the football team to find the total number of pizzas left:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, the number of pizzas left is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each type of coupon Anthony is sending out.

Anthony is sending out 700 small coupons. Since he wants to send out twice as many big coupons, the number of big coupons is:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:
\[ 24500 \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:
\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered. Since Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, we calculate:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \]

So, Sidney initially ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in these 7 sub sandwiches is:

\[ 7 \times 4 = 28 \]

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. Therefore, the number of sub sandwiches remaining is:

\[ 7 - 4 = 3 \]

Sidney then ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, so the total number of sub sandwiches Sidney has now is:

\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \]

Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the 6 sub sandwiches is:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Thus, the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is:

\[ \boxed{24} \]"

"Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. Since he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion where you get one pound of butter for full price and the second pound for half off. The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound.

For 6 pounds of butter, the cost calculation would be as follows:
- The first pound costs $4.00.
- The second pound costs $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
- This pattern repeats for the 6 pounds.

So, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter would be:
\[ 4.00 + 2.00 + 4.00 + 2.00 + 4.00 + 2.00 = 18.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter is $18.00."
"First, let's determine the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- Kayla invited 25 classmates.
- She also invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.

So, the total number of guests invited is:
\[ 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 \]

Next, we need to account for the fact that 4 people said they could not come. Therefore, the number of people who will actually attend the party is:
\[ 45 - 4 = 41 \]

The theater rental fee is a flat $125 for the first 20 guests. For each additional guest beyond the first 20, the fee is $6. The number of additional guests is:
\[ 41 - 20 = 21 \]

The cost for the additional guests is:
\[ 21 \times 6 = 126 \]

Adding the flat fee and the additional guest fee gives the total cost:
\[ 125 + 126 = 251 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the party is:
\[ \boxed{251} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Maggie and Riza each had initially.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has three-quarters of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times \text{Maggie's initial money} = 60
\]

To find Maggie's initial amount of money, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Maggie's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
\]

So, Maggie initially had $80.

Next, Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has two-thirds of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times \text{Riza's initial money} = 60
\]

To find Riza's initial amount of money, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Riza's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
\]

So, Riza initially had $90.

Now, let's calculate how much money each of them spent:

- Maggie spent \(\frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20\) dollars.
- Riza spent \(\frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30\) dollars.

To find out how much money they have left in total, we add the remaining amounts:

\[
60 + 60 = 120
\]

Therefore, the two of them have \(\boxed{120}\) dollars left."
"First, let's determine the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys each day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys each day:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Since the total number of bananas is enough to feed the three monkeys for a week (7 days), we can find the total number of bananas consumed by all three monkeys in a week:
\[ 315 \text{ bananas} \]

To find the total number of bananas consumed by all three monkeys each day, we divide the total weekly consumption by 7:
\[ \frac{315}{7} = 45 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Now, we know that the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas after the first two monkeys have eaten. So, the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day is:
\[ 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas each day} \]

Therefore, the third monkey eats:
\[ \boxed{21} \text{ bananas each day} \]"
"Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed 250 pieces. Then, he started and finished another 500 piece puzzle. 

So, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is:

250 (from the first puzzle) + 500 (from the second puzzle) = 750 pieces.

Therefore, Teddy placed 750 puzzle pieces during that hour."
"First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for 15 roses is:
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has initially. She arrived with five $5 bills, so she has:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she does not have enough money to buy the roses. Therefore, she cannot complete the purchase and will not receive any change.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 0 \text{ quarters} \]"
"To find out how much money Terry makes in total, we need to calculate the earnings from each item and then sum them up.

1. **Milkshakes:**
   - Number of milkshakes: 6
   - Price per milkshake: $5.50
   - Total from milkshakes: \( 6 \times 5.50 = 33 \) dollars

2. **Burger Platters:**
   - Number of burger platters: 9
   - Price per burger platter: $11
   - Total from burger platters: \( 9 \times 11 = 99 \) dollars

3. **Sodas:**
   - Number of sodas: 20
   - Price per soda: $1.50
   - Total from sodas: \( 20 \times 1.50 = 30 \) dollars

Now, we sum up the totals from each item:
\[ 33 + 99 + 30 = 162 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Terry makes is:
\[ \boxed{162} \] dollars."
"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find the difference between the time Paul boards the fourth train and the time he arrives at the station.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Departs after 30 minutes (10 + 20).

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train departs, which is 60 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 5 minutes (20 / 4).
   - Departs after 65 minutes (60 + 5).

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train departs, which is 125 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives, so it departs at 125 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train departs, which is 145 minutes after the first train arrives.

Paul will board the fourth train 145 minutes after he arrives at the station. Since he arrives at the station at the start (0 minutes), he will wait for 145 minutes.

**Final Answer:**
145 minutes"
"First, we need to determine how many toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to collect to reach her goal of 200 toothpicks. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of toothpicks she already has from the total number she needs:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie continues to save at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week, we can determine how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks by dividing the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie \(\boxed{8}\) more weeks to collect the remaining 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price of the watch.

\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{\text{Original Price} - \text{Price Paid by Friend}}{\text{Original Price}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{2000 - 1800}{2000} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is \(10\%\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs over a period of 4 hours, given that each spring creates one jellyfish every second.

1. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - 1 minute = 60 seconds
   - Therefore, 1 hour = 60 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 3600 seconds
   - 4 hours = 4 * 3600 seconds = 14400 seconds

2. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since one spring creates one jellyfish every second, in 14400 seconds, one spring will create 14400 jellyfish.

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create 5 * 14400 jellyfish.
   - 5 * 14400 = 72000 jellyfish

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is 72000."
"Frankie's score was 15 better than twice Binkie's score. Since Binkie's score was 90, we can calculate Frankie's score as follows:

1. Twice Binkie's score: \(2 \times 90 = 180\)
2. 15 more than twice Binkie's score: \(180 + 15 = 195\)

Therefore, Frankie's score was 195."
"James walked a total distance of 4 miles to the store and then 2 miles back home (since he had to walk back halfway), making it 6 miles in total. Given that he walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time taken as follows:

Total distance = 6 miles
Speed = 4 miles per hour

Time = Total distance / Speed
Time = 6 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1.5 hours

It took James 1.5 hours to reach the store."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from buying 10 bunches. Since each bunch averages 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we calculate the cost if Jenny bought these bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80, so the total cost for 40 bananas is:

\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since she bought 10 bunches and each bunch costs $3.00, the total cost is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:

\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Jenny saved \(\$2.00\)."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \) feet. According to the problem, the total length of the fence is 100 feet, and Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam. We can set up the following equations based on the information given:

1. \( S + H = 100 \)
2. \( H = S + 60 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]
\[ 2S = 100 - 60 \]
\[ 2S = 40 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The amount left over for Sam is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate per year. 

Given:
- The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years.

The growth rate per year is:
\[ \text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \]

Now, to find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we multiply the growth rate per year by 13 years:
\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the crocodile will grow \(\boxed{26}\) inches in 13 years."
"First, let's determine the number of each type of bike sold.

1. **Trekking Bikes:**
   - Half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes.
   - Number of Trekking bikes = \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \).

2. **BMX Bikes:**
   - 15% of the 300 bikes sold were BMX bikes.
   - Number of BMX bikes = \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \).

3. **MTB Bikes:**
   - The rest of the bikes sold were MTB bikes.
   - Number of MTB bikes = Total bikes - Trekking bikes - BMX bikes
   - Number of MTB bikes = \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \).

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike.

1. **Earnings from Trekking Bikes:**
   - Price of one Trekking bike = $450.
   - Total earnings from Trekking bikes = \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \).

2. **Earnings from BMX Bikes:**
   - Price of one BMX bike = \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \).
   - Total earnings from BMX bikes = \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \).

3. **Earnings from MTB Bikes:**
   - Price of one MTB bike = $500.
   - Total earnings from MTB bikes = \( 105 \times 500 = 52500 \).

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes to find the total earnings.

- Total earnings = Earnings from Trekking bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from MTB bikes
- Total earnings = \( 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = 131250 \).

Therefore, Marcel earned \(\boxed{131250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."
"To determine how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the net number of bales added to or removed from the field each hour and then multiply by the number of hours in a day.

1. The farmer makes 5 bales of hay each hour.
2. The truck picks up 3 bales of hay each hour.
3. The net change in the number of bales each hour is \(5 - 3 = 2\) bales.

Over a 6-hour day, the total change in the number of bales is:
\[2 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ bales}.\]

Since the farmer is making more bales than the truck is picking up, the number of bales in the field increases by 12 bales over the 6-hour period.

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field at the end of the day is:
\[12 \text{ bales}.\]"
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long.

\[ \text{Total class time per day} = 8 \times 40 \text{ minutes} = 320 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total class time for the week is:

\[ \text{Total class time per week} = 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 1600 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly class time on these days.

\[ \text{Extra learning time per week} = \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the class time and the extra learning time to get the total learning time per week:

\[ \text{Total learning time per week} = 1600 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 1700 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the total learning time from minutes to hours:

\[ \text{Total learning time in hours} = \frac{1700 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = \frac{1700}{60} \approx 28.33 \text{ hours} \]

So, John spends approximately 28.33 hours a week learning."
"To determine how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial drop height:**
   - The ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony.
   - Each story is 24 feet high.
   - Therefore, the initial drop height is \(3 \times 24 = 72\) feet.

2. **Calculate the height after the first bounce:**
   - The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height.
   - So, the height after the first bounce is \(72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48\) feet.

3. **Calculate the height after the second bounce:**
   - Again, the ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its current height.
   - So, the height after the second bounce is \(48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32\) feet.

Therefore, the ball goes to a height of 32 feet on its second bounce."
"First, let's convert the height of the first child from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child is \(6 \times 12 = 72\) inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is \(72 + 2 = 74\) inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is \(74 - 5 = 69\) inches.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is \(69 + 3 = 72\) inches.

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is 72 inches."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many bags of apples were sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings based on the price per bag.

**Step 1: Determine the number of bags sold.**

Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total earnings.**

Each bag is sold for $5, so we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

**Final Answer:**
\[ \text{The orchard earned } 1000 \text{ dollars}. \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the 270 kilograms of meat that were left after the scavenging and the T-Rex's meal.

1. **After the Allosaurus ate:** 270 kg was the last amount of meat left.
2. **Before the Allosaurus ate:** The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kg, which means the 270 kg was half of what was left before the Allosaurus ate. Therefore, before the Allosaurus ate, there were \(270 \times 2 = 540\) kg of meat.

3. **Before the Velociraptors scavenged:** The 540 kg was half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. Therefore, before the Velociraptors scavenged, there were \(540 \times 2 = 1080\) kg of meat.

4. **Before the T-Rex ate:** The 1080 kg was half of the original amount of meat on the triceratops. Therefore, the original amount of meat on the triceratops was \(1080 \times 2 = 2160\) kg.

The triceratops originally had 2160 kilograms of meat."
"First, calculate the area of the north and south walls:
- Each wall is 10 feet by 8 feet, so the area of one wall is \(10 \times 8 = 80\) square feet.
- Since there are two walls, the total area for the north and south walls is \(80 \times 2 = 160\) square feet.

Next, calculate the area of the east and west walls:
- Each wall is 5 feet by 8 feet, so the area of one wall is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) square feet.
- Since there are two walls, the total area for the east and west walls is \(40 \times 2 = 80\) square feet.

Now, add the areas of all four walls to get the total area to be painted:
- Total area = \(160 + 80 = 240\) square feet.

Next, determine how many gallons of paint are needed:
- One gallon covers 20 square feet, so the number of gallons needed is \(\frac{240}{20} = 12\) gallons.

Finally, calculate the total cost:
- Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost is \(12 \times 12 = 144\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{144}

"First, let's determine the initial conditions:
- Total sodas: 12
- Shaken sodas: 3
- Unshaken sodas: 12 - 3 = 9

Ellen took 1 unshaken soda for herself, so the remaining sodas are:
- Shaken sodas: 3
- Unshaken sodas: 9 - 1 = 8

Ellen's brother then took 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas, so the remaining sodas are:
- Shaken sodas: 3 - 1 = 2
- Unshaken sodas: 8 - 2 = 6

Now, Ellen's friend comes along and takes 1 soda. We need to find the probability that the soda taken by Ellen's friend is shaken.

The total number of sodas left is 2 (shaken) + 6 (unshaken) = 8.

The probability that the soda taken by Ellen's friend is shaken is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this probability as a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 25%."
"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then sum these distances.

1. The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, the distance it covers is:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is:
   \[
   \text{Speed}_2 = \frac{60 \, \text{miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour}
   \]
   After 3 hours, the distance it covers is:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. The total distance between the two trains after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each has traveled:
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 180 \, \text{miles} + 90 \, \text{miles} = 270 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Therefore, the two trains are 270 miles apart after 3 hours."
"First, let's determine the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.

- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th is 19 days.

Adding these together, the total number of days is:
\[ 31 + 19 = 50 \text{ days} \]

Next, we need to calculate how many days Billy takes off. He takes 20% of the days off:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \text{ days} \]

So, the number of days he works is:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ days} \]

Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day. Therefore, the number of people he helps per day is:
\[ 2 \text{ people/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 6 \text{ people/day} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of people he helps over the 40 days:
\[ 6 \text{ people/day} \times 40 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ people} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry.

First, let's calculate the number of people that the buses could carry:
- There are 12 buses.
- Each bus carried 35 people.

\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people per bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of people that the cars could carry:
- There are 20 cars.
- Each car carried 3 people.

\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people per car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Now, we add the number of people from the buses and the cars to find the total number of people inside the church:

\[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people inside the church is:

\[ \boxed{480} \]"
"To find out how old Jeff is, we can set up the relationships given in the problem using variables and then solve the equations.

1. Let's denote Jeff's age by \( J \).
2. Let's denote Martha's age by \( M \).
3. Let's denote Mike's age by \( K \).

From the problem, we know:
- Jeff is 10 years older than Martha: \( J = M + 10 \)
- Martha is 4 years younger than Mike: \( M = K - 4 \)
- Mike is 24 years old: \( K = 24 \)

First, substitute Mike's age into the equation for Martha's age:
\[ M = 24 - 4 = 20 \]

Now, substitute Martha's age into the equation for Jeff's age:
\[ J = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old."
"To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each slide and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the biggest slide:
- Length of the biggest slide: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute

Time to slide down the biggest slide:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the second biggest slide:
- Length of the second biggest slide: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute

Time to slide down the second biggest slide:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:
\[ \text{Difference in time} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"First, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks each day.

- Lunch: 30 minutes
- Breaks: 2 breaks × 15 minutes each = 30 minutes

So, each day, Bobby spends:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes (lunch)} + 30 \text{ minutes (breaks)} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, Bobby spends 1 hour each day on lunch and breaks.

Over 5 days, the total time spent on lunch and breaks is:
\[ 1 \text{ hour/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (\text{Amber's distance} + \text{Micah's distance}) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (8 + 28) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - 36 \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles."

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is:
\[ \frac{1}{5}J \]

A third of these large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \]

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 15:
\[ J = 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs for her retirement and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount given her current savings rate.

1. **Calculate the annual retirement income needed:**
   Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary during retirement.
   \[
   \text{Annual retirement income} = 0.40 \times \$100,000 = \$40,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the total retirement savings needed:**
   Lauren plans to live in retirement for 20 years.
   \[
   \text{Total retirement savings needed} = \$40,000 \times 20 = \$800,000
   \]

3. **Determine the annual savings:**
   Lauren saves 20% of her current annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual savings} = 0.20 \times \$100,000 = \$20,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of years needed to save the total retirement amount:**
   \[
   \text{Number of years needed} = \frac{\$800,000}{\$20,000} = 40 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her retirement."
"First, we need to determine the length of each of the 4 equal parts of the ribbon. Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon, and he needs to divide it into 4 equal parts. So, we divide 100 by 4:

\[ \frac{100}{4} = 25 \text{ centimeters} \]

Each of these 25 centimeter parts is then to be divided into 5 equal parts. So, we divide 25 by 5:

\[ \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ centimeters} \]

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long. 

The final answer is:
\[ 5 \text{ centimeters} \]"
"To find the total school population, we start by noting that 40% of the school population is 240 boys. Let's denote the total school population by \( P \).

Given:
\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we solve for \( P \):
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ P = 600 \]

So, the total school population is 600.

Since 40% of the school population is boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of the total population:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."

"To find the average height of the heels at the party, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total height of all the heels.
2. Divide the total height by the number of women to find the average.

First, let's calculate the total height of the heels:
- Three women are wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

Adding these together gives the total height of all the heels:
\[12 + 6 = 18 \text{ inches}\]

Next, we need to find the average height of the heels. There are 6 women in total, so we divide the total height by 6:
\[\frac{18}{6} = 3 \text{ inches}\]

Therefore, the average height of the heels at the party is \(\boxed{3}\) inches."
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike in June.
2. Determine the total number of days in June.
3. Calculate the total miles she plans to hike per day.
4. Determine the additional miles she needs to hike per day to meet her goal.

First, the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike is 9,300 miles.

June has 30 days.

So, if she hikes twice a day, covering 125 miles each time, the total miles she plans to hike per day is:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/time} \times 2 \text{ times/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many miles she needs to hike per day to complete 9,300 miles in 30 days:
\[ \frac{9,300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, the additional miles she needs to hike per day is:
\[ 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

Therefore, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time."

"First, let's determine how much Pierre and Paul want in terms of the total 12 kg of apples.

Pierre wants a quarter of the apples:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \, \text{kg} = 3 \, \text{kg} \]

Paul wants one-third of the apples:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 \, \text{kg} = 4 \, \text{kg} \]

Together, Pierre and Paul want:
\[ 3 \, \text{kg} + 4 \, \text{kg} = 7 \, \text{kg} \]

Since the total amount of apples is 12 kg, the amount left for Jacques (and by extension, the amount Pierre, Paul, and Jacques collectively have minus what Pierre and Paul took) is:
\[ 12 \, \text{kg} - 7 \, \text{kg} = 5 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \, \text{kg} \]"
"To find the final temperature, we need to follow the changes step by step.

1. The initial temperature was 2 degrees Celsius.
2. It dropped by 8 degrees Celsius overnight. So, the new temperature is:
   \[
   2 - 8 = -6 \text{ degrees Celsius}
   \]
3. In the morning, the temperature increased by 3 degrees Celsius. So, the final temperature is:

   \]

Therefore, the temperature in the morning was \(-3\) degrees Celsius."
"Raymond initially had $21. He saved an additional $11, so his total amount of money became:

\[ 21 + 11 = 32 \]

Next, he spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle. The total amount spent is:

\[ 5 + 19 = 24 \]

Subtracting the total amount spent from the total amount of money he had:

\[ 32 - 24 = 8 \]

So, Raymond has \(\boxed{8}\) dollars left."
"First, let's determine how much money Anna spent in total. She started with a budget of $16 and has $2 left after her purchases. Therefore, the total amount spent is:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Next, we know that Anna had already spent $4 before buying the 2 books today. So, the amount spent on the 2 books is:

\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Since she bought 2 books and they cost the same amount, the cost of each book is:

\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, each book cost $5. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we first calculate the increase in enrollment based on last year's number of students, which was 50.

The increase is 20% of 50. To calculate 20% of 50, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Increase} = \text{Last Year's Enrollment} \times \frac{\text{Percentage Increase}}{100} \]

\[ \text{Increase} = 50 \times \frac{20}{100} \]

\[ \text{Increase} = 50 \times 0.20 \]

\[ \text{Increase} = 10 \]

So, there is an increase of 10 students this year. To find the total number of students enrolled this year, we add this increase to last year's enrollment:

\[ \text{This Year's Enrollment} = \text{Last Year's Enrollment} + \text{Increase} \]

\[ \text{This Year's Enrollment} = 50 + 10 \]

\[ \text{This Year's Enrollment} = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion based on the rate at which the light blinks. The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. We need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times.

First, let's set up the proportion:

\[
\frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{x \text{ minutes}}
\]

We can solve for \(x\) by cross-multiplying:

\[
255x = 459 \times 5
\]

\[
255x = 2295
\]

Now, divide both sides by 255 to solve for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{2295}{255}
\]

\[
x = 9
\]

So, it will take 9 minutes for the light to blink 459 times.

\[
\boxed{9 \text{ minutes}}

"First, let's calculate the initial number of male and female fishes in Tate's garden pond:

- Male guppies: 4
- Female guppies: 7
- Male goldfishes: 3
- Female goldfishes: 5

Total male fishes initially:
\[ 4 \text{ (male guppies)} + 3 \text{ (male goldfishes)} = 7 \]

Total female fishes initially:
\[ 7 \text{ (female guppies)} + 5 \text{ (female goldfishes)} = 12 \]

Next, let's account for the new additions:

- Male guppies added: 2
- Female guppies added: 1
- Male goldfishes added: 2
- Female goldfishes added: 3

Total male fishes after additions:
\[ 7 \text{ (initial male fishes)} + 2 \text{ (added male guppies)} + 2 \text{ (added male goldfishes)} = 11 \]

Total female fishes after additions:
\[ 12 \text{ (initial female fishes)} + 1 \text{ (added female guppies)} + 3 \text{ (added female goldfishes)} = 16 \]

Now, we need to find how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has:
\[ 16 \text{ (total female fishes)} - 11 \text{ (total male fishes)} = 5 \]

Therefore, Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes."
"First, let's break down the time each person took to complete their chores:

1. **Amalia's time**: Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.
2. **Megan's time**: Megan's chore took 2 hours longer than Amalia's, so:
   \[
   4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]
3. **Dior's time**: Dior's chore took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia's, so:
   \[
   4 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} + \text{some additional time} > 8 \text{ hours}
   \]
   Since the problem states ""well over 4 hours longer,"" we can assume the minimum additional time is just over 4 hours, but for simplicity in calculation, we can use 8 hours as a base and add a small increment, but for the total, we can use 8 hours as a practical lower bound.

Now, we sum up the times:
\[
4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is:
\[
\boxed{18 \text{ hours}}

"To determine the total miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the one-way distance:**
   - John drives for 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles (one way)

2. **Calculate the round trip distance:**
   - Round trip distance = 2 × One-way distance
   - Round trip distance = 2 × 140 miles = 280 miles

3. **Calculate the total distance for two visits a month:**
   - John visits his parents twice a month.
   - Total distance per month = 2 × Round trip distance
   - Total distance per month = 2 × 280 miles = 560 miles

Therefore, the total miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents is **560 miles**."
"Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. Over 7 days, she will walk:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, the distance Brian will walk in 7 days is:

\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days."
"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the other four workers and then find out how many toys are still needed to meet the order, which will help us find the production rate of the fifth worker.

First, let's calculate the total production of the first two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.
- Over a 10-hour shift, they produce \(12 \times 10 = 120\) toys.

Next, let's calculate the total production of the next two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.
- Over a 10-hour shift, they produce \(8 \times 10 = 80\) toys.

Now, let's find the total production of the first four workers:
- The first two workers produce 120 toys.
- The next two workers produce 80 toys.
- Together, they produce \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys.

The order requires 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. This means that the first four workers have produced \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

Let \(x\) be the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour. Over a 10-hour shift, the fifth worker produces \(10x\) toys.

The total production of all five workers is:
\[ 200 + 10x = 380 \]

Solving for \(x\):
\[ 10x = 380 - 200 \]
\[ 10x = 180 \]
\[ x = \frac{180}{10} \]
\[ x = 18 \]

Therefore, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"First, let's determine the weight of each of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds.

1. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we add the weights of all three dogs to find the total weight:
\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog}
\]
\[
\text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is 105 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

1. **Rob received 7 stickers from Kris.**
   - Before giving to Rob, Kris had \(7 + 9 = 16\) stickers.

2. **Kris received 16 stickers from Luis.**
   - Since Luis gave half of his stickers to Kris, Luis originally had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.

3. **Luis received 32 stickers from Seth.**
   - Since Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, Seth originally had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

Therefore, Seth had \(\boxed{64}\) stickers in the beginning."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of M&Ms John has:

3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces

Next, we calculate the total number of M&Ms he has:

30 ounces * 30 M&Ms per ounce = 900 M&Ms

Now, we need to find out how many small bags he can make if each small bag contains 10 M&Ms:

900 M&Ms / 10 M&Ms per small bag = 90 small bags

Therefore, John can make 90 small bags of M&Ms."
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate half of the circumference of the earth.
2. Determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly that distance.

First, the circumference of the earth is given as 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Next, we know that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies per day:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equation based on the information given.

1. Let \( V \) be Vince's current age.
2. Liam's current age is 16 years.
3. Two years ago, Liam's age was \( 16 - 2 = 14 \) years.
4. Two years ago, Vince's age was \( V - 2 \) years.

According to the problem, two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. So, we can write the equation:
\[ 14 = 2 \times (V - 2) \]

Now, let's solve for \( V \):
\[ 14 = 2V - 4 \]
\[ 14 + 4 = 2V \]
\[ 18 = 2V \]
\[ V = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ V = 9 \]

So, Vince is currently 9 years old.

Vince is currently 9 years old."
"Let's define the variables for the number of eggs each person painted:
- Let \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted.
- Let \( M \) be the number of eggs Madeline painted.
- Let \( C \) be the number of eggs Camden painted.
- Let \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \( A = M \).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \( C + S = 30 \).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah: \( C = S + 12 \).

First, we can substitute the expression for \( C \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now that we know \( S = 9 \), we can find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Next, we know the total number of eggs painted is 56:
\[ A + M + C + S = 56 \]
Since \( A = M \), we can substitute \( M \) with \( A \):
\[ A + A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Now we know:
- Arnold painted 13 eggs.
- Madeline painted 13 eggs.
- Camden painted 21 eggs.
- Sarah painted 9 eggs.

Finally, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Since each group of crayons will be placed in a box, Nik will need 25 boxes.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce and there are 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we calculate the total weight of the boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, and there are 25 boxes:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much of the tree can be made into logs. John can make logs out of 80% of the 80-foot tree.

\[ 80\% \text{ of } 80 \text{ feet} = 0.80 \times 80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs can be cut from these 64 feet of wood.

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet per log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

From each log, John cuts 5 planks. Therefore, the total number of planks he can get from all the logs is:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks per log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

John sells each plank for $1.2. Therefore, the total amount he makes from selling all the planks is:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times \$1.2 \text{ per plank} = \$96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$96 \]"
"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns $5000 per month and this is half of what her brother earns, her brother earns:

\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we calculate their combined salary:
\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so:
\[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we add up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother to find the total amount of money they all have together:
\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all have together is:
\[ 45000 \]"
"First, let's determine the rate at which Grandma walks on the beach. If she spends 40 minutes walking 2 miles on the beach, her speed on the beach is:

\[ \text{Speed on beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since she walks at twice the rate on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:

\[ \text{Speed on sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes her to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk at this speed:

\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk gives us the total time for the 3-mile walk:

\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

"First, let's calculate how much Jane has saved so far. She saves $4 every week and has been saving for 8 weeks.

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal.

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine how many more weeks it will take for her to save the remaining $28, given that she saves $4 each week.

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

\[ \boxed{7} \]"

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is **32**."
"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob originally has.

1. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24.
2. Therefore, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. This means that before receiving the 24 marbles, Bob had \(60 - 24 = 36\) marbles.

Now, we need to find out how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 of his marbles.

3. Bob originally has 36 marbles. If he loses 10 marbles, he will have \(36 - 10 = 26\) marbles.

Final numerical answer:

"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water, we need to ensure that after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into the water bottle, the resulting mixture is at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of \( T \)-degree water into the water bottle, the resulting mixture will be a weighted average of the two temperatures. The formula for the resulting temperature \( T_{\text{result}} \) is:

\[
T_{\text{result}} = \frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{4 + 1}
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
T_{\text{result}} = \frac{132 + T}{5}
\]

We know that Donny can drink the water if the resulting temperature is at least 40 degrees. Therefore, we set up the inequality:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

To solve for \( T \), we first multiply both sides of the inequality by 5:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Next, we subtract 132 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Thus, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after pouring the specified amounts.

\[
\boxed{68}

"First, let's calculate the total cost for 4 packs of bagels before the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so for 4 packs, the cost is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = \$40.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times 40 = \$4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total:
\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost per bagel by dividing the total cost by the number of bagels:
\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \text{ per bagel} \]

So, the cost per single bagel is:
\[ \$1.00 \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of scoops Gomer ate:**
   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This can be calculated as: \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops.

2. **Determine the relationship between scoops and potatoes:**
   - It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This can be simplified to: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes for \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops.
   - Therefore, 1 scoop requires \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes.

3. **Calculate the number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   - Since 1 scoop requires \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes, 18 scoops will require \( 18 \times \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes.
   - This can be calculated as: \( 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 18 \times 1.5 = 27 \) potatoes.

Therefore, the number of potatoes Gomer ate is \( 27 \)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:
- Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days, so he eats \(3 \times 30 = 90\) eggs.

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days:
- Chester eats 5 eggs a day for 30 days, so he eats \(5 \times 30 = 150\) eggs.

Now, let's find the total number of eggs Chester eats over the 60 days:
- Total eggs = \(90 + 150 = 240\) eggs.

To convert the total number of eggs into dozens, we divide by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12 eggs):
- Total dozens of eggs = \(240 \div 12 = 20\) dozens.

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"First, let's determine the number of red jelly beans. Since there are twice as many red jelly beans as green jelly beans, and there are 17 green jelly beans, we can calculate the number of red jelly beans as follows:

\[ \text{Number of red jelly beans} = 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Next, we know the total number of jelly beans in the jar is 60. We can find the number of blue jelly beans by subtracting the number of green and red jelly beans from the total number of jelly beans:

\[ \text{Number of blue jelly beans} = 60 - (\text{Number of green jelly beans} + \text{Number of red jelly beans}) \]
\[ \text{Number of blue jelly beans} = 60 - (17 + 34) \]
\[ \text{Number of blue jelly beans} = 60 - 51 \]
\[ \text{Number of blue jelly beans} = 9 \]

Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is 9."

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the initial number of men and women on the bus based on the given ratio and total number of passengers.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total parts of the ratio are \(5 + 9 = 14\).

Given that the total number of passengers is 84, we can find the value of one part of the ratio by dividing the total number of passengers by the total parts of the ratio:
\[ \text{Value of one part} = \frac{84}{14} = 6 \]

Now, we can find the initial number of men and women:
- Number of men = \(5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9 \times 6 = 54\)

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[ 54 - 20 = 34 \]

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sunflowers sold by Faraday over a period of 3 days. We can break this down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day:**
   - The cost of a single sunflower is $2.
   - The cost of a bouquet of sunflowers is $8, and each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
   - Faraday earns $26 from selling sunflowers per day.
   - Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets per day.

2. **Determine the number of sunflowers sold from the earnings from sunflowers alone:**
   - Since each sunflower is sold for $2, the number of sunflowers sold per day is calculated by dividing the daily earnings from sunflowers by the price per sunflower.
   - Number of sunflowers sold per day = $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers.

3. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days:**
   - Total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days = 13 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 39 sunflowers.

Therefore, the total number of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days is 39."
"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Each rock costs $5, so:

\[ \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Next, we need to find out how many rocks he sells. He sells 60% of his inventory:

\[ \text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \]

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling these rocks. Each rock is sold for $7:

\[ \text{Revenue} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \]

Adam's initial investment was $100, and his revenue from selling the rocks is $84. The loss is the difference between his initial investment and the revenue:

\[ \text{Loss} = 100 - 84 = 16 \]

Therefore, Adam loses $16."

"To find the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket.
2. Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners.

### Step 1: Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket
The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a probability of 0.20. The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning for the second ticket is:
\[ 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners
Since the events are independent, the combined probability of both tickets being winners is the product of their individual probabilities:
\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

Expressing this as a percentage:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is:

"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily energy demand for 2300 people:**
   - Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
   - Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, Hortex needs to produce 5 bottles (since \(100\% / 20\% = 5\)).

2. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed for 2300 people:**
   - For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required is \(2300 \times 5 = 11500\) bottles.

3. **Determine the current production capacity:**
   - Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.

4. **Calculate the additional number of bottles needed:**
   - The additional number of bottles required is \(11500 - 4200 = 7300\) bottles.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of octuplets**: 8

2. **Number of octuplets dressed in purple**: \(\frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6\)

3. **Number of octuplets dressed in blue**: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\)

4. **Number of blue-wearers wearing bows**: 2 (since all blue-wearers wear bows)

5. **Number of purple-wearers wearing bows**: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\)

6. **Total number of octuplets wearing bows**: \(2 + 2 = 4\)

7. **Number of purple-wearers wearing bows**: 2

To find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we use the conditional probability formula:

\[ P(\text{Purple} | \text{Bow}) = \frac{P(\text{Purple and Bow})}{P(\text{Bow})} \]

Here, \(P(\text{Purple and Bow})\) is the probability that a baby is both wearing purple and a bow, which is \(\frac{2}{8}\) (since 2 out of 8 are purple and wearing a bow).

And \(P(\text{Bow})\) is the probability that a baby is wearing a bow, which is \(\frac{4}{8}\) (since 4 out of 8 are wearing a bow).

So,

\[ P(\text{Purple} | \text{Bow}) = \frac{\frac{2}{8}}{\frac{4}{8}} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is \(50\%\)."
"To find out how many tax reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total number of reports received last week.

First, let's add up the reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:
- Monday and Tuesday: 1907 reports
- Thursday and Friday: 2136 reports

Total for these days: \(1907 + 2136 = 4043\) reports

Now, subtract this total from the overall total of reports received last week:
- Total reports received last week: 5168 reports

Reports received on Wednesday: \(5168 - 4043 = 1125\)

So, the IRS received 1125 tax reports on Wednesday."
"First, let's determine how much land Abraham sold in the first transaction. He sold half of his 80 square meters of land:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \text{ square meters} \]

So, he sold 40 square meters for $50. This means the price per square meter for the first transaction is:

\[ \frac{50}{40} = 1.25 \text{ dollars per square meter} \]

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land after a month. The amount of land he sold in the second transaction is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \text{ square meters} \]

He sold these 20 square meters for $30. This means the price per square meter for the second transaction is:

\[ \frac{30}{20} = 1.50 \text{ dollars per square meter} \]

Now, let's calculate the remaining land after the first two transactions. He initially had 80 square meters, sold 40 square meters, and then another 20 square meters, so the remaining land is:

\[ 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ square meters} \]

He sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter, so the money earned from the remaining land is:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up all the money he earned from selling the land:

\[ 50 + 30 + 60 = 140 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is:

\[ \boxed{140} \]"
"To find Geb's age, we start by setting up the relationship given in the problem. The problem states that Geb is 10 less than half the age of Haley. If Haley is 26 years old, we can express Geb's age with the following equation:

\[ \text{Geb's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Haley's age} - 10 \]

Substituting Haley's age (26) into the equation:

\[ \text{Geb's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times 26 - 10 \]

First, calculate half of Haley's age:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 26 = 13 \]

Then, subtract 10 from this result:

\[ 13 - 10 = 3 \]

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old. 

Geb's age is 3."
"Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. If he goes out three times a day, the number of face masks he uses per day is calculated as follows:

\[ 2 \text{ masks/go} \times 3 \text{ go/day} = 6 \text{ masks/day} \]

To find out how many face masks he uses every 2 days, we multiply the daily usage by 2:

\[ 6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks} \]

Therefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen eggs equal \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

To find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei from the initial number of eggs:

Total eggs found = \(5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\)

Eggs still hidden = Initial number of eggs - Total eggs found
                  = \(36 - 27 = 9\)

"First, let's determine the number of apartments in the third complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have \(200 + 200 = 400\) apartments. The third complex is 60% bigger than this combined total, so it has \(400 + 0.60 \times 400 = 400 + 240 = 640\) apartments.

Next, we calculate the total number of apartments John collects from all three complexes:
\[200 + 200 + 640 = 1040\]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, so the total number of collections per week is:
\[1040 \times 3 = 3120\]

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so the total amount of money he makes in a week is:
\[3120 \times 0.40 = 1248\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{1248}

"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. Let's denote the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces as \(x\). Therefore, the 8-year-old tree produces \(x - 200\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

We know that the 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than the 10-year-old tree. So, we can write:
\[x - 200 = 1000 - 200 = 800\]
Thus, the 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits, and the 8-year-old tree produces 800 fruits.

Now, we can sum up the fruits produced each year:
\[50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2450\]

Therefore, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is \(\boxed{2450}\)."
"First, let's determine how much money Sophia gave to Jack. Sophia had $100 and gave Jack 1/5 of it. 

To find 1/5 of $100:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20 \]

So, Sophia gave Jack $20.

Now, we add the $20 that Sophia gave Jack to the $100 Jack originally had:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \]

Therefore, Jack now has $120."
"Let's define the lengths of the ropes with variables:
- Let \( R \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we can substitute the expressions for \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation. From the second relationship, we can express \( B \) as \( B = Y - 7 \). Substituting this into the first relationship gives \( R = 4(Y - 7) \).

Now, substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37. \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37, \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37. \]

Add 35 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6Y = 72. \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ Y = 12. \]

Now that we have \( Y \), we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5, \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20. \]

So, the length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."
"First, let's determine how much money Rissa was given. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars. According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, Rissa gave $3 to their little sister. Since Ronnie gave the same amount to their little sister, he also gave $3. Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's possession is:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

The amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Given that the mural uses 12 pints of paint in total and that half of the mural is yellow, we can determine the amount of yellow paint used first. Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is:

\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

This leaves the other half of the mural to be painted with red, white, and purple paint. Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we can denote the amount of each as \( x \). Therefore, the total amount of red, white, and purple paint is:

\[ x + x + x = 3x \]

Since the total amount of paint used for red, white, and purple is the other half of the mural, it is also 6 pints. Thus, we have:

\[ 3x = 6 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{6}{3} = 2 \]

So, the amount of red paint used is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, calculate the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \, \text{feet} \times 12 \, \text{feet} = 240 \, \text{square feet} \]

Next, find the area of the living room, which is 5 times the area of one bedroom:
\[ \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \, \text{square feet} = 1200 \, \text{square feet} \]

Now, calculate the total area of the 4 bedrooms:
\[ \text{Total area of 4 bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \, \text{square feet} = 960 \, \text{square feet} \]

Add the area of the living room and the rest of the house to find the total area of the house:
\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 960 \, \text{square feet} + 1200 \, \text{square feet} + 1000 \, \text{square feet} = 3160 \, \text{square feet} \]

The total area of the house is:
\[ 3160 \, \text{square feet} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cloud puffs Alice counts each day and then sum them up for the five days.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
2. **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Monday, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the puffs counted each day:
\[ 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 \]

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]
\[ 9 + 12 = 21 \]
\[ 21 + 24 = 45 \]
\[ 45 + 48 = 93 \]

So, the total number of cloud puffs Alice counts from Monday to Friday is:
\[ \boxed{93} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of pods in the special size box. The regular box contains 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods.

\[ 100 \text{ pods} + 20\% \text{ of } 100 \text{ pods} = 100 + 0.20 \times 100 = 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. To find the cost per pod in the special size box, we divide the total cost by the number of pods:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Since the cost per pod is $0.10, the number of pods you can get for $1 is:

\[ \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}} = 10 \text{ pods} \]

If you use 1 pod per cycle, then with $1, you can run:

\[ 10 \text{ cycles} \]

Final numerical answer:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 20 dollar bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half for a Bill:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas then triples his money.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\) goals.
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\) goals.
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\) goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is **16**."
"To determine how many days the teacher can use the chalk before it needs to be recycled, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
   - He used 45% of the chalk on Monday.
   - Remaining chalk = 5 inches - (45% of 5 inches) = 5 inches - (0.45 * 5 inches) = 5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches.

2. **Determine the daily usage:**
   - The teacher plans to use 20% of the chalk each day.
   - Daily usage = 20% of the remaining chalk.

3. **Calculate the number of days before the chalk is recycled:**
   - The teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches.
   - We need to find out how many days it takes for the remaining chalk to fall below 2 inches.

Let's denote the remaining chalk after \( n \) days as \( C_n \).

- Initial remaining chalk \( C_0 = 2.75 \) inches.
- Daily usage = 20% of the remaining chalk.

The remaining chalk after each day can be calculated as:
\[ C_{n+1} = C_n - 0.2 \times C_n = 0.8 \times C_n \]

We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( C_n < 2 \) inches.

Let's calculate the remaining chalk for each day:

- Day 1: \( C_1 = 0.8 \times 2.75 = 2.2 \) inches.
- Day 2: \( C_2 = 0.8 \times 2.2 = 1.76 \) inches.

Since \( C_2 = 1.76 \) inches is less than 2 inches, the teacher will need to recycle the chalk by the end of the second day.

Therefore, the teacher has \(\boxed{2}\) days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk."
"First, let's calculate the number of girls on varsity. Since one-third of the girls are on varsity, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of boys on varsity. Since one-fourth of the boys are on varsity, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys}
\]

Now, we find the total number of students on varsity by adding the number of girls and boys on varsity:

\[
4 + 3 = 7 \text{ students}
\]

The total number of students in the class is:

\[
12 + 12 = 24 \text{ students}
\]

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:

\[
24 - 7 = 17 \text{ students}
\]

Therefore, the number of students not on varsity is:

\[

"First, let's determine the total number of teeth the dentist fixes. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more than that, which means the dentist caps \(4 + 7 = 11\) teeth.

The total number of teeth fixed by the dentist is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped, which is \(4 + 11 = 15\).

Next, we need to find what percentage of James' 30 teeth this represents. The formula to calculate the percentage is:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\%
\]

So, the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes is \(\boxed{50\%}\)."
"First, we need to determine how much milk Mr. Marcellus returned to the company. He returned 2/5 of the 4000 gallons of milk.

\[ \text{Amount of milk returned} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we calculate the refund amount by multiplying the amount of milk returned by the cost per gallon.

\[ \text{Refund amount} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$5600 \]

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of \(\$5600\)."
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( C \) be Colin's current age.
- Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   This can be written as:
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   This can be written as:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, we can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 5(C + 7)
\]
Simplify the right side:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7)
\]
To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7)
\]
Distribute the 3 and the 5:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]
Rearrange the equation to isolate \( C \):
\[
75 - 35 = 5C - 3C
\]
\[
40 = 2C
\]
Solve for \( C \):
\[
C = 20
\]

So, Colin is currently \(\boxed{20}\) years old."
"First, we need to determine how much money Bob spends on books per school. Since he distributes $27000 equally among 3 schools, we divide $27000 by 3:

\[ \frac{27000}{3} = 9000 \]

So, Bob spends $9000 on books for each school.

Next, we need to find out how many books he can buy with $9000. We know that 100 books cost $500. To find out how many books can be bought with $9000, we first determine how many sets of $500 are in $9000:

\[ \frac{9000}{500} = 18 \]

This means that with $9000, Bob can buy 18 sets of 100 books. Therefore, the total number of books he can buy is:

\[ 18 \times 100 = 1800 \]

So, Bob can buy 1800 books per school.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 1800 \]"
"Let's break down the sequence of events to determine how many apples Newton brought home.

1. **Initial Apples:**
   - Two apples fell out of the tree.
   - Newton picked up both apples and put one in his pocket, throwing the other one into the tree.

2. **First Throw:**
   - Newton threw the apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out.
   - Newton picked up these 5 apples and put all but one in his pocket, throwing the remaining one back at the tree.

3. **Second Throw:**
   - Newton threw the apple back at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out.
   - Newton picked up all of these 6 apples and went home.

Now, let's count the apples Newton brought home:

- Initially, Newton picked up 2 apples and put 1 in his pocket, so he had 1 apple in his pocket.
- After the first throw, he picked up 5 apples and put 4 in his pocket, so he had 1 + 4 = 5 apples in his pocket.
- After the second throw, he picked up 6 apples and went home with all 6 of these apples.

Adding these together:
- Apples in his pocket after the first throw: 4
- Apples picked up after the second throw: 6

So, the total number of apples Newton brought home is:
\[ 4 + 6 = 10 \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices Kate's friends will eat:

Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices, and there are 6 friends, so:
\[ 6 \text{ slices/friend} \times 6 \text{ friends} = 36 \text{ cheese slices} \]

Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices Kate's friends will eat:

Each friend eats 4 pepperoni pizza slices, and there are 6 friends, so:

"To solve this problem, we need to account for both the rate at which Jay builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Rate of building snowballs**: Jay builds 20 snowballs per hour.
2. **Rate of melting snowballs**: 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the number of 15-minute intervals in an hour is 4. Therefore, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, and in an hour, \(2 \times 4 = 8\) snowballs melt.

So, the net rate of increase in the number of snowballs Jay has is:
\[ 20 \text{ (built per hour)} - 8 \text{ (melted per hour)} = 12 \text{ snowballs per hour} \]

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. Since he gains 12 snowballs per hour, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 12 \text{ snowballs/hour} \times t \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ snowballs} \]

Solving for \(t\):
\[ t = \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs."

1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

They all ate a total of 6 slices of apple."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the end of the third day to the beginning of the first day.

1. **End of the third day:**
   - They had 78 bandages left.

2. **Third day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs (2 * 50 = 100 bandages).
   - They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages.
   - Before using 25 bandages, they had 78 + 25 = 103 bandages.
   - Before ordering 100 bandages, they had 103 - 100 = 3 bandages at the start of the third day.

3. **Second day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so if they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages on the second day, they had 3 + 28 = 31 bandages at the start of the second day.

4. **First day:**
   - They ordered one bulk pack (50 bandages) and used 38 bandages.
   - Before using 38 bandages, they had 31 + 50 = 81 bandages at the start of the first day.

Therefore, they started with 81 bandages on the first day."

\[50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320\]

So, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"First, let's calculate the number of red pens Alain's mom bought. Since she bought 5 packs of red pens and each pack contains 5 pens, the total number of red pens is:

\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens per pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of black pens. According to the problem, the number of black pens is twice the number of red pens. Therefore, the total number of black pens is:

\[ 2 \times 25 \text{ red pens} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

Now, to find the total number of pens, we add the number of red pens and the number of black pens together:

\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 75 \]"
"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The cost of cognac per bottle is 50% more than the cost of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the 20 bottles of cognac:

\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount John spends:

\[ 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount John spends on everything is:

\[ \boxed{2400} \]"
"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted:
- 20 White Oak trees.
- Twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, on the first day, he planted a total of \(20 + 40 = 60\) trees.

On the second day, he planted:
- 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which is \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day, which is \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, on the second day, he planted a total of \(30 + 50 = 80\) trees.

Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius over the two days is \(60 + 80 = 140\).

**Final Answer: 140**"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Amount**: Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.
2. **After Children's Consumption**: Fred's children drank 4 gallons.
   \[
   24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
   \]
3. **After Wife's Spill**: Fred's wife spilled 7 gallons.
   \[
   20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons}
   \]
4. **After Friend's Consumption**: Fred's friend Ronnie drank 5 gallons.
   \[
   13 - 5 = 8 \text{ gallons}
   \]

On the fourth day, 3 people (including Fred) showed up for the party. The remaining root beer is 8 gallons, which they will share equally.

5. **Amount per Person**: Divide the remaining 8 gallons by 3 people.
   \[
   \frac{8}{3} \approx 2.67 \text{ gallons per person}
   \]

So, the amount of root beer available for each person to drink during the party is approximately 2.67 gallons."
"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \( 8 \).

**Final Answer:**
8"
"First, let's calculate the number of fish that have red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after removing the fish with red stripes:

\[
66 - 22 = 44
\]

Now, we calculate the number of fish that have blue stripes. According to the problem, 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. So, we calculate:

\[
\frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

Therefore, 20 fish have blue stripes.

To find the total number of fish that have either red stripes or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[
22 + 20 = 42
\]

So, the total number of fish that have red stripes and blue stripes is:

\[
42
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy originally had:

- Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each, so that's \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
- She also had three makeup sets with six colors each, so that's \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.

Adding these together, Amy originally had \(8 + 18 = 26\) eyeshadow colors.

Next, we account for the colors stolen by her sister:
- Her sister steals one of the eyeshadow palettes, which has 4 colors. So, \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors left.

Then, we account for the colors Amy uses up:
- Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which originally had 6 colors. Half of 6 is \(6 / 2 = 3\) colors used up. So, \(22 - 3 = 19\) colors left.

Therefore, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is \(19\)."
"First, let's determine the height of Mattison's two-story house. Since the house is 7 times as high as Mattison, and Mattison is 60 inches tall, the height of the house is:

\[ 60 \text{ inches} \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find the height of the first floor to the ceiling. This height is thrice as high as Mattison, so:

\[ 60 \text{ inches} \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

The height of the house is the sum of the height of the first floor to the ceiling and the height of the second floor. Therefore, the height of the second floor is:

\[ 420 \text{ inches} - 180 \text{ inches} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Thus, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:

\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"First, we calculate how many shells team Alphas found. Since they found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

This means that 280 shells were found by team Alphas. The remaining shells are:

\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Next, we calculate how many of these remaining shells team The finders found. They found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

So, team The finders found 252 shells. The remaining shells, which were found by team Gogetters, are:

\[ 420 - 252 = 168 \]

Therefore, team Gogetters found:

\[ \boxed{168} \]"
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

Given:
- The average miles walked per day by the 4 dogs is 3 miles.
- The total number of dogs is 4.
- The first dog needs 1 mile.
- The second dog needs 4 miles.
- The third dog needs 3 miles.

First, calculate the total miles walked by all dogs combined:
\[ \text{Total miles} = \text{Average miles per day} \times \text{Number of dogs} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, sum the miles walked by the first three dogs:
\[ \text{Miles walked by the first three dogs} = 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \text{ miles} \]

Now, subtract the miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles to find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk:
\[ \text{Miles needed by the last dog} = \text{Total miles} - \text{Miles walked by the first three dogs} = 12 - 8 = 4 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day."
"First, we calculate the amount of the loan John gets, which is 40% of the value of his house.

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, we determine how much of this loan amount John uses to pay off his debts, which is 60% of the loan amount.

\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Finally, we find out how much money John has leftover after paying off his debts.

\[ \text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

Therefore, the amount of money John had leftover after paying off his debts is $40,000."
"First, we need to calculate the total weight of the tunas Deandre caught. The weights of the tunas are as follows:
- The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms.
- The second tuna weighs 46 kilograms.
- The last tuna weighs 26 kilograms.

Adding these weights together:
\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings from selling these tunas. The price per kilogram of tuna is $0.50. Therefore, the total earnings can be calculated by multiplying the total weight by the price per kilogram:
\[ 128 \times 0.50 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Deandre will earn \(\boxed{64}\) dollars after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To find Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines and then subtract the buying price from it.

1. **Calculate the selling price:**
   Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought them for $72.

   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8}
   \]

2. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \times 1.375 = 99
   \]

   So, the selling price is $99.

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   Profit is the difference between the selling price and the buying price.

   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} = 99 - 72 = 27
   \]

**Final Answer:**
Trinity's profit is $27."
"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day on the low setting.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting.
   - Total water removed on the low setting: \( 1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters} \).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, the medium setting removes \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the medium setting.
   - Total water removed on the medium setting: \( 2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters} \).

3. **High Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - Therefore, the high setting removes \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier for 5 days on the high setting.
   - Total water removed on the high setting: \( 4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters} \).

Finally, we sum the water removed at each setting to find the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement:

\[
3 \, \text{liters} + 6 \, \text{liters} + 20 \, \text{liters} = 29 \, \text{liters}
\]

**Total amount of water removed: 29 liters.**"

"First, let's calculate the total amount of medicine for one dose.

For one dose:
- The first medicine is 14 mL.
- The second medicine is 3 times the amount of the first medicine, which is \(3 \times 14 = 42\) mL.

So, for one dose, the total amount of medicine is:
\[ 14 \, \text{mL} + 42 \, \text{mL} = 56 \, \text{mL} \]

Now, to find the total amount of medicine for 8 doses:
\[ 56 \, \text{mL/dose} \times 8 \, \text{doses} = 448 \, \text{mL} \]

Therefore, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is:

"First, we need to determine the capacity of each class at Ali's school and John's school.

Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

Each of John's classes has a capacity that is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of Ali's class capacity. Therefore, the capacity of one of John's classes is:
\[ \frac{1}{8} \times 120 = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:
\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, we add the capacities of both schools to find the combined capacity:
\[ 120 + 30 = 150 \]

The combined capacity of both schools is:
\[ 150 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen owes his sister, including the 2% interest on the $300 borrowed.

The interest amount is:
\[ 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen owes is:
\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 each month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in 11 months is:
\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

The remaining amount that Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is the total amount minus the amount already paid:
\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of diaper changes needed per day for both children. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day and there are 2 children:

\[ 5 \text{ changes/child/day} \times 2 \text{ children} = 10 \text{ changes/day} \]

Jordan's wife changes half of these diaper changes. Therefore, she changes:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes} \]

Since Jordan changes the other half, the number of diaper changes Jordan does per day is also:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes} \]

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day. 

Jordan changes 5 diapers per day."
"First, let's calculate the volume of the jar. The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall. The volume \( V \) of the jar is given by:

\[ V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to determine the effective volume that can be occupied by the jelly beans, considering the packing efficiency. The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume \( V_{\text{eff}} \) is:

\[ V_{\text{eff}} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches. Therefore, the maximum number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is:

\[ \text{Maximum number of jelly beans} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \]

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red. Therefore, the estimated number of red jelly beans is:

\[ \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900. The difference between the true number and Tim's estimate is:

\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

So, Tim's guess was off by:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of people on the bus**: 20 people.
2. **People entering at the first stop**: 40 people.
3. **Total number of people on the bus after the first stop**: \(20 + 40 = 60\) people.
4. **People entering at the second stop**: \(\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30\) people.
5. **Total number of people on the bus after the second stop**: \(60 + 30 = 90\) people.
6. **People entering at the third stop**: The number of passengers on the bus doubled, so \(90 \times 2 = 180\) people.
7. **Total number of people on the bus after the third stop**: \(90 + 180 = 270\) people.

Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, it is impossible to have 270 people on the bus. However, the question asks for the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, assuming the bus could hypothetically hold more than its capacity.

The bus's capacity is 200 people, and currently, it has 270 people on it. Therefore, the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is:

\[200 - 270 = -70\]

Since the bus cannot have a negative number of people, the correct interpretation is that the bus is already over its capacity by 70 people. Thus, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is:

\(\boxed{0}\)"
"First, let's calculate the initial cost of one visit and the total cost for the first 5 years.

1. **Initial cost of one visit**: $2
2. **Number of visits per year**: 3
3. **Total visits in 5 years**: \(3 \times 5 = 15\)
4. **Total cost for 5 years**: \(15 \times 2 = 30\)

Next, we need to calculate the new cost of one visit after a 150% increase.

5. **Increase in cost**: \(150\% \times 2 = 1.5 \times 2 = 3\)
6. **New cost of one visit**: \(2 + 3 = 5\)

Now, we calculate the total cost for the next 3 years.

7. **Number of visits per year for the next 3 years**: 3
8. **Total visits in 3 years**: \(3 \times 3 = 9\)
9. **Total cost for 3 years**: \(9 \times 5 = 45\)

Finally, we add the costs from the first 5 years and the next 3 years to get the total amount spent.

10. **Total amount spent**: \(30 + 45 = 75\)

"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the wooden tables and the roof frames separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the wooden tables:
- John made 4 wooden tables.
- Each table costs $20.
- Therefore, the total cost for the wooden tables is \(4 \times 20 = 80\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the roof frames:
- John made 2 roof frames.
- Each roof frame costs $10.
- Therefore, the total cost for the roof frames is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the wooden tables and the roof frames to find the final amount Ali has to pay:
- Total cost for wooden tables: $80
- Total cost for roof frames: $20
- Therefore, the total amount Ali has to pay is \(80 + 20 = 100\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:
100 dollars."
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we calculate the length of the longer piece as:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is \(\boxed{32}\) feet."

Therefore, the number of inches of rain expected on Tuesday is 5 inches."
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( c \) be the number of cupcakes.
- Let \( b \) be the number of brownies.

From the problem, we know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be written as:
\[ b = 3c - 2 \]

We also know that Carly's class has five people and each person gets two treats. Therefore, the total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]
So, the total number of treats is:
\[ c + b = 10 \]

Now, we substitute the expression for \( b \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]
Simplify the equation:
\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]
Add 2 to both sides:
\[ 4c = 12 \]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[ c = 3 \]

So, Carly made \(\boxed{3}\) cupcakes."
"First, calculate the discounted price for both a manicure and a pedicure:

- The original price for a manicure is $35.
- The original price for a pedicure is $40.
- The discount offered is 20%.

The discount amount for the manicure is:
\[ 35 \times 0.20 = 7 \]

So, the discounted price for the manicure is:
\[ 35 - 7 = 28 \]

The discount amount for the pedicure is:
\[ 40 \times 0.20 = 8 \]

So, the discounted price for the pedicure is:
\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \]

Next, calculate the total cost for both the discounted manicure and pedicure:
\[ 28 + 32 = 60 \]

Now, calculate the cost for the nail art. Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers in total, the cost for nail art is:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Finally, add the cost of the nail art to the total cost of the discounted manicure and pedicure:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

So, the total amount Karen would pay is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of issues Susan receives from each magazine type:

1. For the 3 magazines that each send 12 issues a year:
\[ 3 \text{ magazines} \times 12 \text{ issues/magazine} = 36 \text{ issues} \]

2. For the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
\[ 1 \text{ magazine} \times 6 \text{ issues/magazine} = 6 \text{ issues} \]

3. For the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
\[ 4 \times 6 \text{ issues} = 24 \text{ issues} \]

Now, let's add up all the issues:
\[ 36 \text{ issues} + 6 \text{ issues} + 24 \text{ issues} = 66 \text{ issues} \]

So, Susan gets a total of 66 issues every year. However, the question asks for the total number of magazines she gets every year, not the total number of issues. We need to count the number of magazines:

"Let's define the number of paintings each person has using variables:
- Let \( S \) be the number of paintings Samantha has.
- Let \( Sh \) be the number of paintings Shelley has.
- Let \( K \) be the number of paintings Kim has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, which can be written as:
   \[
   S = Sh - 12
   \]
2. Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, which can be written as:
   \[
   Sh = K + 8
   \]
3. Samantha has 27 paintings, so:
   \[
   S = 27
   \]

Substituting the value of \( S \) into the first equation:
\[
27 = Sh - 12
\]
Solving for \( Sh \):
\[
Sh = 27 + 12 = 39
\]

Now, substituting the value of \( Sh \) into the second equation:
\[
39 = K + 8
\]
Solving for \( K \):
\[
K = 39 - 8 = 31
\]

Therefore, Kim has \(\boxed{31}\) paintings."
"First, calculate the price increase in December:

The original price in November was $40. An 80% increase means the price went up by \(40 \times 0.80 = 32\) dollars.

So, the new price in December is \(40 + 32 = 72\) dollars.

Next, calculate the price decrease in January:

A 50% decrease on the December price means the price went down by \(72 \times 0.50 = 36\) dollars.

So, the new price in January is \(72 - 36 = 36\) dollars.

Therefore, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"First, let's calculate the amount Charlie earns from his standard lessons. He charges $80 per hour and has 4 such lessons:

\[ 4 \text{ lessons} \times \$80 \text{ per lesson} = \$320 \]

Next, we need to determine the reduced rate for lessons with veterans. The rate is reduced by 25%, so the new rate is 75% of the standard rate:

\[ 75\% \text{ of } \$80 = 0.75 \times \$80 = \$60 \]

Charlie has 2 veteran lessons at this reduced rate:

\[ 2 \text{ lessons} \times \$60 \text{ per lesson} = \$120 \]

Now, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make for the day:

\[ \$320 + \$120 = \$440 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is:

\[ \$440 \]"

First, calculate \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 20:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
\]
So, Eve is left with 5 pomelos.

To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number:
\[
20 - 5 = 15
\]

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos."
"First, let's calculate how many apples Walter ate. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 apples.

\[ \text{Apples eaten} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, the number of apples remaining after Walter ate some is:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Next, Walter gave 25% of the remaining apples to his sister. To find out how many apples that is, we calculate 25% of 36.

\[ \text{Apples given to sister} = 0.25 \times 36 = 9 \]

So, the number of apples remaining after giving some to his sister is:

\[ 36 - 9 = 27 \]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. The total money he received is:

\[ 27 \times 3 = 81 \]

Therefore, the money Walter received is:

"To find out how many novels Regina has written this year, we can set up the problem using the information given.

Let \( x \) be the number of novels Regina has written this year. According to the problem, 9 novels represent 3 quarters (or \(\frac{3}{4}\)) of the number of novels she has written this year. This can be written as:

\[
\frac{3}{4}x = 9
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):

\[
x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3}
\]

Now, perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 9 \times 1.3333 = 12
\]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

"To determine the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.**

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr. If he travels for 24 hours a day (assuming he drives continuously without stops for simplicity, though the problem states he takes necessary stops), the distance he covers in one day is:
\[ 50 \, \text{km/hr} \times 24 \, \text{hr/day} = 1200 \, \text{km/day} \]

Over 3 days, the total distance he covers is:
\[ 1200 \, \text{km/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3600 \, \text{km} \]

**Step 2: Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.**

The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. The percentage of this distance that Michael has covered is:
\[ \left( \frac{3600 \, \text{km}}{6000 \, \text{km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many grapes were used to make the pies. Since each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes and their mother made 4 pies, we calculate:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

Now, we add the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and her mother to find the total number of grapes used:

\[ 6 + 30 + 48 = 84 \text{ grapes} \]

Therefore, the total number of grapes at the beginning was:

\[ \boxed{84} \]"

Then, add the number of substitute teachers to the result:
\[ 69 + 9 = 78 \]

So, the number of teachers at school that day was 78."
"To determine how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to break down the costs and then calculate the annual expenditure.

1. **Cost of Pasta:**
   - Bud uses 1 box of pasta per week.
   - The cost of one box of pasta is $1.00.
   - Therefore, the weekly cost of pasta is $1.00.

2. **Cost of Cheddar Cheese:**
   - Bud spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese per week.

3. **Cost of Gruyere Cheese:**
   - Bud spends twice the amount on gruyere cheese as he does on cheddar cheese.
   - Therefore, the cost of gruyere cheese per week is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) dollars.

4. **Total Weekly Cost:**
   - Adding up the costs for one week:
     \[
     1 \text{ (pasta)} + 3 \text{ (cheddar cheese)} + 6 \text{ (gruyere cheese)} = 10 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Annual Cost:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Therefore, the annual cost is:
     \[
     10 \text{ dollars/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 520 \text{ dollars/year}
     \]

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.

Each classroom takes 15 minutes to clean, so for 80 classrooms:
\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many minutes the custodian has available each day to clean. Since they work an 8-hour day:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to clean all the classrooms:
\[ \frac{1200 \text{ minutes}}{480 \text{ minutes/day}} = 2.5 \text{ days} \]

Since the custodian has 5 days to complete the task, they can clean all the classrooms within the given time frame. Now, we need to calculate the average percentage of their day spent cleaning.

The total time spent cleaning per day is 480 minutes, and the percentage of the day spent cleaning is:
\[ \left( \frac{480 \text{ minutes}}{480 \text{ minutes/day}} \right) \times 100 = 100\% \]

However, since they only need 2.5 days to clean all the classrooms, we need to find the average percentage of the day spent cleaning over the 5 days. The total time spent cleaning over 5 days is:
\[ 2.5 \text{ days} \times 480 \text{ minutes/day} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

The average time spent cleaning per day is:
\[ \frac{1200 \text{ minutes}}{5 \text{ days}} = 240 \text{ minutes/day} \]

The percentage of the day spent cleaning is:
\[ \left( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{480 \text{ minutes/day}} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

Therefore, the average percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms is:
\[ 50\% \]"
"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:

- The middle 2 shelves together can hold \(10 + 10 = 20\) books.
- Adding the bottom and top shelves, the total capacity of one bookcase is \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \text{ dozens} \times \$2.40 \text{ per dozen} = \$12.00 \]

Next, let's determine the total revenue from selling the eggs.

Rose sells the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, five dozens contain:
\[ 5 \text{ dozens} \times 12 \text{ eggs per dozen} = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

To find out how many sets of 3 eggs are in 60 eggs, we divide 60 by 3:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ eggs}}{3 \text{ eggs per set}} = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total revenue is:
\[ 20 \text{ sets} \times \$1 \text{ per set} = \$20.00 \]

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \$20.00 - \$12.00 = \$8.00 \]

Therefore, Rose's profit is:
\[ \$8.00 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of red hats. Since half of the hats are red, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hats are left after removing the red hats:

\[ \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Out of these remaining hats, \( \frac{3}{5} \) are blue. So, the number of blue hats is:

\[ \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

The rest of the hats are white. To find the number of white hats, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats:

\[ \text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of white hats Skyler has is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the beef jerky after the discount. The original price is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount, so the new price is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per stick of beef jerky. Since there are 30 sticks in a bag and the bag now costs $15.00, the cost per stick is:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.50 to cents:

\[ 0.50 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ cents} \]

So, the cost per stick of jerky is:

\[ 50 \text{ cents} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass, which is 70% of the total questions from both tests.

The first test has 70 questions, and she gets 60% of them correct:
\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \text{ questions correct} \]

The second test has 40 questions. Let's denote the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test as \( x \).

The total number of questions from both tests is:
\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

To pass, Audrey needs to answer 70% of these 110 questions correctly:
\[ 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \text{ questions correct} \]

Since she already got 42 questions correct from the first test, the number of questions she needs to get correct on the second test is:
\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes Mary makes as \( S \). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes, \( B \), is given by the expression \( 5S - 4 \).

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes, which is given as 116. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) into the equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6 to solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know \( S = 20 \), we can find \( B \) using the expression \( B = 5S - 4 \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \( 96 \).

"John takes 5 minutes for the first side. 

For the second and third sides, it takes him twice as long as the first side, so:
- Second side: \(5 \times 2 = 10\) minutes
- Third side: \(5 \times 2 = 10\) minutes

For the last two sides, it takes him half as long as the first side, so:
- Fourth side: \(5 \div 2 = 2.5\) minutes
- Fifth side: \(5 \div 2 = 2.5\) minutes

The sixth side is implied to take the same time as the fifth side, so:
- Sixth side: \(2.5\) minutes

$47.00 * 5 = $235.00

Therefore, Alicia spends $235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"First, we need to determine John's new speaking speed after training. His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster:

\[ 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of words John needs to speak. Each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages:

\[ 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take him to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. We do this by dividing the total number of words by his speaking speed:

\[ \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - Number of people = 50

2. **Second Day:**
   - Number of people = 50 + 20 = 70

3. **Third Day:**
   - Number of people = 2 * 70 = 140

4. **Rest of the Week (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th days):**
   - Average number of people per day = 60
   - Total number of people for the rest of the week = 60 * 4 = 240

5. **Total Number of People for the Week:**
   - Sum of people from all days = 50 (first day) + 70 (second day) + 140 (third day) + 240 (rest of the week)
   - Total = 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 500

**Final Answer:**

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds**: 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate is three times the initial rate, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Following 30 seconds**: The popping rate is four times the initial rate, so \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds**: The popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, we need to account for the kernels that pop from the residual heat after the pan is taken off the heat. A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. So, \(\frac{40}{4} = 10\) more kernels pop.

Adding all these together:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210\]

So, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is \(\boxed{210}\)."
"To determine how many lemons Tim will need, we need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required and then convert that into the number of lemons.

1. **Calculate the lemon juice needed for the regular lemonade:**
   - Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade.
   - Each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice.
   - Therefore, for 4 gallons, he needs \(4 \times 1 = 4\) cups of lemon juice.

2. **Calculate the lemon juice needed for the extra gallon of lemonade:**
   - The extra gallon is twice as tart, which means it requires twice the amount of lemon juice.
   - Therefore, for the extra gallon, he needs \(2 \times 1 = 2\) cups of lemon juice.

3. **Calculate the total lemon juice needed:**
   - Total lemon juice needed = lemon juice for 4 gallons + lemon juice for the extra gallon.
   - Total lemon juice needed = \(4 + 2 = 6\) cups of lemon juice.

4. **Convert the total lemon juice needed into the number of lemons:**
   - 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
   - Therefore, for 6 cups of lemon juice, he needs \(6 \times 6 = 36\) lemons.

**Final Answer:**
Tim will need 36 lemons."

"Let's denote the number of red blocks as \( r \).

According to the problem, the tower is made out of:
- 4 blue blocks
- Twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, which is \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) yellow blocks
- An unknown number of red blocks, which we denote as \( r \)

The total number of blocks in the tower is given as 32. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of blocks:

\[ 4 \text{ (blue blocks)} + 8 \text{ (yellow blocks)} + r \text{ (red blocks)} = 32 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 4 + 8 + r = 32 \]

Combine the constants:

\[ 12 + r = 32 \]

To find \( r \), subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:

\[ r = 32 - 12 \]

\[ r = 20 \]

So, the number of red blocks is \( 20 \).

\[ 6 \text{ dollars/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the ice cream cones for Ryan and his 3 friends:
\[ 4 \text{ people} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars/person} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the ice cream from the total allowance to find out how much money Ryan has left:
\[ 18 \text{ dollars} - 5 \text{ dollars} = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, calculate the cost of one movie ticket:
\[ 6.50 \text{ dollars/ticket} \]

To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining money, divide the remaining money by the cost of one movie ticket:
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{13 \text{ dollars}}{6.50 \text{ dollars/ticket}} \right\rfloor = 2 \text{ tickets} \]

Ryan can buy \(\boxed{2}\) movie tickets."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Ellen spent:
- Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100.
- She also bought a photo frame for $5.

So, Ellen's total expenditure is:
\[ 100 + 5 = 105 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount Lani spent:
- Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30.
- She also bought two bathrobes, each costing $100.

So, the cost of the two bathrobes is:
\[ 100 \times 2 = 200 \]

Adding the cost of the sunglasses:
\[ 30 + 200 = 230 \]

Now, we add Ellen's and Lani's total expenditures to find the combined total:

"First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar of the mixture:

- Passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20

Total cost for one jar = $12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44

Next, calculate the profit for one jar:
- Selling price per jar = $50
- Cost per jar = $44
- Profit per jar = $50 - $44 = $6

Now, calculate the profit for 10 jars:
- Profit for 10 jars = 10 * $6 = $60

Final numerical answer:
$60"
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and then sum these values.

1. **Quarters**: Each quarter is worth $0.25. Justin has 32 quarters.
   \[
   32 \times 0.25 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth $0.10. Justin has 95 dimes.
   \[
   95 \times 0.10 = 9.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth $0.05. Justin has 120 nickels.
   \[
   120 \times 0.05 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth $0.01. Justin has 750 pennies.
   \[
   750 \times 0.01 = 7.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum the values of all the coins:
\[
8 + 9.50 + 6 + 7.50 = 31 \text{ dollars}

The total dollar amount in the jar is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janet spent at the mall.

1. Ice cream: $3.50
2. Movie tickets (for herself and her sister): $7.50 each, so $7.50 × 2 = $15.00
3. Bracelet: $8.50

Now, let's add these amounts together to find the total expenditure:
\[ 3.50 + 15.00 + 8.50 = 27.00 \]

Janet's parents gave her $40. To find out how much she has left, we subtract her total expenditure from the amount given by her parents:
\[ 40.00 - 27.00 = 13.00 \]

So, Janet has $13.00 left."
"First, let's determine how many days Josh is open in a week. Since he is closed on Sunday and Wednesday, he is open for 5 days a week.

Next, we calculate how many cars he services in a week:
\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 15 \text{ cars/week} \]

Now, we calculate his weekly earnings:
\[ 15 \text{ cars/week} \times \$4/\text{car} = \$60/\text{week} \]

To find out how much he makes in 2 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2:
\[ \$60/\text{week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = \$120 \]

Therefore, Josh makes \(\$120\) in 2 weeks."

First, calculate the number of toy soldiers in each half:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

Next, calculate the earnings from selling 6 toy soldiers at $5 each:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \]

Then, calculate the earnings from selling the other 6 toy soldiers at $7 each:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \]

Finally, add the earnings from both halves to find the total amount of money Matthew would earn:
\[ 30 + 42 = 72 \]

Matthew would earn \(\boxed{72}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate gets home, he starts filling holes at a rate of 9 holes a day, but the dog continues to dig 6 new holes each night. Therefore, the net change in the number of holes each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes filled} - 6 \text{ holes dug} = 3 \text{ holes filled per day} \]

Now, we need to determine how many days it takes to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes."
"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School, and Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 \]

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = 3000 \]

Now, to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract the average enrollment of Butler High School from that of Norman High School:

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 4000 - 3000 \]

\[ \text{Difference in enrollment} = 1000 \]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School."

The Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"Let's define the variables for the quantities of items Igor gathered:
- Let \( t \) be the number of test tubes Igor gathered.
- Let \( b \) be the number of beakers Igor gathered.
- Let \( p \) be the number of Petri dishes Igor gathered.

From the problem, we know the following:
1. Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, so \( t = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \).
2. Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, so \( p = 14 + 2 = 16 \).
3. The total number of items on the lab bench is 29, and since the number of beakers is \( b \), we have the equation:
   \[
   t + b + p = 29
   \]
   Substituting the values of \( t \) and \( p \) into the equation, we get:
   \[
   8 + b + 16 = 29
   \]
   Simplifying this, we find:
   \[
   24 + b = 29
   \]
   Solving for \( b \), we get:
   \[
   b = 29 - 24 = 5
   \]
   Since Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, and Igor gathered 5 beakers, the number of beakers Igor lost is:
   \[
   7 - 5 = 2
   \]

Therefore, the number of beakers Igor lost is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg requires 2 screws. Therefore, the number of screws needed per table is:
\[ 4 \text{ legs/table} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table} \]

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James starts with 40 screws. After using 32 screws, the number of screws left over is:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Therefore, the number of screws James will have left over is:
\[ 8 \]"
"There are 10 eggs in the first basket. The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, which means it has \(10 \times 2 = 20\) eggs.

Therefore, there are 30 eggs in both baskets put together."
"First, let's determine how much each person raised:

1. Alexandra raises $430.
2. Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.
3. Sarah raises $300.
4. Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add up the amounts raised by all four girls:

- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: $750
- Maryam: $700
- Sarah: $300

Total amount raised = $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180

Therefore, the total amount of money they all raised is $2180."
"First, let's establish the relationship between Aaron's and Vanessa's running speeds and distances.

Given:
- Vanessa ran 4 miles.
- Aaron ran half the distance Vanessa ran, so Aaron ran \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.
- Aaron's speed is twice Vanessa's speed.

Since Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes, we can calculate Aaron's speed in miles per minute:
\[ \text{Aaron's speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Since Aaron's speed is twice Vanessa's speed, Vanessa's speed is:
\[ \text{Vanessa's speed} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, we calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute}} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race."
"To determine how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we first calculate the total amount of line required based on the length of the dock.

Given:
- The caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.
- There are 200 feet of dock.

So, the total line required is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we account for the line he already has:
- He has 6 feet of new line.

Therefore, the amount of line he needs to buy is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

So, the caretaker needs to buy:
\[ \boxed{594} \text{ feet of line} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the meals and wine for one night:

- They order 2 meals at $5 each, so the cost for the meals is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars.
- They also order a $5 bottle of wine.

So, the total cost for one night is \(10 + 5 = 15\) dollars.

Since they are open 2 days a week, the total cost for the week is \(15 \times 2 = 30\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount they make in a week is $30."
"First, let's calculate the cost price per watermelon:

Total cost price for 50 watermelons = $80
Cost price per watermelon = $80 / 50 = $1.60

Next, we need to find the selling price per watermelon, given a profit of 25%.

Profit percentage = 25%
Profit per watermelon = 25% of $1.60 = 0.25 * $1.60 = $0.40

Therefore, the selling price per watermelon = Cost price per watermelon + Profit per watermelon
= $1.60 + $0.40 = $2.00

Each watermelon was sold for $2.00."
"First, let's determine Dora's current age. Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, she is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

Next, we know that James is twice as old as Dora. Therefore, James is currently \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

Now, we need to find out how old John was when James was born. Since James is currently 18 and John had James when he was 19, John is currently \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

The youngest son was born when John was 32. Therefore, the youngest son is currently \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour:**
   - Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour:**
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
     \]

3. **Find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:**
   - Ana peels 20 oranges.
   - Jane peels 15 oranges.
   - The difference is:
     \[
     20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges}

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and he gets it at 80% off. 

The discount amount is:
\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

So, the cost of the radiator after the discount is:
\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost for the mechanic's labor. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. Therefore, the labor cost is:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total amount Mark paid:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the total amount Mark paid is:
\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
- Let \( k \) be the number of cows.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can write these as two equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( 2c + 4k = 70 \) (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system of equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

To eliminate \( c \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \)."
"First, calculate the total number of pizza slices available:

Now, divide the total number of slices by the number of people to find out how many slices each person can have:
\[ \frac{56 \text{ slices}}{4 \text{ people}} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices of pizza."
